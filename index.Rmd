abstract: |
  This dissertation examines how varying levels of polarization and military
  prestige impact the US military's political involvement. It first argues that the
  political behavior of military and civilian actors with respect to the military
  should be viewed through the lens of three central principles of civil-military
  and the non-interference of the military into certain realms of the state. The dissertation
  then argues that the level of polarization and military prestige impact the willingness
  of military and civilian actors to adhere to these principles. Using a mixed methods
  approach involving both quantitative and historical analysis, this dissertation
  provides evidence that patterns of political activity involving the military change
  over time. Ultimately, this dissertation contributes to the scholarly understanding
  of how domestic factors shape the political activities involving the military in
  mature democracies.

relations: civilian control of the military, non-partisanship of the military institution
