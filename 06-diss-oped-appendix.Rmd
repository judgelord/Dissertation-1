# Appendix to Chapter Three {-}

This chapter Appendix roughly aligns with the chronological order of the chapter.   

## Word and Data-Base Searches to Obtain Data

I conducted two different sets of searches to obtain the data used in this study using data bases made available through the University of Wisconsin online library. Data collection occurred over the period from April 2020 - March 2021. This first set of search terms was applied to the Factiva and Nexus-Uni data bases. 

In the Factiva Database, I had to select the "type of article" or "subject" (Factiva Database) that I was searching for, and I included options such as "commentaries/opinions," "editorials," and "letters."

The specific terms of search included were as follows:

"retired Army General" or "former Army General" or "retired Navy Admiral" or "former Navy Admiral" or "retired Marine Corps General" or "former Marine Corps General" or "former Air Force General" or "retired Air Force General" or "retired Coast Guard Admiral" or "former Coast Guard Admiral" or "retired from the Marine Corps" or "retired from the Army" or "retired from the Navy" or "retired from the Air Force" or "retired from the Coast Guard" or "supreme commander of" or "commander of" or "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs" or "chairman of the joint chiefs" or "Supreme Commander of" or "Chief of Staff" or "Chief of Naval Operations" or "retired Army" or "retired Navy" or "retired Air Force" or "retired Marine Corps" or "retired Coast Guard" or "retired military" or "commandant of" or "director of" or "retired from the military"

The second set of search terms was applied to a data base known as Pro Quest Historical Newspapers, which the University of Wisconsin also had access to for both the _Wall Street Journal_ and the _New York Times_. Factiva included articles from the Wall Street Journal only back to the middle of 1994, so I relied heavily on Pro Quest to search through the Wall Street Journal from 1979-1994. Unlike the search terms used for Factiva and Nexus-Uni, however, I came to quickly realize that the opinion pieces I sought were not categorized as opinion-editorials or letters to the editor, but rather as "articles."  This required significantly more time searching for the desired data, as more articles had to be searched through and sifted. The specific terms of search included:

(retired OR former OR “chief of staff”) AND (“Army General” OR Gen. OR general OR "Navy Admiral" OR Adm. OR admiral OR "Marine Corps General" OR "Coast Guard Admiral" OR "Air Force General" OR "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs" OR "colonel" OR "captain" OR "commander" OR "chief of naval operations" OR "commandant" OR "director of")

## Observations Violating Principles of Civil-Military Relations 

Table \@ref(tab:appx-ch3-1) contains those observations that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. The table contains the name of the author, the title of the opinion piece, the year in which the opinion piece was authored, the topic addressed by the opinion piece, and a binary indicator of which principle(s) the piece violates.

# Main Regression Results Using Strict Levels of Polarization. 

The majority of this appendix presents the same results shown in the main body of chapter three, but using the non-smoothed levels of polarization. 

Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx1) presents the main results using strict (non-smoothed) levels of Congressional and affective polarization; that is, the level of polarization that was most recently measured in a formal way prior to the writing of the opinion piece. As I discuss in the main body of the chapter, there are two major differences between the results shown in Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx1) and the main regression Table from the main body of the chapter (Table \@ref(tab:ch3reg1)).

The first is that in Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx1), the positive and statistically significant finding for measures of congressional polarization is not robust to measures of affective polarization. The second is that in Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx1), the coefficient for election year is positive and statistically significant in some models (4-5). I discuss these differences in the main body of the chapter.

One important finding is that in models 1-3, the coefficients for house and senate polarization are statistically significant and positive. Note also that in these specifications, the coefficient for election year is not statistically significant, though in each of these models, the sign on the coefficient for election year is positive. 

The story is different, however, in models 4-6, where the dependent variable changes from the log of the odds that a publication violates the principle of civilian control to the principle of non-partisanship. Note that in all of these models, the coefficient for election year is positive and statistically significant, whereas the coefficient for polarization, regardless of type, is negative and statistically significant. These results, together, indicate that it is the presence of an election year that is associated with an increasing likelihood that retired military officer commentary violates the principle of non-partisanship, and that increasing polarization actually has the opposite effect - that increasing polarization makes it less likely a retired officer publication violates the principle of non-partisanship. Models 7-9 indicate that polarization has no impact on the likelihood that a particular commentary piece violates the principle of non-interference. 

The results shown in models 4-6 are particularly surprising, as we would not expect that rising polarization leads to a decrease in the likelihood that retired officer commentary violates the principle of non-partisanship. To further investigate how an election year and polarization impact the likelihood that a retired military officer opinion publication violates the principle of non-partisanship specifically, I run models 4-6 again, but drop the control for election year. The reason for dropping the control for election year is because I suspect that when included, it is perhaps capturing some of the work that polarization might be doing or at least contributing towards. These results are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx3).

Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx3) shows that when the controls for election year are removed, the coefficients for polarization remain negative but now are statistically insignificant, with the exception of model 3 that uses a measure of affective polarization. Combined with the results of models 4-6 in Table Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx2), these results mean that we cannot state that increasing polarization directly leads to an increase in the likelihood that retired military officer commentary violates the principle of non-partisanship in particular. This is an important result, as it provides a cautionary tone for the results of the main regression table. 

The word of caution is simply that increasing polarization seems to lead to an increase in the likelihood that retired military officer commentary violates _at least one_ of the principles of civil-military relations, and the principle of civilian control in particular, given that the coefficients for polarization in models 1-3 in Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx2) were all highly statistically significant and positive. The results therefore do not support the notion that increasing polarization leads to an increase in the likelihood that retired officer commentary will violate each principle, nor that it will necessarily violate the principles of non-partisanship and non-interference at all. 

Based off of the statistical analysis presented here, we can only state that increasing polarization is associated with an increased likelihood that retired military officers will violate at least one of the central principles of civil-military relations, and particularly, the principle of civilian control. Furthermore, this result is true, but only when we use congressional rather than affective measures of polarization.

## Robustness Tests

\doublespace

In this section of the Appendix, I demonstrate a series of robustness checks.

### Robustness to the Trump Presidency Years

I first include a series of robustness tests to the years of the Trump Presidency to determine whether the Trump years are in fact vital to obtaining the result that polarization drives the degree to which retired military officer commentary violates one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. To investigate this possibility, I truncate the data at certain years and then proceed with regression analysis that mirrors the models included in the chapter's main regression table. The results are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx4).

The results seem to indicate that including the Trump years matters, but only somewhat. For example, when the dependent variable is the proportion of annual commentary that violates one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations (models 1-4), the coefficient for polarization is not statistically significant in models 1 and 2, when the data is truncated to exclude commentary authored in the years 2018, 2019, and 20. However, when I include the year 2018 (models 3 and 4), polarization becomes statistically significant and positive.

\doublespace

In models 5-8, where the dependent variable is the log of the odds that a particular piece of commentary violates the central principles of civil-military relations, a statistically significant result for polarization is obtained beginning in model 7, and the result holds for model 8. 

Thus, the Trump Presidency years matter in terms of obtaining the positive and statistically significant results for polarization, but only a portion of the Presidency matters (2017 and 2017 matter when the dependent variable is the proportion that violates a central principle of civil-military relations, and only 2017 matters when the dependent variable is the log of the odds that a particular piece violates the principles).

## Robustness Checks to Interaction of Polarization and Military Prestige

I now run a series of models that check to see if any interaction between polarization and military prestige matters. The results, which are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx5), show that there is no meaningful impact of interacting polarization and military prestige, either when the dependent variable is the total number of pieces authored (model 1), the proportion of annual pieces that violate the principles of civil-military relations (model 2), or the log of the odds that a single piece violates one or more of the central principles (models 3 - 6).

Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx5) shows that when we interact trust in the military with the respective measurements of congressional polarization, the interaction terms are inconsistent in terms of direction and only statistically significant in three of the six models (models 4, 5, and 6). In model 4, the interaction term is statistically significant, but so are the coefficients for both trust in the military and polarization. Both of these are positive, while the interaction term is negative. So it becomes somewhat difficult to really isolate the potential impact of any sort of interaction between the two main independent variables of interest in model 4. Model 5 yields similar difficulties, but in the opposite manner: both of the independent variables by themselves are negative and statistically significant, while the interaction term is minimally positive but statistically significant. The results of model 6 are similar to model 4 in that the interaction term is negative and statistically significant, while the separate coefficients for the variables of military prestige (trust in the military) and polarization are each positive and statistically significant. 

In short, there are really no consistent patterns that emerge when an interaction term between polarization and military prestige are included that merit noteworthy attention. 

## Endogeneity Checks

The last major item of interest in this appendix include a series of checks for endogeneity. In line with the theory developed in chapter two, the most potentially problematic relationship involves instances of political behavior that violate the principles of civil-military relations and the level of trust in the military (military prestige). We might be particular concerned that acts of political behavior, in this case, the writing of opinion commentary by retired military officers, somehow drives the level of trust the public places in the military in a meaningful way. 

Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx6) presents the results of several OLS regressions in which the dependent variable is the level of trust the public places in the military. I include several control variables, including dichotomous indicators of instances of commentary that violate one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations (models 1-2), commentary that violates the principle of non-partisanship in particular (model 3), as well as an interaction term that captures the combined effect of polarization and an instance of retired officer commentary violating any of the central principles of civil-military relations or the principle of non-partisanship in particular (models 2 and 3, respectively).

The results of Table \@ref(tab:ch3appx6) indicate that there is not a strong and statistically significant relationship between instances of violations to the principles of civil-military relations and the level of trust the public places in the military. The coefficients for instance of violation of any central principle (models 1 and 2) and violation of the principle of non-partisanship (model 3) are all statistically insignificant. The coefficients on the interaction terms in models 2 and 3 are likewise statistically insignificant. Therefore, at least with respect to the behavior of authoring opinion commentary, endogeneity does not appear to pose a significant problem. The level of trust the public places in the military is not the result of instances of opinion commentary violating the central principles of civil-military relations.
