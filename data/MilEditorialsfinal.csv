John Lavelle may have made mistakes, but these were in the interest of saving American lives in a hopeless war in which Americans were constrained by arbitrary rules while fighting an enemy that knew no rules.","I was with Gen. John Lavelle when he died.
On July 11, The Post reported Gen. Lavelle's death with a brief summary of his career. Most of the report covered
his relief from command, reduction in rank, and retirement from the Air Force for directing a series of unauthorized
missions against targets in North Vietnam. With the passage of time, although facts remain the same, perspectives
become clearer. It was disappointing that The Post did not think this worthy of comment.
If the Vietnam War was difficult for americans, it was horrible for our Vietnamese allies. Policy direction came from
an American government that literally did not know what it was doing. At the height of our discontent, one
commentator, when asked about our policy in Vietnam, paused, then replied, ""Well, it isn't to win and it isn't to lose;
so it must be to stay there and kill people."" It makes little difference that this was not our policy, for this is what we
did for almost 10 years before physically and diplomatically retreating and leaving our allies to the tender mercies of
an invading Communist army.
Thousands of Americans lost their lives. As far as I know, this was the first war in which the flexibility of
commanders to take action to save lives was severely curtailed. Jack Lavelle believed that there was an immediate
North Vietnamese threat to Americans under his command, and he believed that he had tacit approval to respond
to that threat. There was substantial evidence that the threat was real, but no evidence other than Lavelle's
statement that he had approval to neutralize the threat.
Gen. John Lavelle may have made mistakes, but these were made in the interest of saying American lives in a
hopeless war in which Americans were constrained by arbitrary rules while fighting an enemy that knew no rules. In
history's judgment, his mistakes will seem small when measured against the intellectual mistakes of a civilian
leadership, which committed this nation to a catastrophic course and lacked the wisdom to change that course.
Jack Lavelle wrote no books, made no speeches, bore no animosity toward a country and an Air Force he loved.
He was a professional military man who served his country with a distinction not described in his obituaries.",8,Support,,,,,,,54,96,1979,0.596024801,0.589498553,20.1513,24.25353
"Taylor, Maxwell",1964,1,1979-08-17,0,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,SALT II: The Numbers Fallacy,"Thus, it is clear that US forces, to match Soviet destructive capabilities, would need a considerable superiority in numbers of weapons to compensate for these disadvantages…accordingly, parity based on numbers alone is revealed as a dangerous fallacy, one which entails serious consequences. ","In the course of forming an opinion of the merits of SALT II, I have been impressed by the damage to its case
resulting from a fallacious assumption. It is that parity in strategic forces can be achieved through rough
equivalence of numbers of strategic weapons, or, more accurately, strategic launchers. If it can be shown that this
assumption is incorrect and that equality in numbers does not assure ""equivalent overall military capabilities"" -- a
requirement set by the administration for an acceptable arms-control agreement -- the case for SALT is in serious
trouble.
A mere count of strategic weapons is wholly inadequate to measure the relative effectivenss of opposing forces.
The only military capability possessed by such weapons is the ability to destroy hostile target on order, and hence,
the only meaningful measure of their value is their target destruction potential. The latter derives not only from
numbers of weapons but also from such things as the accuracy, reliability and throwweight of weapons, their
survivability under attack and the number and nature of the targets they must destroy.
Analytic studies of the relative losses that would be suffered by U.S. and Soviet forces in a major strategic
exchange usually indicate that the U.S. side would be at a serious disadvantage. This is because we must assume
that a nuclear exchange would be initiated by a Soviet first strike, probably directed at our exposed ICBMs. In this
case, we would have to expect to lose a large part of these weapons, perhaps up to 80 percent or more at the
height of the Soviet destructive capabilities in the 1980s. Moreover, if we wished to retaliate against their unfired
ICBMs, we would be uncertain which missiles had been launched and which remained in silos ready for a second
salvo. To do maximum damage to the remainder, we would have to fire upon all known silos and, in so doing,
waste many American weapons on empty holes.
Similarly, if our retaliation extended to urban-industrial targets, we would need to expend many more weapons than
the Soviets to achieve equivalent damage on similar targets. This is because the larger number and greater
dispersion of such targets in the Soviet Union and the better protection afforded them by Soviet air and civil defense
measures.
Thus, it is clear that U.S. forces, to match Soviet destructive capabilities, would need a considerable superiority in
numbers of weapons to compensate for these disadvantages. Since SALT II obviously contains no such
compensations, it cannot rightfull claim to establish essential equivalence in the preeminent measure of strategic
power: target destruction potential. Accordingly, parity based on numbers alone is revealed as a dangerous fallacy,
one which entails serious consequences.
Since the treaty purports to establish parity in military capabilities yet does not, its ratification would mislead our
country and its allies as to the true balance of forces resulting from it -- a misapprehension unlikely to be shared by
Soviet leaders, who are openly delighted with its text in the present form.

SALT II: The Numbers Fallacy
Further, ratification would validate and perpetuate the numbers fallacy for all future arms control treaties since we
would find it hard to reject at a later date or to persuade the Soviets to abandon a standard that they must perceive
as advantageous.
Finally, since our government following ratification would be expected henceforth to follow a military policy
consistent with the treaty, in logic our strategic programs would be designed to catch up and keep up with our
Soviet rivals in the strategic field in every way permitted by its terms. We could expect such programs to include
not only an MX missile to match the best of the Soviet ICBMs but also probably a new bomber to offset the Backfire
along with plans for expanded air and civil defense. All this would cost a great deal of money that, in times of
economic stringency like the present, would be raised largely at the expense of our under-strength non-nuclear
forces. The result could be a serious imbalance of force structure to the detriment of highly important tasks
involving the support of allies, the protection of sea lanes and the assurance of access and undisturbed trade with
essential overseas sources of oil and other important raw materials.
Such are a few of the possible consequences of the numbers fallacy. As long as it is the accepted formula for
determining military needs in the strategic field, we shall be condemned to a mindless numbers race whether or not
SALT is ratified. Only if we insist on basing our weapons requirements on the need to perform tasks of
unchallenged importance to our security -- in most cases the destruction of certain designated target systems -- can
we know with reasonable certainty what and how many weapons we really need either for deterrence or for
retaliation. As an added plus, a strategic policy so conceived would not depend on numbers decisions made in
Moscow.
Does the numbers fallacy with its consequences constitute a fatal weakness for SALT, one justifying its rejection?
Probably not, if the administration can translate the numbers of weapons permitted by the treaty into terms of
destruction potential and then produce convincing evidence of the adequacy of the latter against all majro Soviet
target systems under all likely conditions. I suspect that the adequacy probably exists, but the Senate and the
public are surely entitled to the evidence.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,54,96,1979,0.596024801,0.589498553,20.1513,24.25353
"Westmoreland, William",1972,1,1979-09-22,0,0,0,NYT,Army,,,M,"Reject SALT, but Seek Genuine Nuclear Disarmament",Americans should be concerned about what action the Government will take to offset the Soviet Union's large-scale military build up in both nuclear and conventional forces. ,"Americans should be concerned about what action the Government will take to offset the Soviet Union's large‐scale military buildup in both nuclear and conventional forces. As I observe the SALT process, I conclude that the odds of providing for an adequate defense and encouraging international stability would be enhanced by rejection of SALT II and its protocol. At the same time, I suggest that we accelerate efforts toward achieving genuine nuclear disarmament. It is not the exclusion of the Soviet Backfire bomber or the problems of compliance verification that concern me. Nor am I deeply disturbed by some inequity in numbers. I am concerned about the principle that the Russians be allowed 308 SS‐18 heavymissile launchers as we are prohibited from developing a similar capability.. But my major concern is the restraint imposed by the treaty and particularly the protocol on the exploitation of our technology — an area where we have been pre‐eminent. Restraints on technology force us to follow a pattern that will probably not be the most economical way to provide a deterrent to nuclear war. Without the restrictions of the treaty and its protocol, a more effective and probably less‐expensive system could be developed by the use of the now‐restrained cruise‐missile technology, the development of mobile land‐based missiles, and the deployment of more launchers at sea. Future Federal budgets will be strained because of the energy crisis, likely persistent inflation, and the rising cost of our “welfare state.” So, inevitably, military budgets will be under extreme pressure. Therefore, a national strategy must be developed that will provide adequately for our defense and be prepared to protect our global interest at lowest cost. The current treaty will not satisfy that requirement. I doubt that our political system will have the wisdom and courage to resist the temptation to substitute SALT II for the cost of providing an adequate defense posture. Our political democracy will be more prone to react positively to global realities if not constrained by an agreement that is more cosmetic than constructive. Specifically, if SALT II is ratified, there will be, and should be, political pressures to go to the limit of the agreement. However, that may not provide a military capability consistent with the several threats to our future national well‐being. Thus, we could be competing in an arms race within boundaries controlled in considerable degree by an adversary. Full flexibility of action will be denied us. In this connection, the SALT process has admirably served the psychological programs of the Soviet Union by giving dramatic visibility worldwide to its military might. It should be obvious that there are military threats to our national interest that are more likely than nuclear war. There are large and well‐armed forces of the Warsaw Pact threatening the security of Western Europe and our interests there. Our most vulnerable area in the long run is the growing problem of raw materials to stoke our industrial society. Hence, the arena of potential conflict is global and the means of dealing with it involves conventional military forces — land, sea and air — coupled with skillful diplomatic action. The threat to our economic life is far more real than the threat of nuclear war or an attack against Western Europe; it is inevitable. SALT II establishes an overriding priority to forces that could have little influence on Soviet initiatives in areas of traditional interest to us. (Witness the most recent disclosure of Soviet troops in Cuba.) Therefore, in funding programs to reduce the risks of nuclear war, we must not neglect those forces that can influence a threat to our eco nomic well‐being forces that are flexible in their use and become visible to both friend and foe. An element of Soviet strategy, it seems, is to divert us from attending to that area. Before we can safely disarm, we must rearm. Before we dare negotiate further with the Soviet Union, we must put ourselves in a stronger military. Meanwhile, the Senate should reject SALT II and its protocol with a mandate to the Administration to reopen talks designed genuinely to reduce nuclear weapons on an equitable basis. Such an overture could not credibly stamp us war‐mongers. If the Soviet Union truly wants to decrease the possibility of nuclear war, it will accept such a proposal. If not, indeed its Government is to be viewed with even greater suspicion. Concurrently, the Senate should commit itself to sponsoring military programs focused on the several threats facing our nation. Finally, the Senate should set up a watchdog committee to monitor our military capability and report each year to the Administration and the public. Soviet leaders are using the bargaining table as a weapon against us. They have been playing games with our political democracy — and winning. Myopic, vote‐begging politicians have created for us a perplexing security problem. Only far‐sighted statesmen who put the national interest above all else can right the situation.

"Turner, Stansfield",1978,1,1981-09-15,0,0,0,NYT,Navy,,,M,Why Stop at a Triad?,"The argument that the United States must preserve its triad of strategic nuclear forces is bogus. It is bogus because it only concerns what weapons we possess, not what they must achieve. The real issues are, what is the objective of the triad, and does it take  a mix of three strategic weapons systems to achieve it?","The argument that the United States must preserve its triad of strategic nuclear forces is bogus. It is bogus because it only concerns what weapons we possess, not what they must achieve. The real issues are, What is the objective of the triad, and does it take a mix of three strategic-weapons systems to achieve it? How about two? Or maybe four?

The objective is to ensure that if one element of our strategic nuclear forces were made vulnerable, the others would be so able to retaliate that any enemy would be deterred from attacking.

The wisdom of having several strategic nuclear systems to back each other up is very evident. In fact, one of our three systems, the land-based Minuteman missile, today is theoretically vulnerable to a surprise attack. Although that vulnerability currently is being debated, it appears that the Soviet Union has so improved the accuracy of its numerous and large land-based missiles that conceivably they could knock out most of our Minutemen in a single, large-scale attack.

Some people are questioning whether this accuracy would actually prevail in combat. Regardless of whether it will or not, there is an aura of uncertainty about whether our land-based-missile forces are adequately secure. This means that the credibility of that leg of the triad is eroding.

It is fortunate that we have strategic bombers and strategic submarines to back up this weakening leg, but what if a counter should be developed to one or both of these alternatives?

The United States could be exposed to nuclear blackmail. However, the argument that because of such a possibility we should retain the land-based-missile leg of the triad defies logic.

How could an already vulnerable system make up for possible future vulnerabilities of bomber and submarine systems? Certainly more Minutemen would not be a useful backup for our bombers and submarines. The MX missile would be useful only if it is likely to be more survivable than either of these other systems in the future. Is that likely to be the case?

When the MX system was designed, it had 200 missiles scattered among 4,600 shelters. Some proponents of the MX contended that with that many points to aim at, it would not be vulnerable. I believe that was wishful thinking from the beginning. It certainly is today when the current estimate is that all the Administration will approve is 100 missiles in 1,000 shelters.

If the Soviet Union has the capability to knock out our 1,000 Minutemen this year or in 1982, surely by the time we could deploy the MX the Russians could also knock out an additional 1,000 shelters.

Thus, the public should be alert to the cry of ''preserve the triad'' as a justification for perpetuating the most obsolete part of the triad in the form of the MX.

Instead, let us remind ourselves of the basic objective: to retain an invul nerab le deterrent. If we don't feel as comfortable as we'd like with jus t bombers and submarines - and I don't - can we find something els e?

Yes. We can rebuild the triad with cruise missiles: on land-based mobile launchers, on surface ships, and in attack submarines, as well as in aircraft, as currently planned.

But why stop at a triad? We could also shrink the MX to a size that could be transported on a road, and thus have four legs rather than three.

Whether we need this fourth alternative is a function of the sense of assurance it gives us as measured against its cost. It can probably wait until we see whether the vulnerability of the other systems increases.

The point is, yes, we probably need at least a triad, but that is not synonomous with preserving a land-based-missile system that, in the form of either the Minuteman or MX, is too vulnerable to provide assurance that our defensive posture is sound.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,50,97,1981,0.606865095,0.609582126,26.21428,24.9629
"Turner, Stansfield",1978,1,1981-12-02,0,0,0,NYT,Navy,,,M,The Zero Option,"In sum, President Reagan's proposal has merit but also risk. For it to work, we must hold to it and press our advantage no matter how loudly the Soviet Union screams or our allies urge compromise. ","President Reagan's announced ''zero option'' objective in the arms talks with the Soviet Union in
Geneva would, if realized, benefit the West, but it also would carry serious risks.
To comply in the negotiations on reducing theater weapons in Europe, which began Monday, the Russians would
have to dismantle three types of already deployed ballistic missiles -the SS-20, the SS-5, and the SS-4 - perhaps
600 in all. In exchange, the United States would cancel plans to deploy 572 new medium-range missiles in
Europe - Pershing 2's and cruise missiles.
One benefit would be to relieve our European allies of their fright caused by the build-up of nuclear weapons
threatening their territories. But this is a short-term benefit because the Europeans will soon realize that it is
largely illusory. Europe could also be hit by Soviet intercontinental-range ballistic missiles, shorterrange missiles
based in Eastern Europe, and bombers.
A more significant benefit from the successful reduction in tactical nuclear arsenals would be the impetus that it
might provide to seek a more comprehensive agreement to control all nuclear weapons.
But successful negotiation of the Reagan dismantling-andcancellation proposal - that is, the ''zero option'' - would
confer important advantages upon the Soviet Union.
America would be giving up a significant geographic advantage. Soviet theater nuclear weapons pose no physical
threat to the United States, yet any American ballistic missile in Europe threatens not just Soviet forces on a
battlefield on the Continent but also the heart of the Soviet Union's strategic forces: the large, land-based missiles
pointed at the United States. If agreement is not reached on the zero option, the Russians' strategic force will be
vulnerable and ours will not. Consequently, they badly want to negotiate away our geographic advantage.
Another problem is that the zero option would eliminate the United States' land-based cruise missiles in Europe at
a time when our dependence on such missiles is increasing.
In SALT II, we resisted Moscow's efforts to limit cruise missiles because we were - and still are - well ahead in this
technology, and because the cruise missile fits well into the land, sea, and air legs of our strategic nuclear triad.
This fit becomes more important as our confidence in the triad's ability to survive an attack erodes.
President Reagan's recent decision to deploy only half as many B-1 bombers and land-based MX missiles as
originally planned reflects an understanding that large, land-based missiles and manned bombers that can
penetrate Soviet airspace (except perhaps for the so-called Stealth bomber in a decade or so) have had their day.
While we still believe that the Soviet Union cannot find and hit our strategic-missile submarines, we cannot risk
relying on any single leg of the triad.
Consequently, the most significant part of Mr. Reagan's decision was to put cruise missiles into regular
submarines. This signaled not an increased reliance on submarines but a turning to the cruise missile to bolster
the sagging triad.
Cruise missiles can also be placed on land launchers in Europe, as currently planned, or on aircraft, on ships, and
on the soil of the 50 states.
Page 5 of 24 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
An agreement that eliminates land-based launchers in Europe forecloses only one cruise-missile option, but
unless we are careful it could also dangerously narrow our freedom to use this best substitute for the two dying
elements of the triad.
Therefore, we had better understand the benefits to be gained now and where we will hold the line on further
restrictions on cruise missiles.
We must also ensure that the zero option does not rule out nonnuclear cruise missiles, because we need them
more than the Soviet Union does.
Our military power is built around the use of tactical aircraft. Soviet superiority in tanks and artillery has always
been somewhat offset by our greater accuracy in bombing. But advances in Soviet weaponry are making such
use of aircraft very risky. Again, the best substitute is the cruise missile.
The principal missile the Russians would forsake, the SS-20, is small and mobile - it is about the size of a fire
department's hookand-ladder truck. Photographic verification techniques cannot ensure that it is not being hidden
in barns or caves. Thus, it is reasonable to demand on-site inspection, which, in any event, would be essential to
progress on all sorts of future arms-control agreements.
Finally, for verification purposes we must hold out for an all-ornothing elimination of the SS-20's, SS-5's, and
SS-4's. So long as retention of some of these missiles is authorized, we cannot confidently know exactly how
many are deployed. But the chance of uncovering a surreptitious deployment goes up markedly when none is
authorized. Then, the spotting of even one is evidence of a violation.
In sum, President Reagan's proposal has merit but also risk. For it to work, we must hold to it and press our
advantage no matter how loudly the Soviet Union screams or our allies urge compromise. Anything less would
not compensate for the longer-term disadvantages to this vital area of our national security.

","Having long and openly lamented the absence of a rational military policy, I am occasionally asked what such a
policy would be like and what it might be expected to accomplish. The purpose of this article is to answer these
questions.
The dominant characteristic of the policy I have in mind is task-orientation--that is, it would specify the strategic
tasks that the Armed Forces should be able to perform and cause these forces to be designed accordingly.
Expanded into a definition, a task-oriented policy is one that generates and maintains forces adequate to carry out
the strategic tasks made necessary by urgent threats to important national interests.
To be urgent, such a threat must have a high probability of occurrence and a high damage potential if it occurs. A
national interest in this context may be an asset, goal, advantage or source of power for the attainment or protection
of which the government is willing to expand substantial resources and risk the consequences of failure.
Obviously, the formulation of such a policy would entail extremely difficult judgments and decisions on the part of
the responsible officials. The most demanding would include the identification of the interests requiring military
protection, the threats that might endanger these interests, the tasks that would fall to the Armed Forces, and the
size, organization, equipment and readiness of forces requisite for the tasks.
Even if the right decisions were taken on these points and a task-oriented policy formulated, there would remain the
problem of convincing Congress of its merits. In the case of the defense budget, Pentagon spokesmen would need
to explain the rationale behind its formulation and show how the big-money items and programs would contribute to
the success of one or more of the strategic tasks assigned to the Armed Forces. They must also make clear how
the new weapons systems all passed the test of essentiality--that is, they not only contributed substantially to a
strategic task but did so at a tolerable cost and excelled in quality all competitive weapon systems.
What advantages would such a rational, task-oriented policy offer? For the first time in history, we would have a
military policy designed specifically to satisfy the military needs of approved foreign policy. The policy designers
would have taken into account many more threats than those attributable to the Soviet Union and possible theaters
of operations beyond the familiar ones in Western Europe.
Such an expanded survey, reinforced by the lessons afforded by our current experience in Central America, should
lead to a better appreciation of our growing interests in Third World countries, particularly those that are or promise
to become important trading partners needed to provide our economy with essential raw materials. It should also
make for a better understanding of the malignant consequences of excessive population growth in these
undeveloped countries, especially those that will double their population in two to three decades. The resultant
Page 2 of 3
Make the Arms Fit the Task
chaotic conditions would not only interrupt our trade but would further roil the troubled waters, inviting Soviet
fishermen to throw in their line.
Another way to appreciate the advantages of a task-oriented policy is to consider past governmental errors which,
under the new policy, would probably be avoided. For example:
* There would be no further justification for an arms race with the Soviets, if one ever existed. In cases where Soviet
armed forces, nuclear or conventional, threatened an important national interest, there would be one or more task
forces maintained in readiness to counter the danger. Unless reinforced by strong allies, we would make no effort, I
hope, to match Soviet military might in regions close to the Soviet periphery. Our national planners could hardly
forget the price Khrushchev paid for his mistake in putting offensive missiles in Cuba on our very doorstep.
* By the same token, we would expect no repetition of the Carter Doctrine blunder, when, without discussion with
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the president proclaimed an intention to resist, by military means if necessary, any thirdparty
intervention in the region of the Persian Gulf. Under our new policy, it is unlikely that there would be an official
statement on the subject unless or until we had a task force in being that would at least symbolize impressively our
intention to preserve our access to Middle East oil. But the region would remain too far away to permit a major
commitment on our part.
* The MX issue would never have taken its present form. The weapon system could not have passed the
essentiality test because (a) the ""window of vulnerability"" has not been proved an urgent threat; (b) the missile
would add little if anything to the survivability or deterrent effectiveness of our strategic forces; and (c) there are
competitive alternatives, notably submarine-launched and cruise missiles, that justify further consideration.
* Many costly service programs would probably come a cropper. The Air Force would have difficulty in proving the
continued relevance of the ""triad"" dogma. The Navy would have difficulty demonstrating that there are essential
tasks that require two additional supercarriers to fulfill. The Army and Marines would have trouble defending the
maintenance of ready divisions for which there is insufficient sea and air transport to convey them to an overseas
theater of operations in time and no existent supply system to main tain them in action once there.
Even if the advantages to expect from a task-oriented policy are conceded, what chance is there of its adoption?
Shortly after the end of the fighting in Korea, a prominent official asked Gen. George Marshall whether it would be
naive to believe that the American people had learned a great deal from the war. Marshall's reply was immediate.
""No, not naive--incredibly naive.""
But one may hope without necessarily being naive. It is true that a proposal to adopt this kind of task-oriented
military policy would encounter opposition from many sources--Pentagon bureaucrats, service interest partisans,
congressional committees fearing for their turf and defense in dustries fearing for their contracts. But hard times are
ahead when enormous federal deficits will force deep cuts in all federal budgets, military and civilian. If they are to
be carried out with minimum damage to genuine national interests, such cuts must begin by eliminating the items
with the least claim to essentiality.
In the case of the military budget, I know of no better way to forestall the lean years ahead than by adopting a taskoriented
policy and budget. Furthermore, the change could be initiated without delay if the appropriate committees
of Congress would henceforth greet all Pentagon officials arriving to defend their budget with a single question, ""If
funded, how will your project contribute to the strategic tasks that the Armed Forces must be ready and able to
perform?""",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,53,98,1983,0.627395232,0.608435178,25.87627,31.70853

how far the Geneva talks have come and what is in store.
Moscow, which has not yet agreed to a date for resumption of the talks, said in December it needed more time to
reassess the situation in view of the deployments of American intermediate-range missiles in Europe.
In the negotiations, which began in June 1982, America's opening proposal called for deep reductions in ballistic
missile warheads, to a level of 5,000 on each side. The Soviet proposal continues to place primary emphasis on
limiting the numbers of missiles and bombers, to 1,800 on both sides. But, on a positive note, Moscow has agreed
that limiting launchers alone is not sufficient, and has proposed that we limit nuclear weapons as well. Both sides
have not, however, reached agreement on which weapons to include in any accord.

and USSR; says both sides have responded to other's concerns, and groundwork has been laid for real progress;
rejects idea of offering new concessions to bring Soviet Union back to negotiating table, or of combining these talks
with those on intermediate range missiles; drawing (M)
In the early rounds, both delegations set forth their own proposals and asked questions of each other. This brought
out the differences clearly. Beginning in the summer of 1983, the United States introduced changes in its proposal
that were designed to respond to major Soviet concerns and to narrow the differences between the two countries'
positions.
The Soviet delegates initially com
plained that the ceiling we sought on the numbers of ballistic missiles was too low and would force a restructuring
of Soviet forces. We said we could raise that ceiling. They said that proposed constraints on their land-based
intercontinental ballistic missiles were too complex. We said we were prepared to explore alternative ways of
limiting the size and destructive power of these missiles. They said our original proposal would first place limits on
weapons of concern to us and only later would limit weapons of most concern to the Soviet Union. We changed our
position so that it was clear that all weapons could be considered at the same time - as President Reagan put it,
''Everything is on the table.'' Finally, the Soviet Union said our proposal to reduce the destructive power - usually
called throw-weight - of their ballistic missiles to that of the United States was too demanding and thus unrealistic.
We therefore said that we would ask only that an agreement result in a substantial reduction in the 3-to-1 disparity
between the throw-weights of the two missile forces.

GROUNDWORK FOR ARMS PROGRESS
For their part, the Soviet delegates acted in response to American concerns. They amended provisions of their
proposal that would have made it impossible for America to deploy its new generation of submarine- launched
ballistic missiles. Moreover, they said they would ease, under certain conditions, their proposed ban on long-range
air-launched cruise missiles. In the closing weeks of the last round, Moscow agreed to our longstanding offer to
establish a working group to negotiate measures to build confidence between the two nations, such as advance
warning of nuclear missile tests and major military exercises.
In the round that ended in December, we introduced a concept - the ''build-down'' - designed to enhance strategic
stability. This concept, which enjoys strong bipartisan Congressional support, calls for reductions that would
contribute to greater stability. Each nation would be required to scrap a certain number of existing warheads for
every new warhead introduced, and scrap more existing ones if the new ones were of a more-destabilizing nature.
Under the build-down, both sides would be required to reduce their warheads by a minimum percentage each year.
To get the Kremlin to discuss how to narrow the differences between us, now that negotiations had progressed
sufficiently to warrant such a move, America offered to explore ways of trading off Soviet and American
advantages. This could entail, for example, our agreeing to limit the number of our air-launched cruise missiles in
return for Soviet agreement to limit the numbers of its warheads on I.C.B.M.'s - each side thus trading reductions in
an area of its advantage for reductions in an area of advantage on the other side. The Soviet delegation did not
respond, probably because it did not know the direction its reassessment would take it.
In sum, there has been real progress to date. Both sides have responded, in varying degrees, to the other's
concerns. And we have offered to explore trading areas of respective interest and advantages to narrow our
differences. We do not see that folding issues from the suspended intermediate-range-missile talks into the
strategic arms talks would, as some suggest, ease the way, but we will study any reasonable proposal made by
Moscow.
What next? The groundwork has been laid for real progress. But, as Secretary of State George P. Shultz has
stressed, it would be wrong to offer new concessions to bring the Soviet Union back to the negotiating table,
especially in view of our offer to explore trade-offs. A return to negotiating is the best way to make progress toward
an agreement that reduces strategic offensive arms and thus reduces the risk of nuclear war. We're ready. It's up to

"Lemnitzer, Lyman",1969,1,1984-06-19,0,1,0,NYT,Army,,,M,Retain the Joint Chiefs,"The existing system is sound. It would be a serious error to adopt proposed legislative changes in the presently assigned functions, duties, and responsibilities of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","Congress is considering a basic and far-reaching change in the carefully balanced Joint Chiefs of Staff system. The
proposals would significantly revise the duties, responsibilities and functions within the system and move them
toward the concept of a single chief of staff. Such a step would be unwise.
As a former member and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, former Chief of Staff of the Army and commander of United
States forces in Europe and the Far East, I have had considerable experience within the Joint Chiefs system.
Today, it is working well - better than at any time in its history. It is significant that Gen. John Vessey, an
outstanding Chairman who is serving a second tour of duty in his post, and the other current members of the Joint
Chiefs have testified in support of the existing system.
History demonstrates that one of the greatest challenges to any constitutional democracy is maintenance of civilian
control over national defense decisions while also insuring an efficient, effective military apparatus. America is
fortunate in that such a balance was struck with the organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The architects of the
joint chiefs system in America and Britain were Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.
The Joint Chiefs system has served the nation well for more than 40 years in war and so-called peace. It has
evolved to keep pace with the technical revolution in arms, but it has remained true to its primary responsibility: to
provide the President, Defense Secretary and other civilian leaders with the best possible consensus of
professional military advice, reflecting the views and capabilities of all the military services.
Critics make much of disagreements in the military leadership and of alleged inordinate delays in decision-making.
They make much of Britain's 1982 move to abandon its joint chiefs in favor of a more concentrated military
authority. I do not consider that decision relevant. Britain's global responsibilities have been drastically shrunk by
postwar realities that account for the revision.
During my association with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, there were countless proposals for modifying its organizational
structure and activities to eliminate disagreements and to expedite decisions. I do not know of any major civilian
activity involving such complex problems in which agreement is always unanimous; while this is taken for granted in
other fields, critics seem to find it inexcusable in the military. Their arguments stem mainly from the position that
when the Joint Chiefs do not unanimously agree on an issue, they have abandoned their responsibilities to the
Secretary of Defense, where an issue must go for final decision. This view holds that only by creating a more
powerful chairman - in reality, a single chief of staff - could we achieve the military agreement necessary for
authoritative military decisions and forceful military action. I do not agree. While I was Chairman, the Joint Chiefs
reached agreement on better than 99 percent of the host of questions coming before us. When there are
disagreements - often involving fundamental problems - the Joint Chiefs provide an essential service to the Defense
Secretary and the President. In such cases, alternate proposals are prepared. The advantages and disadvantages
of each course are fully documented by military officers of the respective services and Joint Staff before being
presented by the Joint Chiefs to the Secretary and President. The best way to give civilian leaders balanced
military advice is by using the talents and broad experience of the military chiefs of all services: Each knows his
own service; each is an expert in his field. Our present organization provides the checks and balances that
moderate extreme views. Some criticize this system as unwieldy. I do not. It is uniquely suited to American
democracy. One potentially irreconcilable problem during my tenure as Chairman involved an ''Overall Target
Assignment Plan.'' After considerable debate, there remained disagreements on 20 issues. With the approval of
Defense Secretary Thomas S. Gates Jr., I assembled the Joint Chiefs and the top combatant commanders at the
heaquarters of the Strategic Air Command in Nebraska. After two days of intensive discussion, agreement was
reached on all but three points. I notified Secretary Gates and suggested that he join us. The Joint Chiefs and
combatant commanders presented their respective views on each issue, and after careful consideration he
rendered his decisions. All agreed that they could accept and support those decisions, which were later approved
by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. That is how the Joint Chiefs of Staff system can and should operate. The
existing system is sound. It would be a serious error to adopt proposed legislative changes in the presently
assigned functions, duties and responsibilities of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",10,CivMilBalance,1,,,,,Authors assert legislative changes should not be made to the JCS.,53,98,1983,0.627395232,0.608435178,25.87627,31.70853

","WASHINGTON -- It is no secret that the Sandinista Government is unpopular in this capital. The Administration is
united in its conviction that the Sandinistas must go: the only issue is how and when.
President Reagan has two choices: either direct United States military intervention or a longer-term program of
political and economic pressures designed to wear down the Sandinista leadership. Mr. Reagan may choose the
second course. Of great concern to those of us who consider
direct military intervention unwise and harmful to long-term United States interests in Latin America are factors
that may dispose the President to early military action. For military and political reasons, the period between now
and the opening of the new Congress would be ideal for introducing forces into Nicaragua. Everything is in place:
plans made, troops trained. All President Reagan has to do is issue the order and our forces would move.
Notification of Congress could be delayed because Congress won't be in session until mid-January and won't be
organized for business until mid-February. Two years of exercises in Central America have adequately
familiarized the services with the terrain and waters offshore. Our forces would enter Nicaragua in an
orchestrated maneuver from sea, land and air. In a matter of days, or at most several weeks, Managua would be
''secured'' and all forms of communication - radio, telephone, telegraph, television, newspapers - would be in the
hands of the United States military commander. Highways, roads, airfields and water transport would be blocked.
It would be a relatively simple operation, partly because Nicaragua is in a peculiar geographical position that
makes it nearly indefensible against large-scale attack. United States naval and marine forces could land and
walk ashore on the Caribbean and Pacific sides. Army troops from the 82d Airborne could fly from bases in the
United States to Nicaragua and parachute into Managua. Meanwhile, our soldiers and United States-backed
rebels could march into Nicaragua from Honduras in the north and Costa Rica in the south. Logistical support
from the seven airfields the United States has built just north, in Honduras, would fuel, feed and arm our troops
with relative ease. Recently installed radar could control air attacks against fixed ground positions and help
eliminate pockets of resistance. After Managua was secured, there would be little the surviving Sandinistas could
do to mount effective counterattacks. They would assuredly continue guerrilla operations in Nicaragua and nearby
countries for years, but they would have great difficulty acquiring the munitions necessary to wage more than
sporadic attacks against our forces. No one really knows how many casualties would occur, but military
commanders make estimates before taking action. The Center for Defense Information estimates that 500 to
1,000 Americans would be killed. Nicaraguan military men and civilians killed would depend upon how quickly the
country capitulated.
The Soviet Union could be ignored, as it is incapable of assisting the Nicaraguans, in our backyard, as we were
incapable of helping the Afghans when the Soviet Union invaded their country. Fidel Castro would make strong
statements about intervention but has no resources to throw into a fray.
Such are the factors arguing for early military action. But what of the argument against invasion?
Many American would see a large- scale invasion as politically counterproductive and bordering on insanity. It
could end up making more Communists than it killed, and it would once again make a mockery of America's
commitment to the principle of self- determination for all nations. We would have to commit thousands, if not tens
of thousands, of troops as an occupation force for an indefinite number of years. In time, the public and Congress
would sour on the whole enterprise and on Mr. Reagan.

But as the historian Barbara Tuchman reminds us, governments do strange things. The recent round of scares
and warnings involving Soviet MIG's in Nicaragua appears to have faded, but it tells us how volatile the
Nicaraguan issue is and how simple it would be to manufacture a pretext for military intervention.

"Kennedy, William",,1,1985-02-11,0,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,"Listen to Some of Your Critics, Cap","The longer we delay a more rational defense program, the greater the danger that what the former treasury and commerce secretaries warned of in 1983 will come to pass…","Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger is once again performing yeoman service fighting for President Reagan's defense budget in front of congressional committees -- arenas that to him must seem to have turned into a den of snarling lions. But when Mr. Weinberger argues, as he has done for months, that the Soviets and only the Soviets can determine the level of U.S. defense spending, it is increasingly hard to work up much sympathy for him.

Early in 1983 six former secretaries of treasury and commerce -- all Republicans -- published full-page newspaper ads urging a cap on defense spending. ""Soviet spending,"" the secretaries stated, ""will, of course, affect the threat we face. But it does not tell us how much to spend to counter that threat. . . . Indispensable cuts in non-defense spending are not likely to be negotiated unless accompanied by reductions in the growth of defense spending.""

What they saw as ""likely"" in 1983 is fact today. Congress got actual outlays for fiscal 1985 down to $246.3 billion, but the administration wants a 13% increase to $277.5 billion for the next fiscal year. More ominous are the huge procurement expenditures within those current budgets, committing the country to greatly increased defense budgets in the future. It is that trend that has concerned both Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress and has led to a near-mutiny against the administration's defense program.

The Defense Department is a seriously troubled enterprise. It has deep structural flaws stemming largely from the fact that the several services are free to pursue their own goals and agendas, with an elaborate system of separate service staffs and academic institutions to support their rival and often contradictory ""national"" strategies. Much of this was obscured during President Reagan's first three years when each service was getting not only all the money it wanted, but more than any of them could manage efficiently.

The unending succession of spare-parts ""horror stories"" and of entire failed systems makes it plain that management controls have not kept pace with the rising expenditures. A case in point is the Army's Division Air Defense (DivAD) system, currently threatened with cancellation at a loss of some $1.2 billion. The Army's management of armored-vehicle development and procurement has been open to question for at least 20 years. One outrageously ""gold-plated"" tank development program has followed another. During the same period the West Germans produced a set of armored vehicles the equal or superior of anything in the U.S. inventory, and without a single major failure. Yet no one ever seems to ask: What are we doing wrong, and what are the Germans doing right?

The administration seems also to be oblivious to an intensifying interservice conflict as even relatively minor congressional budget cuts have begun to create internal budgetary pressures. At the center of these growing controversies is the Reagan 600-ship Navy, launched and ably defended since by Secretary of the Navy John Lehman. The Army became so alarmed over what it perceived to be the ""threat"" of the 600-ship Navy to its future programs that, in April 1982, it fired the entire civilian staff of its Strategic Studies Institute at Carlisle Barracks, Pa., for failure to protect the Army against what one of its senior aides described as the ""onslaught"" of the Reagan Navy.

Unless someone acts soon to take hold of the situation, the sort of bitter animosities generated by the panicky Army action will proliferate as the services seek to devour each other and as entities within each service compete for diminishing funds.

First, the 600-ship Navy and the ""maritime strategy"" from which it springs are incompatible with a continued massive U.S. troop presence in Europe -- the product of an opposite but much more poorly thought-out and articulated ""continental"" or ""balanced-forces"" strategy. If $200 billion deficits tell us anything, it is that we are living beyond our means in trying to sustain both of those massive, contradictory programs. The Europeans, already providing 90% of the NATO land forces in Europe, could make up for the diminished U.S. troop presence very quickly. They cannot produce a world-class Navy.

The cost of the U.S. NATO establishment is estimated at $165 billion a year by Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, and as ""about half"" of the annual U.S. defense budget by the Defense Department and the General Accounting Office. Much of that money is to maintain the equivalent of five U.S. Army divisions in Europe and a vast establishment for dependents. This represents some 100,000 of our 325,000 military personnel stationed there. Thus the withdrawal and deactivation of the divisions offer the means to achieve a large, short-term (two to three years) cut in the U.S. defense budget, close to the $30 billion to $40 billion needed to begin deficit control. Air Force squadrons, armored cavalry regiments and other units would remain.

There are other important opportunities for cost reduction:

Why are we supporting four war colleges in six locations when both Gen. George C. Marshall and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower intended that we come out of World War II with only one truly inter-service ""National War College""?

Why are we maintaining one set of administrative and logistic structures for a state-controlled National Guard and a duplicate set for the federally run Reserves? The decentralized state system long ago proved itself to be the more innovative and efficient of the two. The solution is simple, obvious and was proposed by the Defense Department as far back as 1965: Turn the units in all of the services over to the states and let the federal authorities manage the pools of individual reservists.

The Reserve Officers Association succeeded in blocking transfer of the federal units to National Guard control in 1965 largely because it found in then House Armed Services Committee Chairman Edward F. Hebert an ally who was looking for an issue on which he could successfully challenge then Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. Today, however, the leadership of the ROA is much less anti-National Guard than was the case in 1965, and Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), the current chairman, looks at things quite differently. With Defense Department cooperation, Rep. Aspin probably could implement such a reform provided effective action is taken to bar state political patronage from intruding into the National Guard.

Why are we maintaining a very expensive Airborne Corps and Airborne Division when there is no conceivable role in the American context for more than a two-battalion brigade of parachutists?

On the ground, lightly armed Airborne troopers simply cannot survive in a mechanized war in Europe except in defense of peripheral, low-priority positions. Flown to the Persian Gulf they would be dying of thirst in a matter of hours unless a massive airlift -- involving every transport aircraft now in the inventory or planned for the future and every aircraft in the mobilized Civil Reserve Air Fleet -- could get supplies to them without interference from the weather, accidents or enemy action.

Grenada and similar operations by Belgian and French paratroops over the past 20 years have demonstrated a continuing utility for small airborne operations -- never more than two battalions -- to seize undefended or lightly defended airfields in support of Third World police or rescue missions. Either the Army's new Ranger Regiment or a two-battalion brigade in the present Airborne establishment should be sufficient for such future need.

In last year's campaign even Walter Mondale was cowed into promising only to ""slow the growth"" of defense spending. Yet the deficiencies apparent in evaluation, testing and procurement, the contradictory strategies and the glaring areas of waste and inefficiency cited above -- by no means an exhaustive list -- suggest that the defense spending limits proposed by the former cabinet secretaries in 1983 are reasonable and attainable. In short, we should seek to ""freeze"" defense spending at the fiscal 1985 level.

The longer we delay a more rational defense program, the greater the danger that what the former treasury and commerce secretaries warned of in 1983 will come to pass: ""Relentless ad hoc tinkering with dollars and programs that will fatally sap the coherence and capabilities of our military forces for years to come.""

Secretary Weinberger announced soon after taking office in 1981 that he was returning national strategic planning to the military services. Every time in the past (such as in Imperial Germany) that the military has been handed such a key to a nation's treasury it has spent the country concerned into bankruptcy, and we may be in danger now of repeating that process. The time has come for Mr. Weinberger to start listening to long-time non-Pentagon supporters of a strong defense, such as Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), who have been warning for many months that our strategy far exceeds our fiscal grasp.",6,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,63,99,1985,0.643252854,0.619521671,26.15251,30.3494

","Let me ask you to take part in a decision-making exercise such as takes place in your government often. This theoretical problem will involve whether or not to take a risk that if successful will provide enormous benefits for the country, but which if unsuccessful and misunderstood could result, at a minimum, in great embarrassment and, more likely, in a considerable setback to U.S. relations with allies and to your relations with Congress. This kind of situation -- where the potential gain is very high but where information is incomplete and risks are high -- is not
uncommon in government. But let's get on with the scenario. It begins with the arrival in your office one day of a foreign diplomat who reports that a third government of great
strategic importance with whom you have no relations has expressed an interest in a dialogue to determine whether
or not common interests exist that may make possible a modus vivendi, a renewal of stable relations.
You are concerned, for this involves a country whose government has recently gone through a very violent
revolution in which the government killed literally hundreds of thousands of its own people and where there is no
certain basis for confidence that the people you might deal with carry real authority, or will deal in good faith, or will
be able to make good on their commitments.
Furthermore, it is a government that at this very moment is involved in supporting elements in third countries that
are engaged in killing Americans. And the diplomat urging you to do this also makes clear that there will
undoubtedly be a quid pro quo involved -- you will have to pay something for this, probably in the domain of security
assistance of some kind, for the country in question is locked in a strategic struggle with its neighbor. At the same
time, there is no question but that if such a dialogue were to develop and be kept clandestine for long enough to
identify a set of milestones for renewing stable relations, the strategic interests of the United States would benefit
enormously.
The question for you is: ""Would you agree to go to a first meeting as suggested by this foreign diplomat?""
It isn't too presumptuous to assert that most of the readers of this column, given the events of the past few days,
would cluck self-assuredly at this scenario and say, ""Of course not, what do you take me for?""
Of course the scenario isn't theoretical; it has happened, and the government decided to go ahead with the
clandestine contacts. The country was China, and today most people credit the secret diplomacy of Dr. Henry
Kissinger with giving us one of the most dramatic diplomatic triumphs ever achieved in our history.

As allied support grows for an accord to reduce medium- and short-range nuclear forces in Europe, I am
reminded of a brief conversation I had at the Reykjavik summit meeting with Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, chief
of staff of the Soviet armed forces.
''Why are you Americans so obsessed with nuclear weapons?'' he asked. ''We both know that conventional forces
are the cutting edge.''
The remark underscored a point that the Soviet leadership has understood for a long time and that we seem to
have trouble comprehending: If a nation considers force or the threat of force necessary to secure a political gain,
then conventional forces will be crucial in carrying out that policy.
That is why the Russians continue to invest the time, money and human resources necessary to maintain their
huge conventional forces. That is why they strive to maintain or increase their more than 2 to 1 advantage in
battle tanks and in artillery, and their 1.3 to 1 advantage in combat aircraft, which complement an immense and
sophisticated air defense system.
The Russians believe that this awesome assembly of force constitutes not only the best means to insure that their
Eastern European satellites follow the correct path of ''socialist development'' but also the best way to intimidate
their opponents. The Russians have forced a difficult choice on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
America's allies and friends around the globe. Western democracies are loath to spend the money and devote the
human resources that would be required for a conventional deterrent to a Soviet conventional attack.
We have no interest in making Europe ''safe'' for conventional war. In the 1950's, we made a deliberate choice:
We would rely on nuclear weapons as the great equalizer against the threat of Soviet conventional superiority.
The relationship between the danger of conventional war and the need for a credible nuclear deterrent is obvious.
We must maintain a nuclear deterrent as long as the Soviet Union has nuclear forces capable of striking our allies
and as long as it insists on perpetuating an imbalance in conventional forces.
Equally obvious is that nuclear weapons are not a panacea for ridding the world of international armed conflict.
Though we could build a ''doomsday machine,'' we would be fools to do so. And to the degree we choose not to
depend on nuclear weapons for deterrence, we must realize the importance of having effective conventional
forces.
In order to redress the imbalance of conventional forces, we must improve our own conventional force capabilities
and work to eliminate the imbalance through negotiation. If ''we arm to parley,'' as Winston Churchill once
advised, we could achieve both ends.
NATO already has under way a program of conventional defense improvements. This effort needs more attention
and support. In my view, the West should exploit its advantages in high technology and manufacturing to gain
leverage against the prolific Soviet weapons industry.

We should also continue to negotiate to enhance conventional stability by eliminating regional disparities and the
Soviet capability for surprise attack. Representatives of NATO and Warsaw Pact countries are holding informal
discussions to plan for future talks on this issue.
But we should not put all of our faith in negotiations alone. Conventional force negotiations are complicated, and
verification of any agreement would be tricky. In the 14-year history of the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions
talks, the Soviet Union has shown no interest in yielding its advantages. Indeed, it argues that a conventional
balance exists, though it consistently refuses to exchange data on its forces to back up this assertion. So talk is
not enough.
The Russians are right. Conventional forces are the key to their political strength, as they have shown in
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Afghanistan, to name only a few of their armed adventures. Before Moscow uses
its conventional force advantage for new incursions, we should take steps to end this serious imbalance.",9,Warfighting,,,,,,,61,100,1987,0.644682247,0.608146245,25.33944,29.58162
"McFarlane, Robert",,0,1987-06-23,1,0,0,NYT,Marine Corps ,,,M,Give Top Billing to Strategic Arms,The Russians read our headlines reporting Congressional misgivings over the defense budget. And while the Russians need a lot of Western help in the way of credits….surely we are not so naïve as to give them both the answers to their problems and cuts in our own defense budget without getting anything in return. ,"Advocates and critics of America's current position in the talks on medium-range missiles have pretty well set out
their arguments. Curiously, a more fundamental question - ''Why are we so preoccupied with intermediate-range
nuclear forces in the first place'' -hasn't even been asked.
For decades, America and the Soviet Union have focused their arms-control talks on the central strategic systems -
intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and bombers. These weapons, if allowed to
become significantly out of balance, could lead to disaster through miscalculation.
Why then have we now decided to emphasize an agreement on medium-range systems, which are less important
to our security interests?
A candid answer from the Administration might be: ''Because we want some kind of arms control agreement and
I.N.F. is the only area the Russians will talk about in terms acceptable to us - this is, without restricting strategic
defenses.''
This argument is open to rebuttal. But more important, are we sure the Soviet Union won't talk seriously about
strategic arms while accepting the inevitability that both sides must maintain healthy strategic defenses?
While it's probably fair to say that the Soviet leaders would rather see our S.D.I. program scuttled, by now they must
surely recognize that their own defense program provides sufficient justification to a bipartisan majority of the
Congress to assure a healthy investment in S.D.I. on our side, albeit at a lesser level than President Reagan might
like.
In short, our S.D.I. program is here to stay. Since that is true, then the fallback Soviet interest is to keep it as small
as possible.
In shaping their strategy for doing that, the Russians should take their cue from the signals the Administration has
been sending. For example, the President and the Secretaries of State and Defense have each said that the
character of the American program depends upon the size and character of the offense it must deal with.
If we must cope with the current Soviet force level, perhaps augmented ultimately by hundreds of additional, mobile
ICBM's, but don't deploy a mobile system of our own, we will need a very large program, indeed, including spacebased
and ground-based systems.
If, however, we succeed in reaching agreement to reduce the strategic forces on both sides below the level required
to threaten a disarming first strike, then perhaps we could envision a much more modest American S.D.I. program,
limited perhaps to ground systems.
Page 2 of 3
Give Top Billing to Strategic Arms
Unfortunately, neither of the delegations in Geneva has had the authority to explore how each side views the
relationship between offense and defense, and how a move by both sides to reduce levels of offense might justify
both sides' reliance on modest levels of defense.
Only when this kind of discourse matures can mankind imagine the possibilities for charting mutually acceptable
courses toward both reducing offensive forces and keeping our separate defensive systems within fiscally and
militarily sensible bounds.
But because it is at this level that the greatest gains (or losses) can be made in reducing the risks of nuclear
conflict, this is where our emphasis should be - not on medium-range forces.
While it is reasonable to deal with those forces in due course, there are no reasons for dealing with that problem
first. Indeed, those who worry that an I.N.F. agreement will both leave Europe vulnerable to Soviet conventionalwarfare
superiority and raise questions about the credibility of American guarantees of European security make a
lot of sense.
There is a more fundamental reason for tending to the strategic arms talks first. For six years, the American people
have been investing heavily in renewing our strategic power. One often-stated reason for that investment - beyond
the restoration of deterrence - has been that it enables us to ''bargain from strength'' toward some ground rules to
reduce strategic systems in the future. But if nothing is achieved at the bargaining table, how much longer can
Washington hope for public support?
And there is a corollary argument vis-a-vis Moscow. Periods of high public support for defense spending are
cyclical. Consequently, when they come, it behooves us to try to codify a solid framework for restraining Moscow in
the future.
The Russians read our headlines reporting Congressional misgivings over the defense budget. And while the
Russians need a lot of Western help in the way of credits and high technology, surely we are not so naive as to give

True, the historical tape cannot be replayed. The dead cannot be brought back to life. But the need to examine the underlying policy assumptions and practices that led to this disaster is more urgent than ever before. ","The course of United States-Iranian relations has been distorted over the past decade by a series of bizarre and
improbable events - the collapse of the Shah, the taking of American hostages, the Iran-contra affair. To that list
must now be added the death of 290 individuals on board Iran Air Flight 655.
The course of United States-Iranian relations has been distorted over the past decade by a series of bizarre and
improbable events - the collapse of the Shah, the taking of American hostages, the Iran-contra affair. To that list
must now be added the death of 290 individuals on board Iran Air Flight 655. The tragedy will plague relations
between Iran and the United States long after the investigations are completed and the public rhetoric subsides.
This painful disaster is simply the latest casualty of a policy that has lost its sense of direction. It could not come
at a worse moment.
There are growing signs that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is seriously ill and that a power struggle is under way
in Teheran to determine who will succeed him. The downing of the Iranian airliner will be exploited by the
ultra-militants to strengthen their position and to mask once again the shortcomings of their own failed policies
beneath the shouts of opposition to the Great Satan.
Over the past few months, our forces have been deployed aggressively and provocatively in the hottest parts of
the Persian Gulf. We have assumed responsibility not only for ships that fly our flag - including the 11 reflagged
Kuwaiti tankers -but for any ship that finds itself under attack. This expansion of the United States' role was a
disaster waiting to happen. Over the past weekend, it did.
On Sunday, a non-American merchant ship was accosted by Iranian speedboats in the Strait of Hormuz. The
merchantman did not request assistance, although the cruiser Vincennes and other American ships were in the
vicinity. After the incident had ended - apparently without damage - the United States commander sent a
helicopter to check on the Iranian boats. One of the boats reportedly fired at the helicopter, starting a skirmish that
ended with the airliner being shot down by mistake as it took off directly over the combat zone.
One can have only sympathy for the naval commanders in the gulf who are operating in close quarters, close to a
hostile coast, surrounded by hundreds of commercial ships and planes, among which may be lurking an enemy.
These skilled professionals are required to make split-second decisions of life and death every working day on
the basis of fragmentary information.
There is no such thing as a risk-free foreign policy, and United States military forces are trained and equipped to
put their lives on the line in the interest of national security. We are properly concerned with the failure of
technology that permitted an Airbus to be mistaken for an F-14 fighter. But the real failure was not technology; it
was policy. The question in this case must be: What national purpose is served by this high-risk policy in the gulf?
The question is easier to ask than to answer. Our presence in the gulf began to grow in early 1987, following the
Iraqi attack on the U.S.S. Stark and the reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers. The underlying basis for the policy,
however, was the embarrassment of the Iran-contra affair, which punctured American credibility with the Arab
states of the gulf and created the impression that Washington had shifted its support to Iran in the gulf war. To
compensate for that bungled policy, America tilted sharply toward Iraq and tried to reassure its Arab allies by
providing a more active security umbrella in the gulf.",6,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,58,100,1987,0.644682247,0.608146245,25.33944,29.58162

Reagan and George Bush this week will be the ghost of another get-acquainted superpower session: The

Floating over the New York ''non-summit'' meeting between Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan and George
Bush this week will be the ghost of another get-acquainted superpower session: The Khruschev-Kennedy summit
meeting in Vienna, in which many miscalculations were made.
This time, however, the challenge will be posed not by Soviet bluster but by apparent Soviet flexibility. Mr.
Gorbachev, eager for new foreign policy breakthroughs, has conditioned the atmosphere for his visit with
important gestures. These include the Chinese Foreign Minister's visit to Moscow, the end of the jamming of
Radio Liberty, the release of additional Soviet Jews and a careful and forbearing approach to the challenge of the
Baltic states.
It will be President-elect Bush's ability to turn aside Mr. Gorbachev's probings for premature action without
conveying a sense of weakness or fear that will determine the success or failure of the meeting.
The event has been billed by the United States as both a farewell and a get-acquainted session. There will be
plenty of sentiment and no little irony to go around. For President Reagan, it is a long way from the days of the
''evil empire'' to lunching in New York with the Kremlin's master.
But the legacy of improved superpower relations and the apparent continuity symbolized by this luncheon could
be profoundly misleading. Important questions remain: Is Soviet change motivated more by domestic trouble than
international pressure? Is Mr. Gorbachev a wily tactician pursuing the old Soviet objectives or the progenitor of a
truly more benign foreign policy?
George Bush will have to give his own answers and strike his own balance in Washington's policy toward Moscow
- preferably one that is less rhetorical and more careful in assessing the sources of Soviet conduct.
Circumstances suggest that the President-elect's agenda for the Gorbachev meeting should be kept very general.
As the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ''One President is leaving office, so he's not going to have
promises to make, and another President is about to take office, and it's unlikely he'll have commitments to
make.''
For his part, however, Mr. Gorbachev clearly is a man in a hurry. At this stage, perestroika and glasnost, his twin
programs of economic and political reform, have raised expectations but failed to improve the Soviet economy.
Even as he travels to New York, ethnic and nationalist turmoil shakes the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe and
central Asia.
Meanwhile, Soviet foreign policy is at a delicate stage. The treaty limiting intermediate-range nuclear forces and
the improvement in superpower relations have facilitated Moscow's search for Western capital, especially in
Western Europe. But Mr. Gorbachev has yet to quell skepticism that his promises of change in foreign policy are
still more impressive than his performance.
Page 21 of 24 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The unfinished business in strategic arms limitation talks, Afghanistan, southern Africa, Cambodia and the Soviet
campaign to hold a human rights conference in Moscow - all are testing not only the extent of change in Soviet
foreign policy but Washington's ability to achieve the best results.
While Mr. Gorbachev is in a hurry, George Bush has to avoid rushing. The President-elect is understandably
eager to hit the ground running, but the American agenda is very different from Moscow's.
The new administration has heavy work to do before it can begin to talk about major deals with the Soviet Union.
It must establish a partnership with Congress to deal with the budget deficit, which in turn will condition the new
President's influence with Europe and Japan. It has to forge a consensus within the executive branch and
Congress on the main lines of foreign policy. It needs to begin overdue consultations with NATO on a post-I.N.F.
strategy to deal with conventional arms control, which will be shaped in part by change at the Pentagon. It must
devise a different strategy to deal with regional crises, especially Central America.
In short, it needs to hammer out an Allied consensus on the full range of East-West issues. This will consume
much of the new President's first year and must precede a productive summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev.
The Gorbachev and Bush time tables are, therefore, fundamentally out of sync. The American side is not ready
and cannot be ready to do serious business with the Soviets. Conversely, Mr. Gorbachev is ready and more than
eager to do business, hoping thereby to set the tone and the agenda of the new American administration even
before it is organized.
It is this conjunction of a Mikhail Gorbachev anxious to advance his interests, and a new administration not yet
having had the opportunity to set its own course, that provides the possible drama in",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,58,100,1987,0.644682247,0.608146245,29.61819,30.59757

In contrast to the Europe of the
early 1980's, the Western system is now clearly ascendant. But Eastern Europe's broad yearnings to duplicate
the success of the West, especially its economic success, are not the same as a triumph of Western values, as
some too readily proclaim.
As the new decade begins, Europe heads the surprise list. In contrast to the Europe of the early 1980's, the
Western system is now clearly ascendant. But Eastern Europe's broad yearnings to duplicate the success of the
West, especially its economic success, are not the same as a triumph of Western values, as some too readily
proclaim.
The societies of Central and Eastern Europe are wrecked but not yet reconstructed as either democracies or
free-market economies. And the final word is not yet in on how all this will play in a Moscow that now seems
behind the curve of change, rather than ahead.
President Bush has asserted, rightly, America's interest in the outcome of these tremendous events. We have
earned our place - in blood and treasure - at the table. The reconstruction of a new Europe, without American
participation at every stage, would simply repeat the historic blunders of the 1920's.
But there is another historic blunder to avoid: Above all, we must not become an inadvertent accomplice in a
Soviet attempt to divert Eastern Europe's march to democracy into the dead end of reform Communism. Still less
should we deprive the people of the East of their free choice by helping to consolidate Soviet domination of the
region through a so-called political Warsaw Pact.
Indeed, as we look ahead, several myths about the new Europe are already threatening to cloud our vision. The
first is that the Warsaw Pact has a constructive, stabilizing long-term role to play. No one wants the transition from
Marxist-Leninist dictatorship to democracy to be overtaken by mindless violence or a Soviet military reaction. But
this tactical judgment should not be compromised by a judgment that we are giving Moscow a free, even if more
humane, hand for an enduring Soviet supremacy.
The tactical consideration is short-ter - very short-term. Once the East German, Czech, Hungarian, Rumanian
and Polish Governments have held completely free elections, the Warsaw Pact will remain a source of instability
because it embodies Soviet domination of the region.
Nothing about the pact's history suggests it could be anything else. Its member nations are looking West, and
Moscow knows it. That explains why the Soviets want the U.S. and NATO to bless a future political role for the
Warsaw Pact. And it also explains partly the new Soviet haste on conventional-arms control.
The last six months have transformed the negotiations on conventional-force reductions in Europe. Far from
placing a ceiling on the level of Soviet forces, the talks could establish a floor that would justify their long-term
stay in countries -Czechoslovakia, for example - that do not want them or need them.
Therefore, we have good reason to readjust our sights on arms control. Newly democratic governments in Central
and Eastern Europe may have radically different ideas about the real threat they face.
Page 23 of 24 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
That brings us to the second myth: that the end of the cold war means the end of conflict in Europe. As the ice
thaws, old tensions warm, especially on the issue of German reunification. No one fears the Germany of good
times, the Germany of Helmut Kohl. It is the Germany of bad times, with a leader not yet on the horizon, that
rattles the skeletons of history.
Now comes the real test for the West - whether we and our allies believe in our own values and judgment. The
heart of our postwar achievement has been the restoration of German sovereignty and respect within the political
and security framework of Western democratic values. The oxygen for this heart is supplied by democratic
government, economic integration and trans-Atlantic collective security.
Will the economic and political accession of 17 million poor East Germans to the Federal Republic destroy what
we and the West Germans and the other Europeans have built? Do we need a strong Soviet ''counterbalance,''
still dominant over Eastern and Central Europe, to keep the German state (or states) from becoming what Dean
Rusk called ''a loose cannon on the decks of Central Europe''?
If the answers are yes, then we lack both the courage of our convictions and the elementary wisdom needed for
any system of security. We must never accept the idea that the alternative to a Soviet threat can only be a
German threat, and that the alternative to the cold war is a U.S.-Soviet condominium to ''hold down the
Germans.'' This is the realpolitik that could produce another war, not a true and lasting peace.
Prudence demands that we be prepared to deal with the dangers of wrongful nationalism as much as with the
dangers of wrongful ideology. But prudence must be allied with our values if it is to have any constructive
direction. We must not revert to a balance-of-power politics in Europe that sets one nation against another without
any way to assert the common interest or to reflect the weight of shared values. Instead, a ''whole and free
Europe'' must be anchored in the same Western collective-security system that has kept the peace since World
War II.
And that leads to the third myth: that NATO must wither away as the threat of Soviet invasion recedes. In his
speech to the NATO ministers last May, President Bush invested NATO with a new political mission: to secure ''a
whole and free Europe.'' This mission revives what has always been the alliance's primary political purpose, a
purpose shaded over the years because of continuing serious military threat. Now, the political challenges are
growing and the military problem is shrinking. That clearly calls for modifying but not abandoning the alliance's
essential purpose.
NATO's future role is not to become a retirement home for unemployed soldiers and bureaucrats or an arms
control seminar. NATO is above all an alliance of free peoples sharing burdens and risks and reconciling their
disagreements peacefully.
NATO, far more than the cumbersome Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (the Helsinki process),
with its built-in Soviet veto, has the sinews of strength that sustain European security. NATO alone stations troops
by consent.
While the new Europe takes shape, NATO's old role of deterring war remains valid. Once a whole and free
Europe exists, a version of NATO will be needed to sustain it - an architecture built on Western democratic values
and America's commitment to overall European security. Only that renovated NATO can guarantee enduring
East-West reconciliation. Surely, the states in between Germany and the Soviet Union, now recreating the
freedoms, will want to have their own relations with the only truly workable collective-security organization we
have known.
The new Europe, then, will not be built on the myths of a stable Warsaw Pact, the end of the cold war as the end
of conflict or the withering away of both alliances. It will not come from organizations dominated by selfish
economic concerns or those overloaded by vetoes.
It can rise on the principles of democracy, self-determination in the context of collective security and the common
values that have made the Atlantic ocean a bridge rather than a barrier. Its firmest foundations are
Franco-German reconciliation, democracy from the Atlantic to the Urals, free market economics, international
economic cooperation and the continued role of NATO. Only a",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,68,101,1989,0.652710377,0.616167702,29.61819,30.59757

The Persian Gulf Crisis is no exception, and two analogies in particular - Munich and Vietnam - might have something to tell us. ","International conflicts attract historical analogies the way honey attracts bears, because the ""lessons learned"" from
such analogies are supposed to help us avoid past mistakes. The Persian Gulf crisis is no exception, and two
analogies in particular -- Munich and Vietnam -- might have something to tell us.
The first, more familiar to older Americans, is Munich -- the story of the disastrous appeasement of Hitler, redeemed
later only by horrible loss of life in a terrible war. The second, more familiar to younger Americans, is Vietnam -- the
story of disastrous American military involvement, never redeemed despite its costs.
Which analogy, Munich or Vietnam, the 1930's or the 1960's, has more to tell us?
Munich symbolized the failure of the international community to defend basic values: freedom, sovereignty, the
settlement of conflict without resort to force. Throughout the 1930's, Japan, Italy and Germany successfully
challenged those values.
Spurious historical claims, geopolitical ""interests,"" ethnic and racial theories were invoked by aggressors to justify
their conquests. Victims included both neighbors, such as Czechoslovakia or Manchuria, and distant lands, such as
Ethiopia.
That some of the states conquered were primitive or, in any event, remote from the concerns of the democracies
were facts used by the aggressors and their apologists to argue that their actions ""did not matter"" or did not ""affect
vital interests."" But each conquest strengthened the aggressors until finally vital interests were unambiguously
threatened.
Yet, the important difference between 1935 and 1939 was that the military power of the aggressors grew. When war
ultimately became the only effective means of resistance, the odds did not favor the defenders of freedom, and the
costs in blood and national treasure mounted dramatically.
Saddam Hussein and Iraq fit important parts of this metaphor. His stated reasons for assaulting Kuwait are spurious
history, a claim of economic necessity and a vaulting ambition to ""lead"" the Arabs. These are excuses he can use
over and over again to justify further aggression.
Page 2 of 4
Gulf Analogy: Munich or Vietnam?
Like Nazi Germany, Saddam Hussein's Iraq can only enjoy the benefits of its conquest if the international
community acquiesces. Armed with the benefits of aggression, including oil, Iraq will surely be much the stronger,
much better able to buy and perfect the weapons of mass destruction that its leader craves.
In short, the appeasement of Saddam Hussein, like that of his forebearers in the 30's, would favor a greater crisis
later and enlarge Iraq's capability to prevail in such a crisis. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates,
possibly Egypt, surely Israel, would be drawn one by one into either submission or conflict.
After an Iraqi victory in the gulf, it is all too easy to foresee the U.S. and Israel standing together against a hostile
Iraq-led Arab world. It is almost as easy to see Israel standing alone against an international coalition intent on
forcing it to take actions against its vital interests, the better to avoid a test of strength with Saddam Hussein and
the Arabs. In short, a real Munich.
The Munich metaphor, however powerful its appeal, must compete with another striking American memory:
Vietnam. The Vietnam metaphor appeals to two very influential groups, the moralists and the pragmatists.
The moralists saw Ho Chi Minh's Vietnam as a victim of imperialism; some also condemned the war as illegal
because it had never been declared by Congress. But both will find Iraq hard to fit into these categories.
No one seriously suggests that Saddam Hussein is a misunderstood victim rather than a willful criminal. And as for
the legalities, the worst distortion of the Vietnam metaphor is to believe that a declaration of war would have
mattered. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution served well until the war went badly. A declaration of war would have been
overtaken by the same loss of popular support.
The same would apply in the gulf crisis. Prompt military success or failure, not a Congressional declaration or lack
thereof, will determine the decisive level of popular support. Prudent and meticulous consultation, rather than
endless uninformed debate and authorizing votes makes far better sense.
It is not misplaced morality or misunderstood legalism that matters most but a far more potent Vietnam metaphor:
success or failure. Today, most Americans remember U.S. policy in Southeast Asia as self-defeating. It was a war
without clear political purpose or definable military objective.
Most Americans eventually joined this pragmatic group, forcing the U.S. to withdraw. Their question today is, Do we
have a gulf policy with clear and justifiable purpose? If we go to war, is there a definable and achievable end?
The President has in fact defined clear purposes: unconditional Iraqi withdrawal; restoration of the legitimate Kuwait
Government; protection of American lives, and peace and stability in the gulf.
He has justified these demands on several grounds: the stakes for international peace in the post-cold-war period;
the danger that Iraq might lead the gulf and the Middle East into even greater conflict later and the dangers to the
international economy of Iraqi domination of the oil supply. And he has said that the conflict can be resolved
peacefully if Iraq cares to do so -- that is, resolved in accordance with the Security Council resolutions, not through
so-called ""partial solutions"" that reward Iraq for its aggression.
Some ""pragmatists"" are troubled by the thought that this leaves no face-saving way for Iraq to get out. But we have
no reason to help Saddam Hussein unless we believe that by doing so we avoid something worse, such as war. But
if we believe that Saddam Hussein eventually must be rewarded to avoid war, then our current military efforts are
essentially a bluff and that bluff will be called. Such a display of strategic ineptitude would certainly bring evil
consequences for our friends and interests throughout the region and beyond.
If war comes, is there a definable military objective? Here is where the Vietnam analogy does offer a valid lesson.
When purposes are clear, means must serve them. If we are forced to military action, we must know that to expel
Iraq from Kuwait and to assure the peace in the gulf, we will have to destroy Iraq's capacity to make war.
Page 3 of 4
Gulf Analogy: Munich or Vietnam?
We should not accept the fallacy that because we want Iraq out of Kuwait, the war should be confined to Kuwait.
Nor should we succumb to a war fought by degrees in the belief, as in Vietnam, that a few good men, big ships and
loud noises will frighten the culprits.
War, Clemenceau said, is too serious to be left to the generals. By that he meant that military force must be
governed by the ends to which it is applied. The Vietnam codicil is that war is also too serious to be left to the
politicians. By that I mean that when ends are set, the military forces available must be used in a professional and
decisive way.
Thus, the Munich and Vietnam analogies both have application to the gulf but not exactly as many would use them.
The Munich analogy teaches us not that Saddam Hussein is already a Hitler but that we must act now to prevent
him from becoming one. The Vietnam analogy instructs us not that we should refrain from using force but that if our
purposes are just and clear, we should use it decisively.
Perhaps if this is well understood in Washington, it may be understood well enough in Baghdad for Saddam
Hussein or someone else to abandon this aggression without war.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,68,101,1989,0.652710377,0.616167702,20.48573,26.72819

"Patton Jr., George",1980,1,1992-03-09,0,1,0,WSJ,Army,1,,M,Now Read This,His point about reduction following research and development (even if it is limited) is absolutely valid.,"President Alberto Fujimori's ""auto-coup,"" putting an end to democracy in Peru, is indicative of a general problem
confronting many of the new democracies in the world today. In the Western euphoria over liberal democracy
spreading rapidly in the 1980s, some elementary realties have been overlooked. Francis Fukuyama's thesis, ""the
end of history,"" in its popularization, has encouraged our distorted vision. As media editorials chide Fujimori and call
for the return to democracy in Peru, they compound the distortion.
Why did Fujimori close down Peru's legislature? Peru has a very weak state. Many political and social enclaves
have always stood outside the state administration, resisted its taxation, corrupted the civil service through bribery
and profited from public sector pork-barrel spending.
A century and a half of such politics has left Peru with a privileged oligarchy that uses the state for its own purposes
and a large landless peasantry that is excluded from the system. The economy, although formally committed to
private property, is largely a ""statist"" economist system. The government owns the largest part of the industrial and
commercial sectors.
Fujimori bought the ""end of history"" thesis where it concerns liberal democracy coupled with a market economy. His
problem was how to privatize the state-owned sector and how to give property to the landless peasants. His policy
aims could only be loudly applauded by Americans. His problem, however, was that the political parties and his
congress were dead set on preventing the breakup of their privileged position, the introduction of equitable taxation
and private enterprise. His civil service was so corrupted -- or incompetent -- that it could not carry through his
decrees.
In other words, the Peruvian political system was virtually paralyzed, unable to create the legal, economic and
political conditions essential to stable democracy. And, of course, the Shining Path insurgency complicated the task
further still.
This predicament is hardly peculiar to Peru. El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and the Philippines are all
struggling essentially with the same problems. So are East Europe and the new states of the old Soviet Union.
They have highly statist economies that need privatization. They all have large landless peasantries that need
private holdings. And they have very weak civil administrations. They are extremely weak states facing perhaps the
most awesome tasks any government has ever undertaken. To succeed in the transition to democracy, these
governments must transfer the ownership of vast amounts of wealth and property. But electoral democracy and
parliaments give the opponents of reform the right to organize and express themselves. Their resistance to large
transfers of ownership is bound to create paralysis. Even if the parliaments pass sufficient laws to permit the
Page 2 of 3
Picking and Choosing Among Emerging Dictatorships
transformation, none of these states has the legal system or the administrative capacity to implement them
effectively.
If one looks at the deliberations of the Russian Congress now in session and views it through the prism of Peru, it
becomes painfully clear what Yelstin is up against. The same is true of Poland.
What are the implications? Does the Peruvian example portend a worldwide series of failures at achieving liberal
democracy? It does. Not all will fail. An elite consensus and shrewd political action will allow some to succeed.
Many, however, have very poor prospects.
Can the West help? Will massive amounts of Western economic aid save the day? Again, Peru is instructive. The
great stimulus for privatization of the economy and land entitlement in Peru was the drying up of foreign loans and
grants. The absence of economic assistance to Peru, where it was squandered in public sector spending, forced
basic attempts at reform. Providing new aid of this sort would obviate the need for change.
The same is true to a large degree in East Europe, Russia, Ukraine and other successor states. While direct private
investment may help, aid to these governments can only relax the imperatives of reform.
This may seem a painful dilemma, but there are no panaceas for escaping it. What Prof. Samuel Huntington of
Harvard calls the ""third wave"" of democracies is most likely to abate, and more than a few reversals can be
expected.
How should the West react to emerging dictators in these states? If they are committed to privatization and building
a strong and honest state administration, they could create favorable grounds for democracy a few years hence. If
they fall back on statist solutions instead of continuing with marketization, they will make future transitions more
difficult.
In a word, if the West is faced with a series of emerging dictatorships, it needs to discriminate among them. A few
might be the best hope for a future return to democracy.

Half-truths about who won the Cold War will not forge the necessary consensus to use American influence to promote democracy and free markets around the world. ,"Who won the Cold War? Who were its heroes and its slackers? Half-truths may confuse you if the presidential
election debate turns to foreign policy this fall. Worse yet, they will thwart effective U.S. leadership in stopping the
present international drift toward chaos and disorder.
The Republicans have been scripting their version of the story since the day Mikhail Gorbachev decided to call off
the Cold War. They insist that the man who called the Soviet Union an ""evil empire"" brought its end singlehandedly.
As in a western movie, the gunslinging sheriff tracked down the gunslinging cattle rustler, winged him
with a bullet in his pistol hand and brought him back to the county jail. The sheriff had to go alone because the
Democratic slackers would not join a posse. A new version has his deputy sheriff, George Bush, holding his horse
during the shootout.
Democrats offer alternative half-truths. Some were horrified at the ""evil empire"" speech, although they surely did not
believe it was a ""virtuous empire."" They argued that the collapse of the Soviet Union was wholly due to internal
factors, sometimes even adding that U.S. military policy prevented its earlier demise. Thus Ronald Reagan was no
hero because the cattle rustler didn't even have a gun and would have surrendered voluntarily.
The true story does not make good campaign rhetoric. The American decision to meet the Soviet challenge after
World War II rested on bipartisanship. Without it, the United States more likely would have retraced the path it took
after World War I, a bitter partisanship leading to isolationism and another world war.
President Truman took the formal decisions, but he counted heavily on Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg. Even
through the troubled time of the Vietnam War, a few serious-minded leaders in both parties kept constant the basic
thrust of U.S. military strategy directed toward the Soviet Union.
The Republicans presided over the largest reduction in defense spending in the postwar period -- 38 percent
between 1968 and 1976. Much-abused President Carter began the defense buildup that President Reagan was to
claim entirely as his own. The B-2 bomber, the intermediate-range missiles for Europe, a rapid deployment force
(without which the Desert Storm operation would have been impossible) and several other crucial programs were all
initiated by President Carter. He also made the first effort to seek deep cuts in strategic arms instead of the
codification of planned buildups in the SALT I treaty.
President Carter's human rights policy, launched in his letter to Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, sounded the
same theme as President Reagan's evil empire speech. The effort to bring about democratic transitions in Central
America began with Carter, and after criticizing it, President Reagan continued the policy. In sum, the record shows
more continuity than change.
Page 2 of 3
Who Really Won the Cold War?;Credit where credit is due -- on both sides.
Through the 1980s, what has been particularly troubling about some Democrats is their view that U.S. military
power figured little in the fading of communism. Many Russians, including Russian generals, assert the contrary. By
inveigling them into the military competition, they complain, particularly a ""qualitative"" arms race and a war in
Afghanistan, the United States drove them into economic crisis. Those who wholly discount this Russian version
apparently see no need for military power to enforce a New World Order.
Fortunately, other Democrats, particularly leading figures on the armed services and intelligence committees of
Congress, understand that military power does count, that the results of diplomacy are directly related to the military
power that backs it.
But just as an allergy to military power will not allow a president to lead in building a New World Order, neither will
an affinity for military power alone. President Bush conceived the phrase, but has failed to give it substance.
At the end of great wars in the modern world, the major powers have held peace conferences to establish new
orders. The end of the Cold War is no less dramatic than the end of the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic Wars or
the world wars of this century. Yet no major equivalent to the Peace of Westphalia, the Congress of Vienna,
Versailles or Postdam for creating a New World Order has occurred. Instead, we see the world drifting into disorder
-- Yugoslavia, Somalia, Peru and parts of the former Soviet Union. President Bush's empty slogan is as troubling as
the allergy of some Democrats to guns.
The post-Cold War challenge demands at least a modicum of bipartisanship. Half-truths about who won the Cold
War will not forge the necessary consensus to use American influence to promote democracy and free markets
around the world. Bill Clinton made a first step with his position on Yugoslavia. Equally encouraging, he has not
reflected an antipathy toward military power characteristic of some members of his party. Let us hope that he can
convert them. And if he wins, let us hope that the Republicans do not reject Clinton's bid for a new foreign policy
consensus.
In the meantime, take with a grain of salt any stories you may hear this fall about who were the heroes in the Cold
War.

It is late January 1993. President Clinton decides it is in the American security interest to oppose Serbian
aggression in the Balkans with force, in particular to permit the Bosnians to defend themselves. His advisers believe
there is a third option beyond the choices President Bush claimed he faced -- either doing nothing or sending in
hundreds of thousands of ground troops. Mr. Clinton's advisers develop a three-step plan based on the use of
American competitive advantages.
The first step is coalition building. The U.S. should not act unilaterally -- that was the mistake we made in Vietnam --
yet the U.N. Security Council is deadlocked on the use of force, as is NATO. A coalition is possible only through adhoc
arrangements. Three allies, Great Britain, France and Italy, must be included; they provide staging bases and a
limited number of air, naval and ground forces which support a U.S.-dominated air power operation. The coalition
arms and trains Bosnian forces, who conduct unconventional operations on the ground to recover their country.
President Clinton persuades several allies to agree to this plan. Here, Russia is a key player. Were Russia to
disapprove at the start, the coalition would still keep it fully informed, while leaving the door open for cooperation.
There is reason to believe Russia could be talked into participating: it has a natural interest in being seen as a
player on the world stage in this peace-making effort.
The second step is insuring coordination with United Nations operations and deliveries of humanitarian relief. U.N.
personnel become Serbian targets so the U.N. suspends its convoys. The U.N. operations are thus subordinated to
larger war aims.
But with coalition support, the armed Bosnians are as able as the U.N. to deliver aid. In addition, the United States
drops food packages on refugee areas from planes flying above ground fire. Bosnian forces create ""safe haven""
areas, which help prevent the depopulation of Bosnia and save tens of thousands of lives. The havens also keep
hundreds of thousands of refugees out of Western Europe.
Page 2 of 3
Operation Balkan Storm: Here's a Plan
The third step is active belligerency, in two phases: first, destroying Serbian forces in Bosnia and, second, using
concentrated force against Serbia itself.
In phase one, the U.S. uses Awacs aircraft and F-15 fighters to establish visible allied air supremacy over all the
territory of the former Yugoslavia. Next, Serbian heavy artillery and armored units in Bosnia are prime targets for air
strikes. British and French infiltration teams deploy anti-battery radar to locate Serbian artillery positions near areas
under siege.
From bases in Italy and from one carrier in the Adriatic, U.S. F-15's, F-16's, F-18's and F-111's systematically
neutralize the Serbian artillery units with precision-guided bombs and missiles. Using the Joint Surveillance Target
Attack Radar System -- Jstars -- or other sophisticated monitoring systems, the U.S. finds Serbian armored units;
fighter aircraft destroy them. Where necessary, A-10 ground-attack aircraft help escort Bosnian convoys carrying
relief supplies. Lacking heavy weapons and facing a resurgent Bosnian force, Serbian forces begin to fall back.
At this point, the Serbian Government in Belgrade could either up the ante or back off. Desperation, however, may
drive the Serbs to test the coalition's resolve by sending new forces into Bosnia from bases in Serbia and
Montenegro, by renewing the conflict in Croatia, or by starting a diversionary war in Kosovo, or any combination of
the above.
Such action would prompt phase two: U.S. aircraft and Tomahawk missiles destroy centers of gravity in Serbia. We
instruct Serbian troops to stay in their barracks; if they do not, we track their movements with Jstars and hit them
with air strikes. Technology using carbon-fiber strands allows us to render useless Serbia's electricity grid, without
destroying it, so that once hostilities cease power may be restored.
Other technology allows us to turn petroleum products in refineries and storage tanks into useless jelly, without
destroying the facilities. We destroy Serbian communication installations. At the same time, we take over Serbian
air waves to make our intentions to end the war clear to the Serbian people.
That is a war the Serbians cannot win.
Such an operation need not involve huge forces. This would be a joint Air Force-Navy operation of moderate
difficulty. The U.S. would need, approximately: one carrier battle group with about 60 aircraft in the Adriatic; plus 3
Awacs, 1 Jstar, 5 to 10 KC-135 tankers, 24 A-10's, 24 F-15's, 18 F-111's and 24 F-16's with assorted stand-off and
precision-guided weapons.
The operation would not be free, but United States costs in blood and treasure would be modest compared with that
of the Bosnian trauma. Moreover, there are indications that, if asked, Saudi Arabia would be willing to consider
paying a substantial share of these costs. Other states would also likely contribute.
A win in the Balkans would establish U.S. leadership in the post-cold war world in a way that Operation Desert
Storm never could",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,69,102,1991,0.658970806,0.618695141,23.47477,31.05008

Even allowing that the American contribution to the collapse of Marxism was elatively small, the role is no less striking. Anything that shortened  an ideological change of such immense consequences is worth serious study.","At a meeting not long ago, I asked Ambassador Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Foreign Relations
Committee in the 1980's, what role U.S. policy in general and the Strategic Defense Initiative in particular played in
the Soviet Union's collapse. His answer was straightforward: ""You accelerated our catastrophe by about five years.""
Remarkable. More than remarkable in that an investment of about $26 billion saved us and our allies at least five
years of much higher defense budgets -- certainly more than $100 billion -- not to mention ending an era in which all
humankind lived under a balance of terror.
But today the subject of ""Star Wars"" is raised not in the context of its strategic worth but rather for its potential for
scandal -- an interesting comment on our political and social values.
Even allowing that the American contribution to the collapse of Marxism was relatively small, that role is no less
striking. Anything that shortened an ideological change of such immense consequence is worth serious study.
In 1982, 25 years into the missile age, the U.S. had just about lost the struggle to maintain a strategic military
balance based on offensive deterrence. It was clear that the Soviet Union would always be able to put more
missiles in the field; it was not inhibited by an elected Congress or competing social demands on the treasury. The
U.S. would have to compensate with superior quality, and for a time we did.
But by the end of 1982, when I was deputy national security adviser, two things seemed clear to me. First, we had
squeezed just about all the comparative advantage we would find out of our technology, at least in offensive terms.
Second, the American people and Congress were getting worried about a strategy that relied on building more and
more nuclear weapons.
But what to do? We had to find a way either to get the Soviet Union to reduce the number of its warheads or to
increase ours until we could fashion a new strategy. Unfortunately, we didn't have much leverage.
The value of defensive technologies -- the ability with confidence to destroy incoming missiles before they come
close enough to do damage -- seemed attractive for many reasons. We had made a serious effort in the late 1960's
Page 2 of 3
Consider What Star Wars Accomplished
to develop an effective anti-missile missile but were forced to conclude that the state of the art still favored the
attacker.
By late 1982, however, new discoveries had been made. Adm. James Watkins, then chief of naval operations,
advised Adm. John Poindexter and me that gains in the computational speed of computers and developments in
high-energy physics (lasers, particle beams and other directed energy) had substantially lowered the technological
risk of developing a truly effective antiballistic missile sytem.
As promising as the military implications might be, it seemed to me that such an investment would offer even
greater political and economic leverage. Most important to me was the prospect that, as with the space program in
the 1960's, our dedication of hundreds of scientists and engineers to this frontier technology would lead to scores of
discoveries, all visible to the entire Marxist family and making it clear that our system worked better than theirs. To
avoid such a threat to the ideological firmament, the Kremlin might be willing to pay a high price. Star Wars might
be the leverage needed to get the Russians to decrease their number of land-based ICBM warheads.
Carrying out such a strategy faced huge problems. But I believed that if we played our cards right with Congress
and the allies, we wouldn't have to build this system -- the Soviets would come our way on arms control. Slowly,
everything came together, and by 1985 the program was a living ""line item"" in the budget.
As is now well known, our strategy worked. In Geneva, Mikhail Gorbachev and President Reagan pledged to
reduce nuclear warheads by at least 50 percent for the first time. We had turned a corner.
As for the reports now that the Pentagon ""rigged the tests"" of Star Wars technology, I don't believe them. Surely no
such ""deception plan"" was ever proposed to the President. And because any backfire would redound to his
discredit, any such plan would have been cleared with him in advance by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. I
don't believe that there was such a plan. After three failures -- all truthfully reported -- when a success was reported
in the same manner, I saw no reason to doubt it. As we all know now, hitting a missile with a ground-based
interceptor isn't as Buck Rogers a problem as it once was.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,67,103,1993,0.704352682,0.633637427,23.47477,31.05008

At the same time, he is restoring political forces that will make economic and poitical reform difficult if not possible. ","President Boris Yeltsin's bold action in closing down the Russian parliament has won high praise from President
Clinton. Yet Yeltsin's new course carries ominous implications having nothing to do with the legal basis for it.
There is no Russian constitution to violate. A constitution exists only when there is an elite consensus on the rules
for deciding who rules. There is no such consensus in Russia. Whether one can be achieved without further
violence is an open question, but Yeltsin's action at least makes progress toward it possible, and for that he
deserves tempered Western support.
He defeated the parliament because the military supports him, but Yeltsin is paying a price for it. When the
Commonwealth of Independent States proved unwilling to create a joint armed forces in the spring of 1992, Yeltsin
authorized a purely Russian military establishment. By June 1992, the Russian Defense Ministry had produced a
draft ""military doctrine,"" later submitting it as a draft law to the parliament.
The thrust of this doctrine, enthusiastically supported by Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, is to reestablish Russian
military control over the former Soviet Union, the so-called ""near abroad."" Yeltsin has yet to take a clear public
stand on it, but recently he has backed its de facto implementation in the ""near abroad,"" a step wholly at odds with
the Foreign Ministry's policy toward the ""far abroad"" -- i.e., the rest of the world. This includes supporting Abkhazian
rebels against the Georgian government, being an accomplice in Gaidar Aliyev's coming to power after a military
coup in Azerbaijan, using Russian forces to keep the old Communists in power in Tajikistan, where civil war has
claimed more than 50,000 lives, issuing threats and causing quarrels aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, letting the
rogue Russian 14th Army in eastern Moldova carve out an independent Trans-Dneister republic and dragging its
feet on troop withdrawals from the Baltic states.
Until last summer, Yeltsin kept his distance from most of these operations. Even Gen. Pavel Grachev occasionally
pleads innocence as his forces are carrying them out. In the spring of 1993, Grachev announced that the ""first
echelon"" of Russia's military posture in the south would be on the north side of the Caucasus. Now that Russian
meddling has helped turn Georgia into warring factions against Eduard Shevardnadze's regime, Grachev insists on
Russia's ""first echelon"" extending to the Turkish border, requiring indefinite Russian military basing in Georgia.
In Central Asia, Yeltsin has gone along with Grachev's insistence on controlling the Tajik border with Afghanistan
and using Russian troops in the civil war there. A few Russian parliamentarians warned that this could lead Russia
back into another Afghanistan fiasco, but they were ignored.
Given the Russian public resistance to military conscription, Yeltsin has authorized more than 150,000 ""contract""
soldiers who receive very high pay for voluntary service in ""dangerous places."" Only thus can these ""peace-making""
Page 2 of 3
Yeltsin's Deal With the Devil
Russian forces be manned. The Defense Ministry's debt to military industry is now more than 1 trillion rubles, in
part, because its manpower costs for foreign deployments are growing.
Military industrial bureaucrats also like these policies because they promise to restore much of the old militaryindustrial
complex. In Belarus, they conspire against the government with Russian military industrialists to keep
their factories producing arms, selling someof them to Tajikistan. Similar industrialist sentiments for ties to Russia
are now manifest in Kazakhstan and Ukraine.
In a word, a new Russian empire is in the making. To get a military constituency for routing the parliament, Yeltsin
supports the ""near abroad"" foreign policy of the Defense Ministry and the military industrialists. As that imperial
policy succeeds, Russia's military requirements will go up, its incentives for converting much of its military industry
will decline, and eventually its domestic policies must become repressive to contain popular objections to costs of
the new empire. This is hardly the road to constitutionalism and market reforms.
Little wonder that the parliament is politically isolated. As Disraeli ""dished the Whigs"" by stealing their program in
19th century Britain, Yeltsin is ""dishing the parliament,"" which supports Rutskoi and other proponents of restoring
the empire.
Let us suppose that the December elections produce a new parliament that is committed to economic reform and
cooperation with Yeltsin. Will that be compatible with Grachev's foreign policy toward the ""near abroad""? Military
expenditures, already a large factor in the uncontrolled budget deficit, will be difficult to reduce. And the economic
entanglements with the other republics will give new life to the old economic nomenklatura and resistance to market
reforms.
Yeltsin at last has a political coalition that can break the political paralysis in Moscow. At the same time, he is
restoring political forces that will make liberal economic and political reform difficult if not impossible.
Perhaps he will be equally skilled in breaking the power of the constituency that helped him close the parliament.
That is the gamble the United States is taking with Yeltsin.

It will surprise many people with whom I have worked on behalf of missing servicemen from the Vietnam War that I applaud President Clinton's decision to lift trade sanctions against Vietnam. The veterans' groups that have criticized the President should be aware that commencing trade with Vietnam can help the P.O.W./M.I.A. cause. Yesterday's announcement that Hanoi will release the remains of additional American soldiers is a promising first step.

In July 1993, Mr. Clinton indicated four areas in which Vietnamese assistance in the search for missing Americans was needed. An intensive diplomatic effort, with Vietnamese cooperation, has achieved significant progress in all four:

* Remains. Last year, the remains of 67 servicemen came home. This was the third highest total in any year since the war's end.

* Discrepancies. The military has calculated that 196 servicemen were known to be alive after the incidents leading to their disappearance. In 1993, 82 of those unknown cases were confirmed to have died. Hundreds of reported sightings of live American prisoners have been investigated on the ground in Vietnam since 1991, but none have produced evidence that Americans are captive today.

* Vietnamese documents. For the first time, we have received records from Vietnamese anti-aircraft units that were posted along the Ho Chi Minh trail, from a key wartime military-political unit and from Hanoi's postwar investigations to locate Americans' remains. At least 24,000 documents and artifacts, more than had been received in the entire postwar period, were released.

* Cooperation with Laos. In August, the Vietnamese and the Laotians agreed to U.S. requests for trilateral investigations along their border and the Ho Chi Minh trail. The first operation, in December, located some remains and several crash sites to be excavated in coming months.

Although Vietnamese officials have been very helpful, there are thousands of acres still to be examined and many potential witnesses still to be identified. Lifting the embargo will make it possible for Americans to scour the country and talk to civilians in villages and rural areas.

The President should make sure that the relatives of those missing in action have access to all the locations they need to explore. Then they will see for themselves how helpful the Vietnamese people are being. In addition, having an official U.S. diplomatic presence in Vietnam will be of great help to the effort.

I lost a son as a result of his exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam. As a parent and a wartime commander, I know the anguish these families feel.

That is probably too much to hope for, but not many other straws are there to grasp.","Air strikes have never brought down a regime, caused an army to surrender or ended a civil war. What, then, can we expect to result from NATO's threat to launch air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia on Monday?

The only certain outcome will be that NATO becomes yet another belligerent in this multisided war. The ostensible objective, a sustained cessation of hostilities in Bosnia, is the least likely outcome.

Are air strikes a strategic error? They could be, but not for the reasons most widely proclaimed, such as the lack of public support and the impossibility of achieving peace. The true reason is the lack of a compelling strategic blueprint that ties together the Bosnian war with the future of Europe.

With no Soviet military threat, NATO seems to have no mission. That is a dangerous illusion. NATO faces a major challenge it refuses to recognize: preventing instability and civil wars in East Europe, including former Yugoslavia, for a decade or so while the former communist states transform their political and economic systems. If NATO refuses to accept this mission, Europe will regress to its earlier patterns of diplomatic and military competition. Yet Mr. Clinton turned down pleas from the leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to bring at least those four states under the NATO umbrella.

The Bosnian crisis painfully shows us what more of East Europe may soon look like if NATO continues its strategic blindness. Three years ago a rather small NATO force could have prevented the spread of civil war in the former Yugoslavia. Today it would take a fairly large force, perhaps 300,000 troops, and they would have to remain there for years, if not decades, while peace is negotiated. That may seem a large price to pay, but we will pay a much higher one -- the disintegration of European security -- when we can no longer deceive ourselves with token steps like air strikes, or mere threats of air strikes.

Bosnia's fate has ominous international implications. First, it has already caused unhealthy diplomatic disputes among Germany, France, Britain, Greece, Turkey, Russia, the U.S. and others. Second, it has had a sickening moral effect. An old American ally, Turkey, sees a clear message: Slaughtering Muslims is tolerable but slaughtering Christians and Jews is not. The Western European public watches the carnage on television and then goes out to enjoy opulent lifestyles. Will a generation raised on this indifference be able to defend Europe against any threat?

The third implication of Bosnia's fate of concern to its neighbors is that the conflict may spread to Kosovo and Macedonia -- and beyond. The example of Bosnia could inspire ethnic cleansing in Slovakia and Transylvania against Hungarian minorities. This is only one of the more conspicuous possibilities.

Some opponents of intervention in former Yugoslavia fear another Vietnam-style debacle. But the strategic stakes are different this time. Bosnia's proximity to Western Europe, its disturbing impact on Eastern Europe and its links to the Middle East create clear U.S. interests. Likewise, NATO has a strong interest in providing a security umbrella for those Eastern European states that have good prospects of a successful political and economic transition.

The two issues -- Bosnia and extending NATO -- are tightly related. They cannot be handled separately. Yet that is precisely what Mr. Clinton's national security team is doing. The administration opposes the expansion of NATO while agreeing to feckless military measures in Bosnia.

Defense Secretary William Perry asked precisely the right question: If air strikes are the first act, what are the second and third acts? Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.) has provided the answer: NATO must go ""out of area"" -- to former Yugoslavia as well as the rest of Eastern Europe -- or go ""out of business."" For acts two and three, Mr. Perry must push NATO to face its new mission, admitting four new members from Eastern Europe and supplying four or five divisions for a very long stay in former Yugoslavia.

A number of facile arguments are invoked against this strategy:

-- The American public will not support it. Of course not! The public has not been presented with a strategic vision. That's Mr. Clinton's job. But no one should be quick to prejudge how the public would feel about U.S. involvement. After all, who could have predicted in 1989 that President Bush would gain broad support for sending nine divisions to Saudi Arabia? In former Yugoslavia, less than two divisions would suffice as the American contribution; Europe would have to supply the rest.

-- We could not keep troops in the Balkans for two decades. But we've kept forces in Europe and East Asia for more than 40 years, dealing with old ethnic quarrels no less intractable than the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.

-- ""Let the Europeans handle it."" That's a cop-out. We know that the larger states in Western Europe will not allow any single one of their group to run the continent. Yet they cannot run it collectively. Europe has run well over the past four decades only because the U.S. took the initiative at key points, pushing through unpopular policies under a collective banner. Europe cannot and will not act effectively in Bosnia unless the U.S. takes the lead and drags reluctant partners along.

Assuming that air strikes alone won't achieve any significant results on the ground in Bosnia, they could still have one redeeming consequence: waking the administration up to the necessity of designing and implementing an effective NATO strategy for Europe.

Spreading the protective wing of NATO airpower over the Muslim enclaves has ended the slaughter at Gorazde, as it did at Sarajevo. But the move is strategically and militarily irrelevant. ","Although the Clinton-NATO ultimatum on Bosnia has led to a Serb pullback from
Gorazde, it has put compassion on a collision course with reality.
While the U.S. and Russia pledged yesterday to strive for a diplomatic solution to the war, that solution must
recognize the Serbs' supremacy on the battlefield. Spreading the protective wing of NATO airpower over the
Muslim enclaves has ended the slaughter at Gorazde, as it did at Sarajevo. But the move is strategically and
militarily irrelevant.
A Serb cease-fire will not change the fact that the Serbs, in a well-planned and executed strategy, have
""cleansed"" eastern Bosnia of their Muslim enemies. The Serbs drove the Muslims from their land and penned
them in valley towns surrounded by Serb-controlled mountains. Gorazde and the other towns where the Muslims
cluster are called ""safe havens"" but really are prisoner-of-war camps. Even though the Serbs have stopped
shooting into them, the Muslims' plight has not changed.
The Muslims depend on humanitarian aid delivered by the United Nations forces. But to provide it, the poorly
armed blue helmets must negotiate passage with the Serbs. Even under air attacks, the Serbs can impede, even
stop, substantial aid from reaching the ""safe havens.""
There is no need for the Serbs to capture the isolated towns. Sooner or later, the difficulty of sustaining the aid
will make it necessary to evacuate the Muslims to Muslim territory further West. The sooner this deal can be
struck, the better. Air attacks won't help. The Serbs are canny fighters. They can disperse and hide heavy
weapons; supply dumps and command posts can be hidden. The Serbs can also strike back. Anti-aircraft
ambushes can be expected in the mountains, and aircraft will be shot down. The harder the Serbs are hit from the
air, the more they will have an incentive to retaliate against U.N. soldiers on the ground.
Despite President Clinton's disclaimers, U.N. and NATO losses in the air and on the ground might well create an
irresistible impulse to introduce ground combat forces. We could end up in the very war we have sought to avoid.
President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher both indicated that air strikes are intended to inflict
pain on the Serbs in order to bring them to their senses. History tells us such thinking is a pipe dream. Since the
advent of air power, bombing alone has only stiffened the resolve of a resolute enemy. No political objective has
ever been achieved by air power alone.
Misapplication of force can be worse than no force at all. Not only is an air campaign likely to be ineffective, it is
bound to raise the Muslims' hopes that NATO, the U.N. and U. S. will join the fray in their behalf.
Having suffered and lost so much, they are unlikely to negotiate a settlement based on the status quo if they think
the international community will enter the war on their side, especially if President Clinton's proposal to lift the
arms embargo comes to pass. It is a certain prescription for a longer and bloodier civil war.
The Serbs have won that war. The best we can hope is to convince them to settle for their gains and to press the
Bosnians to accept their defeat. Allied energies should focus on that goal, not prolonging the agony through
bombing.

The argument that the U.N., NATO and U.S. lose credibility in proportion to the size of a Serb victory is nonsense.
The Persian Gulf War is ample evidence of credibility when military action stands a chance of success. That is not
the case in Bosnia.
The failure of a just peace is no defeat for the international community. Rather, it is the defeat of the notion that
outside powers can pacify a bankrupt state festering with age-old animosities.
Not only is President Clinton in danger of making the U.S. a party to a civil war, by drawing the sword on behalf of
the Muslims he would make us morally responsible for the defense and well-being of a million people for a long
time to come.

Rather, we at the Citadel are trying to preserve an educational environment that molds young men into grown men of good character, honor, and integrity. It is part of a single-sex educational system that has proven itself successful throughout history.","Last week Virginia Military Institute, an all-male state college, got the good news from a federal judge that it can
continue its single-sex program if it opens a leadership program at Mary Baldwin College, a nearby private
women's school. But it is likely that the government will appeal the decision. Meanwhile, the Citadel, another such
institution in Charleston, S.C., remains under attack. Unwittingly, so are some fundamental beliefs prevalent in
our society: namely, the value of single-sex education, the need for diversity in education, and the freedom of
choice in associating with, and not associating with, whomever one chooses.
When Shannon Faulkner received a preliminary injunction to attend day classes with the Citadel's Corps of
Cadets, she was depicted as a 19-year-old woman fighting for her constitutional rights, while the Citadel was
painted as an outdated and chauvinistic Southern school that had to be dragged into the 20th century.
But the Citadel is not fighting to keep women out of the Corps of Cadets because there is a grandiose level of
19th-century machismo to protect. Rather, we at the Citadel are trying to preserve an educational environment
that molds young men into grown men of good character, honor and integrity. It is part of a single-sex educational
system that has proven itself successful throughout history.
The benefits of single-sex education for men are clear: Says Harvard sociologist David Riesman, not only is
single-sex education an optimal means of character development, but it also removes the distractions of the
""mating-dating"" game so prevalent in society and enables institutions to focus students on values and academics.
In short, the value of separate education is, simply, the fact it is separate.
In October 1992, a federal appeals court ruled that ""single-sex education is pedagogically justifiable."" Indeed, a
cursory glance at some notable statistics bears that out. For instance, the Citadel has the highest retention rate
for minority students of any public college in South Carolina: 67% of black students graduate in four years, which
is more than 2 1/2 times the national average. Additionally, the Citadel's four-year graduation rate for all students
is 70%, which compares with 48% nationally for all other public institutions and 67% nationally for private
institutions. Moreover, many of the students come from modest backgrounds. Clearly, the Citadel is not the
bastion of male privilege that the U.S. Justice Department, in briefs filed by that agency, would have us all
believe.
While the Justice Department continues to reject the court's ruling affirming the values of single-sex education,
others continue to argue that because the federal military academies are co-educational, so should the Citadel
be. However, it is not the Citadel's primary mission to train officers for the U.S. armed forces. We currently
commission approximately 30% of our graduates, but only 18% actually pursue military careers. At the Citadel,
the military model is a means to an end, not the end itself.
Today there are 84 women's colleges scattered throughout the U.S., including two that are public. These colleges
defend their programs as necessary to help women overcome intangible barriers in male-dominated professions.
This argument has merit; women's colleges produce only 4.5% of all female college graduates, but have
produced one-fourth of all women board members of Fortune 500 companies and one-half of the women in
Congress. However, the educational benefits of men's colleges are equally clear; and to allow women alone to
benefit from single-sex education seems to perpetuate the very stereotypes that women -- including Ms. Faulkner
-- are trying to correct.
If young women want and need to study and learn in single-sex schools, why is it automatically wrong for young
men to want and need the same? Where is the fairness in this assumption?

""At what point does the insistence that one individual not be deprived of choice spill over into depriving countless
individuals of choice?"" asks Emory University's Elizabeth Fox Genovese in an article by Jeffrey Rosen published
in the Feb. 14 New Republic.
Yet, so it is at the Citadel. While one student maintains that she is protecting her freedom to associate, we mustn't
forget that the Citadel's cadets also have a freedom -- the freedom not to associate. While we have read about
one female student's rights, what hasn't been addressed are the rights of the 1,900 cadets who chose the Citadel
-- and the accompanying discipline and drill -- because it offered them the single-sex educational experience they
wanted. Why do one student's rights supersede all theirs?
One might be easily tempted to argue on the grounds that Ms. Faulkner is a taxpayer and the Citadel is a
tax-supported institution. But if the taxpayer argument holds, the next step is to forbid all public support for
institutions that enroll students of only one sex. A draconian measure such as this would surely mean the end of
private -- as well as public -- single-gender colleges.
Most private colleges -- Columbia and Converse, the two all-female schools in South Carolina, included -- could
not survive without federal financial aid, tax exemptions and state tax support in the form of tuition grants. In fact,
nearly 900 of Columbia and Converse's female students receive state-funded tuition grants, a student population
that is almost half the size of the Corps of Cadets. In essence, South Carolina's two private women's colleges
may stand or fall with the Citadel.
Carried to its logical conclusion, then, the effort to co-educate the Citadel might mean the end of all single-sex
education -- for women as well as men, in private as well as public schools.",9,SocialPolicy,,,1,,1,,64,103,1993,0.704352682,0.633637427,23.47477,31.05008

Intelligence issues are more amenable to this approach precisely because all the details cannot be debated publicly and also because only a small set of people need to be persuaded to take action: the president, two of his cabinet officers and key Congressional leaders...A presidential commission authorized by Congress can overcome both problems.  ","The intelligence community is in its greatest postwar crisis. The notorious Aldrich Ames case is only symptomatic.
The trouble began several years ago, remains unresolved and cries out for solutions.
At least four major factors are involved. First, the great intelligence successes in the 1970s, especially in technical
areas, caused a need for restructuring of intelligence institutions. Second, there were greater budget and personnel
increases in the 1980s than could be efficiently absorbed. Third, the dramatic political, military and technological
changes of the early 1990s have demanded radical redirection of intelligence efforts. And finally, intelligence now
faces radical budget reductions.
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan sounded the earliest alarm, calling for the abolition of the CIA now that the Cold War
is over. When they were chairmen of the intelligence committees, Sen. David Boren and Rep. Dave McCurdy were
sufficiently concerned to introduce intelligence reform bills, but the Bush administration successfully opposed them.
In the meantime, the intelligence community's reputation has declined in Congress. Viscerally fought battles over
the intelligence budget have become public. The CIA and the FBI are in a turf war over counterintelligence only
slightly less bitter than the war in Bosnia. Other turf and budget struggles rage on. All are symptomatic of deeper
problems.
This public tarnishing of the community's image is not only sad but also a danger to the country's security. And it is
unfair to the professionals who gave the United States a remarkable intelligence edge throughout the Cold War.
The nature of intelligence makes it impossible to acknowledge publicly their achievements in more than general
terms.
They probably contributed as much to deterring Soviet military actions as our military forces. The Soviet General
Staff knew that its operations were transparent to U.S. intelligence. Soviet military readiness, capabilities and
resource expenditures were often more accurately known to U.S. leaders than to the Politburo.
True, mistaken estimates occurred, but in the larger context, they were trivial. No U.S. military commander ever
enjoyed the intelligence advantage that Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf did in the Persian Gulf War.
The very nature of intelligence brings it to public attention only when someone believes it has failed. That is a
burden it has to bear. Some of the CIA's operations have been bitterly condemned by the media and by Congress,
justly at times. Unfortunately, these sensational cases do not reflect the more critical problems within the
intelligence community. In fact, they divert attention from them.

The Ames Case: A Symptom Of Crisis
The very best organizations lose efficiency and elan over time. General Motors and IBM averted impending
bankruptcy by imposing wrenching internal changes. U.S. Steel failed to avert bankruptcy because it did not
change. The intelligence community is no different. It will either change, or congressional and public sentiment will
bankrupt it.
The intelligence community's structure dates from the late 1940s and the 1950s. Only modest changes occurred
thereafter, although intelligence organizations produced dramatically new technologies and collection systems.
They were astonishingly successful at this, but their very successes made some of the old structure increasingly
dysfunctional. Had intelligence been a private business corporation, it would have restructured at least two or three
times by now.
Why has it failed to do so? No business reforms without the pressure of market forces. Government agencies
cannot overcome internal bureaucratic interests alone. Reform can only come from two external sources in this
case: three top officials in the executive branch and a few key members of Congress.
The president, the secretary of defense and the secretary of state have to be fully committed to intelligence reform.
The congressional intelligence committee leaders have to support it strongly, and the armed services committees
must cooperate. In other words, three members of the executive and a handful of key legislators will either
cooperate and reform the intelligence community or fail to do so.
Unlike health care and welfare reform, intelligence should not be a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans alike
in the White House and Congress become hooked on the quality of U.S. intelligence. Yet one party, then the other,
opposes or neglects reform. President Bush resisted Democratic initiatives in Congress, and now President Clinton
is neglecting an initiative from a Republican senator, John Warner.
Warner is pushing a bill that would establish a presidential commission on ""the roles and capabilities of the
Intelligence Community."" The president should support it. If Warner is trying to score political points, it is difficult to
see what they are. Moreover, he was hesitant about reform legislation a few years ago. If this prudent and cautious
man now agrees with Sen. Moynihan that fundamental reform needs consideration, it is hardly a partisan affair.
But aren't presidential commissions used for avoiding issues rather than deciding them? Not always. Commissions
alone were able to overcome turf struggles in certain cases in the 1950s. Intelligence issues are more amenable to
this approach precisely because all the details cannot be debated publicly and also because only a small set of
people need to be persuaded to take action: the president, two of his Cabinet officers and key congressional
leaders. The Boren and McCurdy bills showed that the traditional legislative course is not promising for intelligence
reform. Nor is putting it under President Clinton's ""reinventing government"" program, because it is inherently
partisan. A presidential commission authorized by Congress can overcome both problems.

"Joyce, Larry",,1,1994-10-03,1,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Remember the Losses - and Lessons - Of Somalia,"When American Troops are in a combat environment, they become the number one priority. Domestic agendas should be put on the back burner until the Troops are out of the line of fire. The President must constantly stay abreast of the military situation to ensure that military actions are consistent with current foreign policy.","On this day in 1906 my father was born in dusty Segoville, Texas. And on the same day in 1993, my son, Army Ranger Sgt. James Casey Joyce, was killed on a dusty street in Mogadishu, Somalia, at the age of 24. Today, I'll call my dad and wish him well on his 88th birthday. And, at a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, I'll observe the first anniversary of my family's most tragic loss.

The ceremony was arranged by No Greater Love, a nonprofit group that was formed to honor the memory of those who gave their lives in defense of this nation or who were victims of terrorism. Today, they will remember the 44 members of the armed forces who died in Somalia during Operation Restore Hope. My family will be there, along with the families of the other American casualties of Somalia.

It will be the first time that most of us have met, even though we share an unenviable bond. While we haven't had a chance to discuss it yet, I'm sure we share something else too -- the hope that this day of remembrance will remind the nation of the terrible price we pay when our brave young men and women in uniform are sent to enforce an invalid foreign policy.

As we dedicate the tree and the stone monument in Arlington to those 44 young lives, I'll also be reflecting on another memorial two miles away -- the one that carries the names of 58,191 of my old comrades. I always hoped that the terrible price my generation paid in Vietnam would not have to be paid by my children or my grandchildren. But that hope was dashed last Oct. 3. Now, I simply hope that the sacrifices of those 44 brave young men are not forgotten.

That is why the No Greater Love ceremony today is so important. Already the media's memory of Somalia is beginning to fade. Reporters and columnists continually refer to President Clinton's foreign policy misadventures and few mention Somalia. Three days before American troops were sent into Haiti, the New York Times reported that the anticipated invasion would be the first time Mr. Clinton had ordered American soldiers into ground combat.

What about Somalia? President Bush sent the first contingent of 25,000 troops to ensure starving Somalis were fed. By the spring of 1993, all but 4,500 troops had been withdrawn and the mission was turned over to the United Nations. The responsibility for what happened to American troops in Somalia after that lies at the feet of the current White House resident.

Our policy in Somalia changed dramatically when President Clinton let the U.N. secretary-general talk him into switching a U.N. humanitarian mission into a unilateral U.S. manhunt. In August 1993, Mr. Clinton ordered a 400-man Ranger Task Force to capture Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid.

Like our first naive foray into Vietnam three decades earlier, this new mission was ill-conceived. The task force was too small. The Rangers were denied their normal air support. Tanks and armored personnel carriers that could have reinforced or extracted them were also denied. And on Oct. 3, when they were outnumbered 30 to 1, the Rangers desperately needed all those resources.

Within 30 days, President Clinton realized what most military professionals knew from the outset: It was virtually impossible to track down an urban guerrilla warfare expert in the back alleys of Mogadishu, where he was once the police chief.

Ironically, it was former President Carter who had told President Clinton that a military solution wouldn't work, but a diplomatic one would. Because of a previous relationship with Gen. Aidid, President Carter had made contact with him and reported to President Clinton -- in the middle of last September -- that Gen. Aidid was ready to negotiate.

If we had already decided in mid- to late September to negotiate with Gen. Aidid, why was the Oct. 3 raid launched that resulted in the deaths of 18 more Americans? I got the chance to ask President Clinton that question face-to-face on May 12. The answer was, ""I don't know."" He told me he didn't want to micromanage the military and had intentionally remained disengaged from military matters in Somalia.

Tragically, no one told the Rangers that the rules had changed and to ""back off"" on capturing Gen. Aidid so a diplomatic solution could be put in place. And Robert Oakley, President Clinton's former special envoy to Somalia, is the only one close to the administration who has publicly acknowledged that there was a breakdown in communications between the White House and the military. He made that admission to ""Dateline NBC"" this July.

I hope President Clinton and future commanders in chief learn this from the foreign relations debacle in Somalia: When American troops are in a combat environment, they become the number one priority. Domestic agendas should be put on the back burner until the troops are out of the line of fire. The president must constantly stay abreast of the military situation to ensure that military actions are consistent with current foreign policy.

Had President Clinton taken these simple steps, there would be at least 18 fewer young men for us to mourn and remember in Arlington today.

"Sweeney, Charles ",1979,1,1995-07-19,1,0,0,WSJ,Air Force,,,M,The Sky Was Bleached a Bright White,"I believed then and continue to believe today that President Truman made the right decision to drop the bomb. As the father of 10 children and the grandfather of 21, I am certainly grateful that the war ended when it did. ","Fifty years ago hundreds of thousands of American servicemen anxiously waited at staging areas in the Pacific
dreading the coming invasion of the Japanese mainland, scheduled for Nov. 1, 1945. The Japanese gave every
indication they would fight to the death, as they had at Saipan, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. And while they prepared
for the final onslaught, an average of 900 more Americans were killed or wounded each day the war continued.
The Japanese could have surrendered at any point. But they didn't. So our government began to prepare for
another way to end the war. In September 1944, I went with Col. Paul Tibbets, whom I'd known for about a year,
to Wendover Field, Utah; at the time I was a captain in the Army Air Corps. Earlier that month Col. Tibbets had
been ordered to Colorado Springs, Colo., where he was told of the Manhattan Project and assigned to plan and
execute the delivery of an atomic weapon. The colonel would form the 509th Composite Group, a self-contained
unit outside the military chain of command to carry out the project. The code word ""Silverplate"" would take him
through the military bureaucracy.
Wendover was a desolate base -- Bob Hope had once called Wendover ""Leftover Utah."" Col. Tibbets didn't brief
me, or anyone else, on what our assignment was. Security at the base was higher than I had ever seen before.
The first Sunday at Wendover, a security officer invited me to take a ride into the desert. Standing in the middle of
the vast openness, he reached down and picked up a handful of dirt. He told me that a bomb -- 20,000 times
more powerful than any existing bomb -- was being developed, and that Col. Tibbets's group would train to drop
it. One bomb could reduce an entire city to ""this,"" he said, and tossed the dirt into the air. He asked me if I had
read Einstein's theory, which I had, in a Saturday Evening Post article before the war. I didn't understand the
physics, but I understood its implications. One bomb, one pilot, taking the place of a thousand planes carrying out
a thousand bombing missions. Tens of thousands of airmen were dying in Europe in bombing raids -- some my
friends, all my countrymen -- and still they could not accomplish what this one bomb could do.
I would train the crews to drop this weapon. I was told to keep this information to myself, to discuss it with no one;
I could not assume that anyone else knew, even Col. Tibbets. If we two were alone anywhere, we couldn't talk
about it except in the presence of a security officer and only in an isolated room at the field. Any breach of
security meant immediate transfer. I knew nothing of the mission itself or who on the team would take part in it; I
was not to refer to the weapon as a bomb. I could call it a gimmick or a gadget, never a bomb. And under no
circumstances was I to ever use ""Manhattan Project"" with our code name ""Silverplate."" So ingrained was this
secrecy that to this day I'm not sure who in our group knew anything.
After months of intense training at Wendover we transferred in May 1945 to Tinian Island in the Pacific. Col.
Tibbets redesigned the B-29s we would fly. Our squadron had 15 brand new, state-of-the-art aircraft. To gain
speed, range and altitude he removed all of the gun turrets except for two 20-millimeter cannons in the tail. This
modification and the inclusion of reversible props would eventually prove to be crucial to the Nagasaki mission
and save our lives. From Tinian we began to fly missions during June and July 1945, dropping torpex-filled (a
high grade explosive) replicas of the bomb, which we called pumpkins, over the Japanese mainland. This
familiarized us with the theater of operations and allowed us to continue to refine the specialized tactics and
high-altitude pinpoint bombing required for our mission.
During this time, Gen. Curtis LeMay had been firebombing Japanese cities daily -- dropping napalm-filled bombs,
which created huge firestorms that incinerated everything. In one three-day period, Tokyo, Nagoya, Kobe and
Osaka had been destroyed. The unrelenting bombing did not cause the Japanese to surrender.

When the first nuclear bomb was successfully detonated in a static test on a tower at Alamogordo, N.M., on July
16, President Truman gave the approval to proceed. Orders were issued that the first atomic mission could be
flown any time after Aug. 3, weather permitting.
Col. Tibbets had decided that three unescorted, unarmed airplanes would fly the mission. He would take the
weapon on his airplane, the Enola Gay; I would fly the instrument plane on his right wing to measure blast, heat
and radiation; and Maj. George Marquardt would fly the photographic plane to film the blast and its effects. This
would be the first weapons system ever used by the U.S. military that had not been extensively field tested. No
one knew what to expect from a free-falling nuclear bomb dropped from 30,000 feet -- some scientists expected
the planes to be blown out of the sky, others thought that perhaps a chain reaction would be started that would
destroy the world, and a few believed it wouldn't work at all.
The targets were Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata and Nagasaki. (Kyoto had been on the original list, but Secretary of
War Henry Stimson removed it because it was the religious center of Japanese culture.) At 2:45 a.m., on Aug. 6,
1945, our three B-29s took off from Tinian in the dark -- no lights, radio silence, and no fighter escorts. Orders
were that the bomb could be dropped only by visual targeting. The three of us rendezvoused at sunrise, 8,000
feet over Iwo Jima. The sky was crystal clear. As I looked to the east I saw the huge red ball of the rising sun.
Hiroshima lay before us, distinct and bright in the morning sun. Col. Tibbets began his bomb run. On a tone signal
from the Enola Gay, I prepared to release the instruments. Parachutes would open at 14,000 feet and the
instruments would float above the blast. I saw the Enola Gay slowly open its bomb bay doors and release the
bomb. I released the instruments at the same instant. I watched the bomb as it left the plane. I remember a
thought flashing through my mind: ""It's too late now. There's no string attached. There's no way to bring it back.
And if it works this just might end the war."" I then focused on the more immediate task of getting my airplane out
of there -- fast. I took the airplane into as sharp a banking turn to the right as possible. We were 12 miles from the
target when the bomb detonated.
The sky was bleached a bright white, brighter than the sun. Suddenly, my tail gunner began talking gibberish over
the intercom. Then the aircraft was hit and began to shake, and was hit again. My bombardier, who had been
shot down in combat in Europe, yelled, ""Flak . . . we're taking flak."" But the airplane was handling fine. And what
my excited tail gunner had tried to describe were concentric rings of donut-shaped, clear superheated air rushing
toward the plane and hitting the plane as a vertical cloud rose upward. It was a sight that no human being had
ever seen before. I watched as the cloud rose into the sky in every color of the rainbow. A huge white mushroom
cloud formed at higher altitudes and continued to rise above 30,000 feet.
We continued back to Tinian. Mission accomplished. Col. Tibbets landed first. Upon landing, he and his crew
were met by Gen. Carl ""Tooey"" Spaatz, commander of all air forces in the Pacific, and a tremendous crowd. Gen.
Spaatz pinned the Distinguished Service Cross on Col. Tibbets's flying suit.
We expected that the Japanese would now have to surrender. But there was no response. On the evening of
Aug. 6, Col. Tibbets told me that the second ""one"" would be dropped on Aug. 9 if necessary and that I would
command the mission. Primary target would be Kokura; secondary, Nagasaki.
The Hiroshima mission had dropped a cylindrical-shaped uranium bomb, the ""Little Boy,"" using a relatively simple
detonation device -- a gun barrel-like cylinder, down which a particle was fired at great speed to hit the uranium to
start the chain reaction. Because the firing mechanism was relatively simple, the bomb itself was not armed until
the plane was safely in the air. On the second mission we would be carrying a 10,000-pound plutonium bomb
shaped like a globe -- the ""Fat Man."" In this bomb, the core of plutonium was surrounded by explosive charges,
which had to go off at precisely the same instant; a micro-second delay in any of the charges and the chain
reaction would not get started. So the arming of the bomb could not be done in flight; it had to be done before
takeoff by skilled technicians. Thus, my crew and I would be rolling down the runway with a live 10,000-pound
plutonium bomb. And because of its weight, there would just barely be enough runway to gain the proper
airspeed. A crash on takeoff would have vaporized Tinian Island. The night before the mission, I watched three
B-29s crash on takeoff -- not unusual for full-fueled B-29s carrying a full bomb load.
It was vital to the success of both missions that the Japanese believe the U.S. had an unlimited supply of atomic
bombs and would continue to use them. There could be no delay in the second mission to sustain the
psychological impact necessary to force the Japanese military to surrender. Thus, we could not wait for a perfect
day. Long-range reports predicted that the weather would worsen over the next several days.
Col. Tibbets decided to use exactly the same tactics as on the first mission: three B-29s unescorted to target,
preceded by a weather plane. This now-distinctive formation of three unescorted B-29s flying at 30,000 feet was a
signature that could easily be recognized by the Japanese and perhaps allow them an opportunity this time to
Page 28 of 37 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
defend against it. Although I understood this changed the odds somewhat and might put my mission at greater
risk, I responded with the words that work in the military, ""Yes sir.""
The plane I would be flying was called the ""Bock's Car""; it had originally belonged to Capt. Fred Bock, who would
be flying the instrument plane on this mission. After the pre-flight check-through in the early morning of Aug. 9
and shortly before takeoff, John Kuharek, my flight engineer, reported a problem. In a reserve fuel tank in the rear
bomb bay, a faulty solenoid (switch) prevented the gasoline from flowing from one of the tanks, reducing our
reserve fuel from 1,000 gallons to 400 gallons. Transferring the bomb to another aircraft or repairing the solenoid
would take hours. With the weather expected to get worse, such a delay would mean scrubbing the mission. I
knew that we had to deliver the bomb now. I knew we could deliver it to target, but without the full supply of fuel,
the problem would be getting back. If everything went according to plan, we would make it. If not, we faced the
prospect of falling into the ocean. The decision was mine to make, and I made it. I decided to go.
In the pre-dawn darkness our three airplanes left Tinian at 3 a.m. The weather was overcast and gray. We knew
we would have difficulties en route because we'd be flying through bad weather all night long in strict radio
silence. We were to rendezvous over Fukishima, an island off the coast of Japan, at 30,000 feet. I arrived at the
rendezvous point first. Within moments Capt. Bock's instrument plane appeared on my right wing. But the third
plane carrying the photographic equipment was nowhere to be seen. Five minutes. Ten Minutes. Thirty minutes.
Still no sight of the photographic airplane. I was using up valuable fuel. I finally decided to go on without the third
plane.
I learned much later that the airplane carrying the photographic equipment for some unknown reason had gone to
39,000 feet, instead of 30,000. The pilot, not seeing us at 39,000 feet, in a further lapse of judgment, broke radio
silence -- potentially giving away the mission. He radioed back to Tinian: ""Has Sweeney aborted?"" The
transmission was received as: ""Sweeney aborted."" On Tinian, the command believed the mission had been
scrubbed. They didn't know if we had jettisoned the bomb or if we were coming back with it to Tinian or if there
had been an accident. They were now totally in the dark.
En route to Kokura a warning light on the bomb's fuse monitor suddenly began flashing. The device had been
connected to the bomb to monitor its three fuses: a contact fuse that would trigger the detonator on impact; a
barometric pressure fuse set to trigger at 1,500 feet; and a timing fuse set for 52 seconds, the time calculated for
the bomb to reach 1,500 feet. If the lights began flashing, that meant that one or all of the fuses had been
activated. I knew it could not be the contact fuse, for we would never have known what hit us. If the barometric
fuse was malfunctioning, we would be all right unless the plane dropped below 1,500 feet. However, if it was the
timing fuse, we had 52 seconds or less to find the problem and fix it.
My options were to jettison the bomb and hope to escape the blast, or rely on the weaponeer to correct the
problem, or pray that it was the barometric fuse. I chose to rely on the weaponeer. Staying calm, he opened the
monitor and started examining the device. He found the problem: Someone on the ground had placed two rotary
switches in the wrong position, causing a malfunction in the monitor's circuits; the fuses had not activated. He
quickly set the switches to their proper position, gave me an OK, and resumed his monitoring watch. My only
response was to whisper, ""Oh Lord.""
Again, our orders were to bomb visually; we had to be able to see the target. Our weather aircraft had reported
earlier that Kokura was clear. But as we made our approach I could see that the city was obscured by smoke and
haze. The day before, a steel factory in a neighboring city had been bombed and it was still burning. As we
started our bomb run, antiaircraft fire was coming up, breaking low and wide. Kokura was the most heavily
defended city in Japan. Nearing the aiming point where the bomb would be released, my bombardier, Kermit
Beahan, yelled, ""I can't see it."" I banked the airplane sharply to the left and set up to make a second run,
something that bomber pilots rarely do -- it gives antiaircraft gunners a second chance to nail you.
As we made the second run, I held course. The flak crawled closer. Again, Beahan could not see the target. We
started to pick up radio transmissions that Japanese fighter planes were coming up.
I decided to make a third run. I took the airplane up to 33,000 feet to confuse the antiaircraft gunners. My tail
gunner, ""Pappy"" DeHart, spotted about 10 Zeros below and climbing. Beahan still couldn't see the target. Flight
engineer Kuharek informed me that we had just enough fuel to proceed to the secondary target, Nagasaki, and
make one run. We didn't have enough fuel to make it to Okinawa, the closest American base.
Jim Van Pelt, our navigator, then charted the course and we proceeded to Nagasaki. The weather aircraft had
reported scattered clouds at 6,000 to 8,000 feet, practically clear. Instead there was 70% to 80% cloud cover. I
started my bomb run anyway. Visual bombing was no longer possible. If necessary we would drop by radar and I
would take full responsibility. Every few seconds bombardier Beahan advised me he couldn't see through the
Page 29 of 37 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
clouds. Just before the end of the run, he shouted: ""I've got it. I've got it."" His aiming point was between the two
great Mitsubishi armament plants.
As the 10,000 pound bomb left, the aircraft actually lurched upward. I then took the plane into a sharp turning
point. Time seemed to slow down. As the seconds ticked by, I began to wonder if we had dropped a dud.
Suddenly, the entire horizon burst into a stark white with an intense flash -- more intense than Hiroshima. Even
with my eyes squeezed shut the light was blinding. A moment later, the first wave hit us with unexpected force.
This shock wave was more severe than those at Hiroshima. But the aircraft was handling just fine. At Hiroshima
there had been two shock waves, but now they kept coming one after another.
As I completed my turn, I could see below a horizontal brownish cloud obscuring the city. As at Hiroshima, out of
it rose a vertical column in those rainbow hues -- purples, oranges, reds. But now the cloud seemed to be rising
faster; it seemed more angry, more intense. At about 25,000 feet, a white mushroom cloud broke off and
continued to climb at a rapid rate.
I ordered our radio man, Abe Spitzer, to send our strike report to Tinian: ""Nagasaki bomb dropped; results good.""
And to alert air-sea rescue. What we didn't know was that air-sea rescue operations had been terminated after
the garbled transmission to Tinian.
As we approached Okinawa I tried to raise Yontan tower. Okinawa was the busiest field in the Pacific, with aircraft
coming and going around the clock on missions against Japanese positions. I could see heavy incoming and
outgoing traffic. I was now virtually out of fuel. I had only one shot to bring us in alive. My biggest concern was
that without clearance from the tower on approach, I might crash into somebody.
I told my co-pilot to fire a distress signal. Nothing. No response. I was now committed. I told my co-pilot to fire
every flare we had on board -- reds, greens, blues. It must have looked like the Fourth of July above us. It got
their attention. As I approached I could see traffic being cleared. Fire trucks and ambulances were racing toward
the runway. We were coming in fast, with 600 gallons of high-test aviation fuel trapped in the plane's belly.
At 140 m.p.h. we hit about halfway down the runway and bounced 25 feet back into the air. As we settled down,
my number two engine quit. The aircraft veered sharply to the left and we were heading directly into a line of
parked B-24s. I hit the reversible props and barely got the aircraft slowed. We finally rolled to a stop within 10 feet
of the end of the runway. I was now so physically and mentally exhausted that I just let the airplane roll to the side
and waited for the trucks to come out and meet us. We had now been in the air for 12 hours.
Immediately upon landing, I was taken to the commander of the Eighth Air Force, Gen. Jimmy Doolittle. The irony
struck me. Here I was about to meet the man who had flown the first American air strike against Japan by
bombing Tokyo in 1942. And I had flown what might be the last mission of the war. After a brief informal report, I
turned to leave Gen. Doolittle when he called me back. He said, ""I can only tell you what they said to me."" With a
smile, he added, ""Well done."" Japan surrendered six days later.
Our dream had been realized -- by flying a couple of bombing missions we had avoided an invasion of Japan,
which would have produced massive casualties on both sides. I believed then and continue to believe today that
President Truman made the right decision to drop the bomb. As the father of 10 children and the grandfather of
21, I am certainly grateful that the war ended when it did. And it is my fervent hope that there will never be

Union. More broadly, the vote will be a statement on whether to integrate Turkey into Europe at a critical time in
Europe's post-World War II and Cold War eras. It is time for Europe's leaders to step forward and take a decision
to accept Turkey for what it is -- a reliable friend in war and a huge emerging market. A decision to bring Turkey
into the Customs Union will help preserve Europe and improve it.
A vote in favor of accession will also enable Turkey's friends in the international community to send a message of
friendship and cooperation at a critical time in Turkey. The government of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has set
accession to the Customs Union as its primary foreign policy goal. The French, Germans and, to a lesser degree,
the British have pushed hard for accession. The U.S., to its credit, has also attempted to make the case for
Turkey to its European friends. They realize that Turkey is at a critical point in its history -- it is prepared to move
toward the West, but it could also fall in another direction that might prove disastrous for the Middle East, Europe
and the U.S.
Ms. Ciller has taken bold steps to stabilize her country, to combat terrorism and to remain an ally of the U.S. and
Europe. The parliament recently supported changes in Article 8 of the Anti-Terrorism Law. This move was a
successful attempt to address human rights problems and to respond to concerns in the international community
about abuses in Turkey. The government has released a number of ""political"" (i.e., Kurdish) prisoners and
resolved the sensitive case against American journalist Aliza Marcus. Turkey has also engaged in quiet talks with
Iraqi Kurdish leaders in an effort to resolve legitimate differences among rival Kurdish factions. In addition, Turkey
continues to provide irreplaceable support for the huge humanitarian program in southeastern Turkey and
northern Iraq, Operation Provide Comfort, which protects the Iraqi Kurdish minority from persecution and attacks
by the Iraqi government. From the European point of view it is noteworthy that Turkey also provides
peacekeepers for the UNPROFOR mission in Bosnia.
In sum, since the end of World War II, Turkey has been a reliable friend to Europe on national security matters.
Now, it has become a big emerging market economy and the Europeans want to capitalize on the situation by
broadening their commercial activities in Turkey. I would observe that Europe cannot have its cake and eat it too.
An urgently needed gesture of friendship and cooperation can be realized with the approval of Turkish accession
to the Customs Union. The U.S. made a similar gesture to Europe on Dec. 3. President Clinton signed an accord
in Madrid which signals that the U.S. intends to maintain and increase commercial ties to its most important
market.
On Dec. 24, just two weeks after the scheduled European Parliament vote, Turkey will hold national elections. It
has been in the throes of political instability for months, since the coalition government collapsed in September.
This is not a situation that the West wants to ignore. The alternative to the Ciller government or a coalition
government formed by other Turkish secular parties would be Refah, Turkey's Islamic fundamentalist party. Polls
indicate that Refah enjoys rising popularity in Turkey, due largely to economic decline and a perception among
many Turks that the current government is unable to provide them with a better economic life. This is bad news.
Having been intimately involved with the far-reaching, tragic events surrounding the revolution in Iran, I do not
believe that Turkey is Iran or that Refah is the Ayatollah. Events since Refah won power at the local level in the
1994 elections demonstrate some sense of responsibility. But I think we should not be naive about the impact of a
victory for Refah on the national level. Clearly, we should do our best to pull Turkey toward the West and the vote
in the European Parliament provides the Europeans with the best chance to do so.
Page 19 of 37 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
No one should underestimate the impact of a vote in favor of accession on Turkish national elections on Dec. 24.
A negative vote will cause a backlash in Turkey that will undermine relations with the West, undermine Turkey as
a bulwark against violent Islamic fundamentalism and threaten the political and security balance in a volatile, key
part of the world.
Yet the case should not be based solely on negatives. I firmly believe that it is time for the West to make things
right with Turkey. For too long we have sought Turkey's help, received it, and then said ""Go away."" This is
particularly true of the Europeans, who see an attractive market in Turkey (especially given Turkey's participation
in the enormous Caspian Sea oil consortium) and welcome Turkish military personnel in the Balkan conflict, but
reject Turkey as ""not European.""
The European Parliament vote is one for integration and cooperation. Europe needs to encourage Turkey rather
than continue to move the goalposts on economic reform and human rights. If Europe's interests are to expand
trade and investment, to stabilize the Balkans and the surrounding area, to stop the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism and to promote democracy and economic stability in Turkey, the parliament should vote for
accession as a means of achieving these goals.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,64,104,1995,0.758338902,0.652339015,32.58749,24.49404

If the Clinton administration refuses to use its financial leverage to make Mr. Yeltsin realize this, then it at least owed the American public a clear explanation of how our implicit support of his grim war is helping achieve American interests. ","President Boris Yeltsin's announcement on Sunday of a cease-fire in Chechnya should be met in the United States
with the same skepticism that greeted it in Russia. Several cease-fires have preceded it, and all were brief.
The Chechen secession is anathema to the generals conducting the war and to Mr. Yeltsin. The Soviet Union's
defeat in Afghanistan in the 1980's was humiliating, but to admit failure in a republic the size of Connecticut within
Russia's borders is almost unthinkable. Thus, Mr. Yeltsin's peace plan is likely little more than a campaign tactic, to
be quickly forgotten if he wins re-election on June 16.
But this pause in the war gives the Clinton Administration one more chance to reassess its support for Russia's
actions. For 15 months, the United States has been implicitly condoning Moscow's crimes in Chechnya.
Since Russian troops were sent into Chechnya in December 1994 -- after Mr. Yeltsin had quietly tolerated its
secession for three years -- they have killed 40,000 civilians and left hundreds of thousands homeless. In recent
weeks, the troops have reportedly surrounded towns and villages and pulverized them with artillery, multiple-rocket
launchers and helicopter gunships.
Yet late last month, while this savage campaign was in full swing, Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with
President Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow. An upbeat Mr. Christopher said afterward
that our relations with Russia were in excellent shape. One of his aides said Mr. Christopher never raised the issue
of Chechnya.
Of course, the United States should not latch blindly onto the Chechen cause. The Chechen leader, Dzhokhar
Dudayev, may be the mafia boss Mr. Yeltsin says he is. And taking Russian civilians hostage is morally dubious
even when Russian troops are destroying your people. Chechen independence is a complex issue on which both
sides have legitimate arguments. But Americans should be concerned with our Government's de facto support of
unremitting barbarism.

Yeltsin's False Truce
After the invasion, Washington tried to justify it as necessary to maintain Russia's territorial integrity. More recently,
the Administration has expressed a pious wish that the Kremlin seek more peaceful solutions; on Friday, a State
Department spokesman criticized ""the indiscriminate and excessive use of military force.""
But Mr. Yeltsin knows such comments count for nothing. After all, the same spokesman had applauded a $10.2
billion International Monetary Fund loan as ""a vote of confidence in Russia."" No American aid or political support
has ever been made conditional on Russia's actions in Chechnya. In the last year, the United States has
orchestrated $17 billion in I.M.F. loans to Russia.
What does the Administration believe it has to gain from its complicity? Perhaps it has been trying to help Mr.
Yeltsin defeat the Communist Party leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, in the presidential election. But Mr. Yeltsin
himself has recently acknowledged what has long been clear to informed observers: He has little chance of being
re-elected if he continues a war that two-thirds of Russians oppose.
Perhaps the Administration feels it has been helping preserve Russian democracy. But many opinion-makers,
including army generals, have denounced the Kremlin's brutal methods. On March 25, Russia's leading democrat,
Grigory Yavlinsky, called on the West to make Mr. Yeltsin and his advisers ""come to their senses and stop lying and
destroying everything alive in Chechnya."" Mr. Yeltsin has responded to media criticism by having troops detain
Russain reporters in the war zone. Caucasians living in Moscow have been deported to their ethnic homelands. The
Clinton Administration's indifference has been mocking Russian democracy, not saving it.
While the Administration has claimed that Russia needs to maintain its territorial integrity, the war is rapidly
threatening that integrity. In January, Gen. Mikhail Barsukov, the head of Russia's security service, said ""The
Chechen can only be a murderer, or at least a robber, or at least a thief."" Such comments and the killing of Muslim
civilians have deepened alienation from Moscow throughout the other Muslim republics.
Russia's integrity as a democracy can probably be shored up only by letting Chechnya go. If the Clinton

"Evans, David",,1,1996-06-08,1,1,0,NYT,Marine Corps,,,M,The Navy's Blues,"""Adrift"" is the word most associated with the Navy these days, an image the newly appointed Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Jay L. Johnson, must work to dispel.","""Adrift"" is the word most associated with the Navy these days, an image the newly appointed Chief of Naval
Operations, Adm. Jay L. Johnson, must work to dispel. Well before the tragic suicide of his predecessor, Adm.
Jeremy M. Boorda, the feeling inside the Navy was that the service had lost its focus as a fighting force.
Three problems are corroding confidence in the Navy's leadership:
* The decision to assign women to warships.
* Weapons programs that do not support the Navy's post-cold-war strategy.
* A sinister perception that integrity can be hazardous to one's career -- if it means airing problems that might
embarrass the brass.
When Navy Secretary John Dalton announced in February 1995 that ""pregnancy and parenthood are compatible
with a naval career,"" many officers were aghast. The new policy summarily dismissed the problems that introducing
women on combat vessels would create.
The fleet has already experienced problems. During the six-month deployment of the U.S.S. Eisenhower last year,
the first carrier with a male and female crew, 39 of the 415 women on board -- 9 percent -- were evacuated because
they were pregnant. By contrast, only 3 percent of male sailors (171 out of 4,552) were evacuated for medical
reasons.
Women can play an important role in the Navy, but the plan to have half of all female sailors at sea serving on
combat ships by the decade's end is simply inviting more trouble. The Navy should temporarily halt this plan and
reconsider the entire effort.
As for the weapons issue, the Navy is pouring huge sums into the F-18E fighter-bomber, which does little to support
its current strategy. With the demise of the Soviet fleet, the Navy wants to reorient its focus from the high seas to an
enemy nation's coastal waters.

The Navy's Blues
The Navy should thus focus on increasing its ability to clear shallow-water mines and to lay down a curtain of
gunfire from sea to shore. Yet its mine warfare budget is declining, and battleships with 16-inch guns, which are
highly effective for shore bombardment, have been retired.
Instead, Navy officials are promoting a new, missile-laden ship, which will not be ready for 10 to 15 years. But
against many types of targets, million-dollar missiles are a poor substitute for guns. As Admiral Boorda said a few
months before his death (he called it ""Boorda's first rule of gunnery""): ""It is nice occasionally if the target costs more
than the bullet you shoot.""
For a fraction of the cost of these new ships, the Navy could put back in service two of the four battleships it has
mothballed.
Of all the Navy's problems, the most dangerous may be the perception that telling the truth will hurt one's career.
The perception is breeding a generation of cynical, risk-averse officers more concerned with getting promoted than
with fixing problems. And no wonder. Responsible criticism is now considered an act of disloyalty.
What the Navy needs is a system that rewards integrity. Perhaps two new questions could be asked in every
officer's performance evaluation: Is this officer willing to give bad news, even when the boss doesn't want to hear it?
Is this officer willing to risk his or her career for the men and women under him?
If Admiral Johnson insists on such a change as one of his first acts in office, we will know that the Navy is coming
out of its ethical crisis and is finally on the right course.",5,ServiceCulture,,,,,,,66,104,1995,0.758338902,0.652339015,32.58749,24.49404
"Odom, William",1988,1,1996-08-27,1,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Russia's Military: Down But Not Out,"Even if liberal political leaders prevail in Moscow, they will continue trying to increase Russian influence in Central Europe. The key point is that the political stalemate in Moscow has not sidelined Russia from this competition. It would be a serious error to conclude on the basis of its failure in Chechnya that the Russian military won't be able to back Moscow's diplomacy. Indeed, the Chechen debacle could have just the opposite effect--spurring the very reforms that have thus far eluded the Russian military.","After nearly two years, Russian forces have failed miserably to subdue tiny Chechnya. With the battle for Grozny lost, Boris Yeltsin's emissary, Alexander Lebed, has been trying to arrange a cease-fire -- with little success so far. Is the Russian military as weak as this performance suggests? The answer is no, for several reasons.

We have not seen Russia's best units in Chechnya. No airborne division is committed there. Nor are the better tank and motor-rifle units. And poorly trained Interior Ministry troops have recently taken a larger role. Moreover, personnel turnover in Chechnya has been extremely high: Most officers serve only four-month tours, and soldiers serve four to six months, far shorter than the usual 18 month tours. This rapid turnover produces low cohesion in tactical units.

Nor are Russia's generals committed to the war. They view it primarily as part of the struggle among political factions in Moscow. Political infighting sometimes dictates the timing and type of operations, hardly a formula for victory. Generals may even prefer battlefield failures if they undercut political opponents.

Further, the generals know there is no legal basis for the war. Several deputy ministers of defense lost their jobs in late 1994 for emphasizing this ticklish point. And many generals, arguing that the army has no business maintaining domestic order, want to turn the war over altogether to the Interior Ministry.

The Russian military is intentionally not putting its best foot forward in Chechnya. Could it do better elsewhere? Undoubtedly yes -- but not a lot better. For the Russian military also suffers from a host of systemic problems.

For one thing, the quality of recruits is low. Brighter and better-educated young men evade conscription both legally and illegally, leaving the poorly educated to fill the army's ranks. The quality of junior officers is also mixed, but in the field grade and general officer ranks, a significant reservoir of professional competence remains.

The command structures have the same pattern of weakness at the tactical levels. But since they have suffered far less degradation at the operational and strategic levels, the general staff can still move large forces from one part of the country to another effectively.

Combat readiness varies widely. Many units are as poorly trained as those in Chechnya; others are in better shape. The airborne divisions, for example, are in very good condition, and a few select tank and motor-rifle divisions are not far behind them. Air force units also vary widely, with most in poor shape but a few in fair condition. The major problem is a shortage of money for training. Lack of aviation fuel has dramatically reduced pilot competence in many units. The size and number of ground force exercises are at record lows.

Less is known about the strategic rocket forces, but most units could probably be employed on short notice. The navy, having suffered a dramatic decline in the number of seaworthy surface combatants and submarines, is no longer a serious force, though a small fleet could be recovered fairly rapidly.

Military industries have also deteriorated markedly. Yet some firms are still producing weapons, including newer and more advanced models.

On the whole, today the Russian military does not present a serious threat to NATO. The generals know that well, and they are intensely debating what to do about it. Many fear the necessary systemic reforms -- much deeper force reductions and a lengthy period of restructuring while putting most of the defense budget into research and development. But a large R&D budget would yield uncertain results until the transition to a market economy is complete and key industries are up to Western standards.

In any case, successful military reform requires a strong political consensus, which does not yet exist. Russian politicians do not agree on how best to deal with the West. Some reject cooperation; others realize that isolation would doom economic progress. Still, their common propensity to try to reassert political influence in Eastern and Central Europe is strong, and they are not without means.

And as long as NATO has not extended its roof over Central Europe, this region is highly vulnerable to Russian diplomacy. Moscow makes its power felt not only directly but also by encouraging France, Germany and Britain to compete among themselves for influence there. We saw an example of such trouble-making in Bosnia, where the Russians championed the Serbs and played on French and British concerns about German influence in Croatia. Russia diplomats are also active in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, encouraging these nations to believe and they'll have to accommodate Russia.

Moscow has also demanded a corridor through Poland to the Baltic Sea port of Kaliningrad. The Russian military, weak as it is, is adequate to support such diplomatic machinations from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Pitted against the military of any non-NATO state in this region, the Russian military remains superior.

Even if liberal political leaders prevail in Moscow, they will continue trying to increase Russian influence in Central Europe. The key point is that the political stalemate in Moscow has not sidelined Russia from this competition. It would be a serious error to conclude on the basis of its failure in Chechnya that the Russian military won't be able to back Moscow's diplomacy.

"Odom, William",1988,1,1996-08-28,1,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,"Chechnya, Freedom, and the Voice of Yeltsin Past","Is Clinton oblivious to his moral complicity with Yeltsin in more than 30,000 deaths in Chechnya, including several thousand Russian civilians? How can he, at the same time, take seriously Moscow's complaint's about violations of the ""human rights"" of Russians living in Estonia?","As he deals with Chechnya, Boris Yeltsin ought to recall what he said to Soviet soldiers as they rode into Vilnius, Lithuania, in January 1991. Lithuania was asserting its independence, and Mikhail Gorbachev was opposing it with tanks. The Russian claim on Lithuanian land is two centuries older than its claim on Chechnya, but Yeltsin understood that imperial claims are incompatible with liberal democracy. He stoutly opposed Gorbachev's intervention, speaking on the radio directly to the Soviet troops:

I am addressing myself to you, soldier. . . . Dictatorship is arriving, and it is you who is bringing it, sitting with a submachine gun in a tank. Could it be that you too have dreamed about freedom? . . . You have betrayed your generation. Do you think you are a Rambo -- a hero who defends law and order? No! You are again a pawn in a dirty game, a grain of sand in the Kremlin's building of an imperial sand castle.

This year you will take off your uniform, demobilize and tell your girlfriend how ""we bashed those Lithuanians."" . . . Those ""memories"" will be the only security you will be able to give her . . . neither freedom nor a good life -- for you have blocked that path with your tank. . . . It is you who have killed your chances . . . ""to live like civilized people.""

At the very moment when you are ""ensuring order"" in the Baltics, people in your native town . . . will also go out into the streets in the name of freedom. And to your counterpart, just as to you in the Baltics, it will be explained that he, too, is facing ""extremists.""

Yeltsin also should look at the cover picture on a recent issue of Novoe Vremya. It shows Russians beating a swarthy citizen of Moscow, presumably a Chech\en. The caption reads, ""Invitation to a Pogrom. Anyone Can Become `A Person of Caucasian Nationality.' ""

Guilt for letting the war continue is not just Yeltsin's. During his last visit to Moscow, President Clinton likened Yeltsin to President Lincoln during the American Civil War. Lincoln, of course, did not negotiate a truce during the war to get reelected. Yeltsin did, because polls consistently show a majority of Russians willing to let Chechnya secede rather than continue the war. The votes had not been fully counted when Russian generals launched unprovoked and murderous attacks against Chechen villages, falsely accusing the Chechens of breaking the truce. Unfazed by such treachery, Vice President Al Gore flew off to Moscow to support a $10 billion IMF loan to Russia -- money that inevitably will finance the war in Chechnya.

Is Clinton oblivious to his moral complicity with Yeltsin in more than 30,000 deaths in Chechnya, including several thousand Russian civilians? How can he, at the same time, take seriously Moscow's complaints about violations of the ""human rights"" of Russians living in Estonia? The Estonian crime is requiring that ethnic Russians learn to speak a few words of Estonian in order to vote! Is he unaware that Stalin committed genocide against the Chechens in 1944, deporting half and killing a quarter of the population?

Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott originally drew the analogy between the war in Chechnya and the American Civil War. After critics pointed out that it is more like sending United States troops to kill 30,000 people in Puerto Rico in order to prevent its independence, Talbott switched his analogy to France's civil war in Algeria. But he has yet to draw its logical conclusion: France eventually let Algeria go.

Clinton claims he stood on moral principle when he evaded the military draft during the Vietnam War, but that is hard to believe in light of his lack of moral indignation over the war in Chechnya. Presumably, he would say that he is acting pragmatically to save Russian democracy. If Russian liberals see the war against Chechnya as encouraging ""pogroms"" in Moscow, what kind of democracy is that? And what does his pragmatism do for democracy in Estonia?

Perhaps Gen. Alexander Lebed will save the situation. He knows, as do most Russian leaders, that letting Chechnya go will not cause the breakup of the Russian Federation. He also knows that his enemies are trying to destroy him politically by making him responsible for the Chechen issue. He could turn the tables by insisting that Chechnya be expelled from the Russian Federation. The sarcastic, no-nonsense paratrooper also knows that the Russian soldier in Chechnya is, in Yeltsin's words, ""a pawn in a dirty game, a grain of sand in the Kremlin's building of an imperial sand castle.""

"Zumwalt, E.R.",1974,1,1997-01-06,1,0,0,WaPO,Navy,,,M,A Needless Risk for US Troops,"If we refuse to ratify, some governments will use our refusal as an excuse to keep their chemical weapons…At the bottom line, our failure to ratify will substantially increase the risk of a chemical attack against American service personnel. ","It has been more than 80 years since poison gas was first used in modern warfare -- in April 1915 during the first year of World War I. It is long past time to do something about such weapons.

I am not a dove. As a young naval officer in 1945, I supported the use of nuclear weapons against Japan. As chief of naval operations two decades ago, I pressed for substantially higher military spending than the nation's political leadership was willing to grant. After retiring from the Navy, I helped lead the opposition to the SALT II treaty because I was convinced it would give the Soviet Union a strategic advantage.

Now the Senate is considering whether to approve the Chemical Weapons Convention. This is a worldwide treaty, negotiated by the Reagan administration and signed by the Bush administration. It bans the development, production, possession, transfer and use of chemical weapons. Senate opposition to ratification is led by some with whom I often agree. But in this case, I believe they do a grave disservice to America's men and women in uniform.

To a Third World leader indifferent to the health of his own troops and seeking to cause large-scale pain and death for its own sake, chemical weapons have a certain attraction. They don't require the advanced technology needed to build nuclear weapons. Nor do they require the educated populace needed to create a modern conventional military. But they cannot give an inferior force a war-winning capability. In the Persian Gulf war, the threat of our uncompromising retaliation with conventional weaponsdeterred Saddam Hussein from using his chemical arsenal against us.

Next time, our adversary may be more berserk than Saddam, and deterrence may fail. If that happens, our retaliation will be decisive, devastating -- and no help to the young American men and women coming home dead or bearing grievous chemical injuries. What will help is a treaty removing huge quantities of chemical weapons that could otherwise be used against us.

Militarily, this treaty will make us stronger. During the Bush administration, our nation's military and political leadership decided to retire our chemical weapons. This wise move was not made because of treaties. Rather, it was based on the fact that chemical weapons are not useful for us.

Politically and diplomatically, the barriers against their use by a First World country are massive. Militarily, they are risky and unpredictable to use, difficult and dangerous to store. They serve no purpose that can't be met by our overwhelming conventional forces.

So the United States has no deployed chemical weapons today and will have none in the future. But the same is not true of our potential adversaries. More than a score of nations now seeks or possesses chemical weapons. Some are rogue states with which we may some day clash.

This treaty is entirely about eliminating other people's weapons -- weapons that may some day be used against Americans. For the American military, U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is high gain and low or no pain. In that light, I find it astonishing that any American opposes ratification.

Opponents argue that the treaty isn't perfect: Verification isn't absolute, forms must be filled out, not every nation will join at first and so forth. This is unpersuasive. Nothing in the real world is perfect. If the U.S. Navy had refused to buy any weapon unless it worked perfectly every time, we would have bought nothing and now would be disarmed. The question is not how this treaty compares with perfection. The question is how U.S. ratification compares with its absence.

If we refuse to ratify, some governments will use our refusal as an excuse to keep their chemical weapons. Worldwide availability of chemical weapons will be higher, and we will know less about other countries' chemical activities. The diplomatic credibility of our threat of retaliation against anyone who uses chemical weapons on our troops will be undermined by our lack of ""clean hands."" At the bottom line, our failure to ratify will substantially increase the risk of a chemical attack against American service personnel.

If such an attack occurs, the news reports of its victims in our military hospitals will of course produce rapid ratification of the treaty and rapid replacement of senators who enabled the horror by opposing ratification. But for the victims, it will be too late.

Every man and woman who puts on a U.S. military uniform faces possible injury or death in the national interest. They don't complain; risk is part of their job description. But it is also part of the job description of every U.S. senator to see that this risk not be increased unnecessarily.

And it is our responsibility to ensure that it will not be.,"At the National Press Club in early December, I gave an intensely personal expression of my views on the case for the elimination of nuclear weapons. I hoped to convey the growing sense of alarm that I had felt over the course of my long experience in the nu clear arena -- including my tenure as commander in chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, which controls all Navy and Air Force nuclear weapons -- and how this has now evolved to a singular goal: to bend every effort, within my power and authority, topromote the conditions and attitudes that might someday free mankind from the scourge of nuclear weapons.

As I survey the response of what appears to be a rather astonished world, I am by turns encouraged, disappointed and dismayed.

Encouraged, by the flood of supportive calls and letters I have received from every corner of the planet because the issue has now been widely joined, with great interest and intensity, and because I can discern the makings of an emerging global consensus that the risks posed by nuclear weapons far outweigh their presumed benefits.

Disappointed, thus far, by the quality of the debate, by those pundits who simply sniffed imperiously at the goal of elimination, aired their stock Cold War rhetoric, hurled a personal epithet or two and settled smugly back into their world of exaggerated threats and bygone enemies. And by critics who attacked my views by misrepresenting them, such as suggesting that I am proposing unilateral disarmament or a pace of reduction that would jeopardize the security of the nuclear-weapon states.

And finally, dismayed that, even among more serious commentators, the lessons of 50 years at the nuclear brink can still be so grievously misread; that the assertions and assumptions underpinning an era of desperate threats and risks prevail unchallenged; that a handful of nations cling to the impossible notion that the power of nuclear weapons is so immense their use can be threatened with impunity, yet their proliferation contained.

Albert Einstein recognized this hazardous but very human tendency many years ago, when he warned that ""the unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe."" How else to explain the assertion that nuclear weapons will infallibly deter major war, in a world that survived the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 no thanks to deterrence, but only by the grace of God? How else to accept the proposition that any civilized nation wouldrespond to the act of a madman by adopting his methods? How otherwise to fathom a historical view that can witness the collapse of communism but fail to imagine a world rid of nuclear weapons? Or finally, to account for the assumption that because we are condemned to live with the knowledge of how to fabricate nuclear weapons, we are powerless to mount a global framework of verification and sanctions that will greatly reduce the likelihood or adequately deal with the consequences of cheating in a world free of nuclear weapons?

Many well-meaning friends have counseled me that by championing elimination I risk setting the bar too high, providing an easy target for the cynical and diverting attention from the more immediately achievable. My response is that elimination is the only defensible goal, and that goal matters enormously. All of the declared nuclear-weapon states are formally committed to nuclear abolition in the letter and the spirit of the nonproliferation treaty, which went into effect in 1970 and was renewed lastyear. Every president of the United States since Dwight Eisenhower has publicly endorsed elimination. A clear and unequivocal commitment to elimination, sustained by concrete policy and measurable milestones, is essential to give credibility and substance to this long-standing rhetorical position.

Such a commitment goes far beyond simply seizing the moral high ground. It shifts the locus of policy attention from numbers to the security climate essential to permit successive reductions. It conditions government at all levels to create and respond to every opportunity for shrinking arsenals, cutting infrastructure and curtailing modernization. It sets the stage for rigorous enforcement of nonproliferation regimes and unrelenting pressures to reduce nuclear arsenals on a global basis.

No one is more conscious than I am that realistic prospects for elimination will evolve over many years. I was in the public arena for too long ever to make the perfect the enemy of the good. I hasten to add, however, my strong conviction that we are far too timorous in imagining the good; we are still too rigidly conditioned by an arms control mentality deeply rooted in the Cold War. We fall too readily into the intellectual trap of judging the goal of elimination against current political conditions. We forget too quickly how seemingly intractable conflicts can suddenly yield under the weight of reason or with a change of leadership. We have lost sight too soon that, in the blink of a historical eye, the world we knew for a traumatic half-century has been utterly transformed.

Two days after taking charge of the Strategic Air Command in 1991, I called together my senior staff of 20 generals and one admiral and, over the course of what I am sure for all of them was a mystifying and deeply unsettling discussion, I presented my case that with the end of the Cold War, SAC's mission was essentially complete. I began to prepare them for a dramatic shift in strategic direction, to think in terms of less rather than more, to argue for smaller forces, fewer targets, reduced alert postures and accelerated arms control agreements.

This was a wrenching adjustment that prompted angry debate, bruised feelings and the early termination of a dozen promising careers. But in the end, my staff unanimously supported my decision to recommend that SAC itself be disestablished after 46 years at the nuclear ramparts.

But even this was only a beginning. My own prescription for what the United States should do now is detailed in the report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, established by the government of Australia in 1995, on which I served. The commission called not just for reductions in arms, but more importantly, for immediate, multilateral negotiations toward ending the most regrettable and risk-laden operational practice of the Cold War era: land- and sea-based ballistic missiles standing nuclear alert. But thoughtful debate about alternative agendas, while both urgent and essential, is not the most important priority for the American people.

What matters more is the defining question upon which the debate must ultimately turn: How should the United States see its responsibility for dealing with the conflicted moral legacy of the Cold War? Russia, with its history of authoritarian rule and a staggering burden of social transformation, is ill equipped to lead on this issue. It falls unavoidably to us to work painfully back through the tangled moral web of this frightful 50-year gantlet, born of the hellish confluence of two unprecedented historical currents: the bipolar collision of ideology and the unleashing of the power of the atom.

As a democracy, the consequences of these cataclysmic forces confronted us with a tortuous and seemingly inextricable dilemma: how to put at the service of our national survival a weapon whose sheer destructiveness was antithetical to the very values upon which our society was based? Over time, as arsenals multiplied on both sides and the rhetoric of mutual annihilation grew more heated, we were forced to think about the unthinkable, justify the unjustifiable, rationalize the irrational. Ultimately, we contrived a new and desperate theology to ease our moral anguish, and we called it deterrence.

I spent much of my military career serving the ends of deterrence, as did millions of others. I want very much to believe that it was the nuclear force that I and others commanded and operated that prevented World War III and created the conditions leading to the collapse of the Soviet empire. But, in truth, I do not and I cannot know that it was. It will be decades before the hideously complex era of the Cold War is adequately understood, with its bewildering interactions of human fears and inhuman technology.

It would not matter much that informed assessments are still well beyond our intellectual reach -- except for the crucial and alarming fact that we continue to espouse deterrence as if it were now an infallible panacea. And worse, other nations are listening, have converted to our theology, are building their arsenals, are poised to rekindle the nuclear arms race -- and to reawaken the specter of nuclear war.

What a stunning, perverse turn of events. In the words of my friend, Jonathan Schell, we face the dismal prospect that ""The Cold War was not the apogee of the age of nuclear weapons, to be succeeded by an age of nuclear disarmament. Instead, it may well prove to have simply been a period of initiation, in which not only Americans and Russians, but Indians and Pakistanis, Israelis and Iraqis, were adapting to the horror of threatening the deaths of millions of people, were learning to think about the unthinkable. If this is so, will history judge that the Cold War proved only a sort of modern-day Trojan Horse, whereby nuclear weapons were smuggled into the life of the world, made an acceptable part of the way the world works? Surely not, surely we still comprehend that to threaten the deaths of tens of hundreds of millions of people presages an atrocity beyond anything in the record of mankind? Or have we, in a silent and incomprehensible moral revolution, come to regard such threats as ordinary -- as normal and proper policy for any self-respecting nation.""

This cannot be the moral legacy of the Cold War. And it is our responsibility to ensure that it will not be.

About Gen. Butler

A 1961 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, George Lee Butler served in numerous flying and staff positions before becoming the director for strategic plans and policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In January 1991 Butler attained the rank of general and became the commander in chief of the Strategic Air Command and subsequently commander in chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, located at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. In these jobs he helped in the revision of U.S. nuclear war-fighting plans. Hewas a candidate to succeed Colin Powell as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1994 but was not selected. He retired in February 1994 at the age of 54.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,60,105,1997,0.777351527,0.68379798,29.2729825,31.704494
"Rowny, Edward",1979,1,1997-04-23,1,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Yes to the Chemical Weapons Accord,The Chemical Weapons Convention now up for vote is in the US national interest and should be ratified…I urge the U.S. Senate to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.,"The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) comes up for a crucial vote tomorrow. The CWC has been intensively negotiated on both sides of the congressional aisle and between the administration and Congress. The result is a new treaty that is acceptable to many and in my view should be acceptable to all former opponents. It would be unfortunate if the CWC were made a litmus test of the ideology of any political faction. Such tests should be reserved for matters that do not affect our national security or endanger the lives of our troops and citizens. The Chemical Weapons Convention now up for a vote is in the U.S. national interest and should be ratified.

In 1979 I resigned in protest over the SALT II treaty because it did not meet the criteria of a good arms-control agreement. An arms-control agreement must be effectively verifiable, not be fatally flawed, not contain provisions that prevent defenses, be enforceable and be in the interest of all parties -- but above all, in the interest of the United States.

The CWC is not effectively verifiable. However, the verification of any chemical weapons treaty is more difficult than a strategic arms treaty, under which missiles, submarines and bombers can be observed by national technical means. Chemical weapons can be produced in thousands of laboratories around the world. Therefore, no chemical weapons treaty can be 100 percent verifiable. If we are within the CWC, well-trained and experienced American inspectors, employing an agreed set of approved, intensiveprocedures, will have an opportunity to catch violators. Outside the CWC, no such opportunity will exist.

I was initially concerned with two flaws in the CWC: the prohibition of tear gas in combat and Article 10, which could require us to provide information on chemical weapons defenses to signatory rogue states, either directly or indirectly. However, through negotiation, these two flaws have been fixed. Under the revised CWC, tear gas will be permitted in combat and Article 10 will be interpreted by the United States in a way that does not obligate us to share defensive secrets.

In the past we have been overconfident that no nation would use chemical weapons against us. When the chemical threat materialized during the gulf war, the United States was forced to borrow detection equipment, protected vehicles and decontamination equipment from the United Kingdom, Germany and the Czech Republic.

Nothing in the CWC prevents us from building effective defenses. However, the greatest danger of this treaty arises from a false sense of security that might inhibit us from building such defenses. To correct this deficiency, the administration has recently pledged $225 million to provide additional chemical weapons defenses, and it is important that Congress fund these programs. Additionally, the United States should protect troops in combat and its citizens at home from the growing threat of ballistic missiles armed with chemical, biological or nuclear warheads. Finally, we should devote greater attention to providing defenses against domestic and foreign terrorists.

No arms-control treaty can stand alone. The United States must have the capability and will to take action against violators who would resort to chemical warfare. We must not again look the other way as we did when Iraq attacked Iran with poison gas, nor should we be silent in such instances as when the Iraqis attacked defenseless Kurds with chemical weapons. Chemical weapons are often referred to as the ""poor man's atom bombs."" The CWC will assist us in enforcing nonproliferation of chemical weaponsand help rid the world of the scourge of chemical attacks.

By ratifying the CWC, the United States allies itself with the world's civilized nations and not the pariahs. Ratification will give us the high moral ground and establish norms and standards for others to follow. U.S. ratification of the CWC will also remove the excuse of the Russian Duma and other parliaments that say they will not ratify the CWC until the United States does so.

The CWC will come into force internationally on April 29 whether or not the United States ratifies it. The bottom line must answer this question: Will the United States be better off with the CWC or without it? It is my conviction that the benefits outweigh the risks. However, I must emphasize that we should not be overly optimistic about the effectiveness of the CWC. Ratification must be accompanied by a commitment to defend ourselves and enforce the treaty. With this in mind, I urge the U.S. Senateto ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.

"Odom, William",1988,1,1997-07-06,1,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,A look at Expanding Nato; History Tells Us the Alliance Should Grow,"No great strategic departure is without risks, and enlarging NATO has some…likewise, there are risks in not going forward, for that too is a strategic departure - backward from Europe.","Enlarging NATO is the last major strategic challenge confronting America in the 20th century. Previously in the century, this nation has failed to meet only one: keeping the peace in Europe after World War I. Will it fail a second time? The two cases are disturbingly analogous: Many American political leaders are again obsessed with domestic issues, refusing to recognize their inextricable ties to security affairs and misunderstanding the new forces in Europe.

America withdrew from Europe after World War I, leaving a belt of new democracies, the so-called ""successor states,"" extending from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. France, Britain, Germany and the Soviet Union soon entangled them in competing alliances. Although they all began as democracies, by the mid-1930s all but one were dictatorships. These developments ensured another war.

History does not repeat itself, but structural continuities often prompt similar political developments. That is why the period between the two world wars is so instructive today. The critics insist that NATO can survive without enlargement. In the short term, they are right, but the longer-term dynamics would inevitably fracture the alliance. Maintaining the status quo is a sure formula for bringing about U.S. withdrawal from Europe. Confronted by strong forces of change, NATO will either enlarge tomoderate them or be broken by them. And the key to moderating them is Germany, not Russia.

Managing the emergence of German power peacefully has been the major problem in 20th-century Europe. Not only did German leaders fail in 1914, other European leaders share the blame. The resulting Great War produced the Soviet problem, the Nazis and a new war, the bloodiest in history.

After 1945, the United States rectified its earlier mistake, remaining engaged in Europe to resist Soviet expansion. As the rationale for NATO, however, the German problem loomed larger for most Europeans than the Soviet threat, especially for the French. NATO proved surprisingly effective in nurturing a new Germany as well as containing Soviet power, but today the Soviet threat is gone while the German problem is not entirely resolved. German leaders understand this reality well, and that is why theystrongly support NATO enlargement. They seek to bind Germany within an integrated Europe as a way to avoid a return to their old predicament.

The European Union's (EU) goal of a ""common foreign and defense policy,"" therefore, is conceived as a lasting solution to the German problem. Its realization, however, remains far from complete as the EU faces the changes caused by the end of the Cold War. In the absence of a multilateral mechanism incorporating Central Europe, competitive policies toward that region will be pursued unilaterally by Germany, France, Britain, Russia and others. (A reappearance of the interwar patterns of diplomacy was evident in the Europeans' reaction to the breakup of Yugoslavia. Finally, NATO forces were required to restore peace in Bosnia.) Thus, Central Europe will again become the scene of some, if not all, of the perverse dynamics of the interwar period unless NATO enlarges to preempt them.

Suppose the United States had followed the advice of the critics and rejected NATO enlargement. Could NATO survive the dynamics of the competition among its key members that would follow? Some argue that the EU could moderate them. But that is unpersuasive in light of the obstacles confronting the EU's adoption of a single currency, not to mention a common defense and foreign policy. Actually, Central Europe presents the EU with a paralyzing dilemma: to ""widen"" or to ""deepen"" its integration process?Widening into Central Europe would delay the deepening of existing political and military integration; deepening would leave Central Europe as a zone of diplomatic competition, endangering the EU process itself. Why? Germany.

Britain and France, which were already uncomfortable with a federal Europe that included a strong but divided Germany, are more nervous about a unified Germany bound to be the federation's dominant component. Without a federal Europe, they will be tempted to engage Central Europe against Germany, a game that will invite the most mischievous diplomacy by Moscow. The only viable way out is through NATO enlargement -- that is, engaging NATO in the same role in Central Europe that it has long played within Western Europe.

The opponents of enlargement wring their hands about Russia, financial costs and other problems while ignoring the crucially important German problem, no matter that German politicians from all parties warn against leaving Germany on its own to deal with the East.

To be sure, NATO enlargement will cause problems, but its opponents focus mainly on the manageable ones. They usually exaggerate the financial costs. So, too, Russia's probable reaction. The venerable Russia expert George Kennan warns that expansion will destroy Russian democracy. Why would Russia give up democracy to spite NATO? That would harm Russia, not NATO. Actually, Russia has very little ""liberal"" democracy to destroy. Civil and property rights do not yet enjoy effective protection in Russia.NATO enlargement will undercut those neoimperialist Russian politicians who oppose it and who also misrepresent Russian public attitudes toward it as reflected in polling data. Moreover, proponents of enlargement also urge a continuing and broad Western engagement with Russia, not its isolation.

Other problems, however, are serious, especially the reactions of those countries denied membership in the first round. Their plight demands effective attention -- foremost, credible assurance that NATO enlargement is a continuing process, not a one-time affair. An active policy of continuing engagement with each is equally essential.

New members will also cause problems. Some may have embarrassing political scandals involving former Communists and KGB connections. Some may falter in their democratic transitions. NATO, of course, has already coped with such problems in some present member states.

Finally, some critics doubt the administration's competence to carry through NATO enlargement. The president has yet to make the case effectively to the public, and some European leaders believe they are being treated poorly (in French President Jacques Chirac's quaint language, ""like crap"") in the consultation process. This is worrisome, not just where it concerns Senate ratification but also realities in Europe. When the president told the public that American credibility was at stake if we did notcommit troops to the NATO force in Bosnia, he also set an early date for their withdrawal, thereby undermining implementation of the Dayton accord. How can the United States, then, have sufficient credibility in Europe for carrying through on NATO enlargement if it walks away from Bosnia before peace is secure? Success in Bosnia is related to NATO enlargement. Fortunately, the administration evaded the one-year deadline, but the secretary of defense now calls for a pullout next year. Also, President Clinton's occasional remarks on reducing NATO's military essence -- for example, after his recent meeting with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia -- do not reflect clear thinking about what is required for Partnership for Peace activities, Bosnia and other potential military operations. This is hardly reassuring U.S. leadership.

No great strategic departure is without risks, and enlarging NATO has some, as its opponents abundantly point out. Likewise, there are risks in not going forward, for that, too, is a strategic departure -- backward from Europe.

The reunification of Germany within NATO is the greatest strategic realignment in Europe's history without a major war, an achievement no pundit would have conceded beforehand to be possible. But that is only half of the task. Consolidating a community of liberal democracies in Central Europe and beyond is the more difficult half. Failure would eventually affect America's own economy and security adversely, not to mention the negative political and moral consequences. Is America worthy of its liberty andprosperity if it no longer dares to accept such challenges with energy and optimism?

The Air Force Memorial would not intrude on the Iwo Jima memorial.,"The attack on the Air Force Memorial by Gilbert Stockman and George Salamon in ""Close to Home"" on Sept. 14 was off-base. The Air Force Memorial would not intrude on the Iwo Jima memorial, which is at a higher elevation and more than 500 feet away from the proposed site. A stand of mature trees also would provide a screen.
The Air Force Memorial would not ""dwarf"" the Iwo Jima memorial either. The Marine Corps War Memorial occupies seven of the 25 acres of the Nevius Tract north of Arlington Cemetery. The Air Force Memorial site would be two acres, within which the memorial itself would stand on only 6,500 square feet. The Iwo Jima memorial is 78 feet high; the Air Force Memorial would be 50 feet high.
Salamon's charge that an Air Force memorial would become ""just one more thing not to miss in the area's supermarket of heroism products"" is a gratuitous insult to the men and women who have fought and served in the U.S. Air Force and its predecessor organizations. Equally unpalatable is Stockman's glib dismissal of the fact that, as The Post observed, the Air Force Memorial Foundation had ""jumped through the necessary hoops in its five-year campaign to create a memorial.""
This is not a trivial matter, and the foundation did not establish the rules and process by which monuments are reviewed and approved. Congress did. The foundation meticulously followed the process prescribed in law by Congress in 1986 and satisfied all of the requirements imposed by the National Park Service, the National Capital Memorial Commission, the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts.
The Air Force Memorial Foundation invested five years of effort in the project, raising some $13 million from individuals and groups who pledged their support with the understanding that it was for an approved memorial design concept on an approved site.
None of this was done in secret. The senior leadership of the Marine Corps raised no objection when informed of the plan in 1994, before approval for the Arlington Ridge site was requested. The neighborhood group called ""Friends of Iwo Jima"" was not formed to oppose the Air Force Memorial until April. Spokesmen for the group say they did not know about the project until recently -- somehow they missed coverage of the design approval that was in the media in March of 1996.
When the Marine Corps sought a site for its memorial some 40 years ago, many objected to the original site at Hains Point. Critics worried that the Iwo Jima statue would overwhelm the view, deprive the community of parkland, cause parking problems and disrupt the skyline. The right to situate the memorial at its present location was disputed by supporters of other monuments who felt they had better and previous claims.

"McFarlane, Robert",,0,1998-05-30,1,0,0,NYT,Marine Corps ,,,M,Pakistan's Catch-22,"…We must out forward and lead a serious agenda of arms control. Separate, but related, is the enduring need to assure the security of the weakest member in the region, Pakistan…","Ten days ago, in a long session with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, I found him sobered and deeply
anguished by the choices before him.
In addition to the obvious nuclear catastrophe that could occur if Pakistan's armed confrontation with India in
Kashmir got out of control, he understood quite well the ruinous economic impact that a nuclear arms race with
India could have on his country, which already spends 70 percent of the national budget on defense and debt
service. Worse, however, would be for Pakistan to be subjugated and ultimately dismembered by the nationalistled,
fanatically anti-Muslim Government in India, which with each day's rhetoric has seemed devoted to that very
course.
Mr. Sharif wanted desperately to find a way to deter India. Yet unless he received concrete security assurances
from the United States and/or China -- a firm commitment to respond jointly to any Indian attack upon Pakistan -- he
would have no choice but to respond in kind to India's nuclear tests. The only way he could compensate for India's
lopsided advantage in conventional forces would be by relying on nuclear weapons -- as the NATO alliance did visa-
vis the Soviet Union for 40 years in Europe.
Not wanting to embarrass his American guest, Mr. Sharif asked obliquely, ""Do you think China would give us a
security guarantee?"" I replied that I doubted it, and, going on to answer his implied question, I said that for the
United States to do so would require a far greater understanding among Americans and in the Congress of the
stakes involved.
I added that about as much as he could hope for in the short term would be a commitment from President Clinton to
begin working immediately with him on a joint security policy that could lead to the kind of assurance he was
seeking. In his exchanges with President Clinton since then, he sought that kind of commitment. Apparently he
didn't believe he received it.
Yes, this crisis could have been avoided, with outside intervention. To be fair, however, the failure to prevent it lies
with leaders of both of our political parties, who have never wanted to invest the time and energy required to
mediate the well-known disagreements between India and Pakistan. Instead, by default, American policy has been
Page 2 of 3
Pakistan's Catch-22
forged by the Congress, which has put in place a nonsensical framework of sanctions -- of ""sticks"" alone -- while
offering no incentives for restraint or intellectual solutions to Pakistan's problems.
Ask yourself what you would do as Prime Minister of Pakistan, faced with an imbalance of at least 2-to-1 with India
in every measure of conventional power? You would seek a security guarantee from the United States or China
that, however ambiguous, might at least complicate Indian thinking before an attack. And if you couldn't get that,
you would ""go nuclear.""
Where do we go from here? First, looking to the wider audience of nuclear wannabes, we must make it clear that
India's prideful boasting of having joined the club of great powers is false and that there will be no rewards -- but
instead, severe pain -- for its unwarranted decision. We must make clear to the Indian Government that it is today
what it was two weeks ago, an arrogant, overreaching cabal that, by its devotion to the caste system, the political
and economic disenfranchisement of its people and its religious intolerance, is unworthy of membership in any club.
Concurrently, we should make clear that we welcome into the real club those nations, like Brazil and Argentina, that
have had the courage and good sense to forgo nuclear weapons and instead to focus on providing for their people.
Second, we should show some active, visible leadership. President Clinton should commit himself to a sustained
period of intense political, economic and security diplomacy with both sides.
It must focus first on a serious analysis of the precarious security situation in South Asia and the most volatile
source of current tension, the Kashmir dispute. In addition to offering to mediate that disagreement, the President
must focus on the root causes of poverty and unrest in both countries. That analysis could provide a basis for
convening an international donors group, including Japan, Germany, Britain, the World Bank and others, to begin --
finally -- to think seriously about the human misery in South Asia.
In parallel, we must put forward and lead a serious agenda of arms control. Separate, but related, is the enduring
need to assure the security of the weakest member in the region, Pakistan. But it is not beyond the wit of sensible
people who understand both the stakes and the awful history of the region to do so",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,64,105,1997,0.777351527,0.68379798,29.2729825,31.704494
"McFarlane, Robert",,0,1998-07-01,1,0,0,NYT,Marine corps,,,M,Risking Double Defeat: No Arms Treaty and Bad Arms,"Having spent the past year working with a bipartisan group of Congressional and former cabinet-level national security experts to define our strategic requirements, I believe a workable compromise can be forged….","'Democracies usually do the right thing - after exhausting all the other alternatives,'' Abba Eban tells us. Nowhere is
this more true than in the United States' efforts to modernize its land-based ICBM force, which after 12 long years
seem still in the ''exhausting'' phase.
This is a two-part problem: Unless we do the ''right thing'' now in deciding how to base our MX and Midgetman
missiles, the Senate may, properly, refuse to ratify the first treaty calling for reductions in strategic nuclear weapons,
which is being negotiated at Geneva.
Then the United States will end up with the worst of all worlds: first, a vulnerable intercontinental ballistic missile
force that could provide the incentive for a Soviet nuclear attack during a crisis; second, no treaty restraints on the
growth of Soviet strategic forces. We can avoid this outcome only if the people most involved - the defense
intellectuals in and out of Government who have helped formulate American strategy - will put aside petty
differences, overcome partisan impulses, acknowledge fiscal pressures and act in the national interest.
There is a sad irony in the history leading to today's state of affairs. From 1981 to 1985, when we had the money
and popular support for renewal of our strategic forces, the Pentagon's civilian leadership fumbled the opportunity
through ineptitude and hubris. Now that we have strong, effective leadership at the Pentagon, we no longer have
the money for sensible policies and programs.
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci would not be backing a plan to put MX missiles on railway cars on military bases
- the missiles would be vulnerable for hours before dispersal in a crisis, thus providing only an illusion of
survivability - if he could pay for a more survivable approach.
But instead of imagination and help, he is getting nothing but self-serving parochialism from the Air Force and
hypocritical cheap shots from former Ford and Carter Administration officials. Consider the following examples of
unworthy conduct that has occurred in recent weeks:
The Air Force has promoted a basing plan for the MX that it knows is vulnerable and destabilizing. The Air Force
would rather spend its traditional share of the military budget -a budget that is now declining - on aircraft.
Moreover, the Air Force - with help from the National Security Council staff -has had America's position at the
strategic arms talks modified to include an approach to verification that makes true mobility for land-based missiles
virtually impossible and phony mobility (on railway tracks) easier. This is not only intellectually dishonest and
militarily dangerous but also subverts the fundamental purpose of arms control: to foster a more stable military
balance.

Risking Double Defeat: No Arms Treaty and Bad Arms
Further, a chorus of Ford and Carter Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials who presided over the development of
multiple-warhead ICBM's and the Trident submarine, and who refused to insist that Moscow reduce the number of
its nuclear weapons out of concern that Moscow would find it non-negotiable, now say multiple-warhead missiles
are destabilizing, that Tridents present too inviting a target and reductions of warheads by both sides will make
things worse.
My point is not to criticize their former or current judgments. It is simply to say that now, when a 12-year effort to
resolve the ICBM modernization problem is on the verge of ending in failure, they, more than anyone, ought to
recognize what Mr. Carlucci is facing and try to contribute to a sensible consensus instead of throwing brickbats.
What am I calling for? First, a little less self-serving ''wisdom'' from the national security community - from experts
on Capitol Hill, in the Air Force and in private life - and, second, a little more good will.
It is clear that there is a consensus among these strategists on several basic points. It is also clear that if they would
acknowledge this consensus publicly, we could all forge a victory instead of heading toward double defeat on ICBM
modernization and the strategic arms treaty. And we could restore a measure of bipartisanship in the process.
Four basic beliefs that all these defense intellectuals accept privately, whatever they're saying publicly, are as
follows: 1. The 50 percent cuts being discussed at the strategic arms talks can leave us with a stable nuclear
balance if we are sensible in our ICBM modernization. 2. The Soviet Union's increasing nuclear capabilities make it
prudent for us to insure the survivability of our ICBM's through mobility by the year 2000 at the latest. 3. Moving
away from fixed multiple-warhead missiles and toward single-warhead mobile ones makes good sense. 4. We really
are short of cash today.
Agreement on these principles would open the door to a consensus on behalf of going ahead with a single-warhead
mobile Midgetman as soon as we can afford it, probably by the late 1990's. We must also make a commitment that
we will not do anything in the interim to make that goal more difficult, such as canceling the Midgetman, promoting
arms control positions that drive us toward vulnerable MX's on rails or foreclosing a sensible mobile Midgetman
deployment.
Having spent the past year working with a bipartisan group of Congressional and former Cabinet-level national
security experts to define our strategic requirements, I believe a workable compromise can be forged.
For that to happen, the Pentagon and Congress should sit down and start to reason together to avoid disaster.
Much of the current problem comes from the mistrust between the former Defense Secretary and the Congress
during his seven years in office. Now that Mr. Carlucci is on the job, and relations are improving, the relationship is
being repaired, money problems and election year nerves have intervened in the ICBM debate.
Even these obstacles can be overcome, but someone must take the first step - or maybe Secretary Carlucci and
Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, could sit down and try to reach a grand
compromise.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,64,105,1997,0.777351527,0.68379798,29.2729825,31.704494

How did so many observers overlook the warning signs? They saw promise instead of problems. Sure, they said, Russia's reform process was moving slowly, but it was on the right path. And yes, foreign investors seemed leery, but that was to be expected in a country making the transition from a controlled economy to a free market one. So when the Russian economy began its dramatic slide, it seemed only sensible in this atmosphere of optimism for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to put together a $22 billion rescue package.

Unfortunately, this rosy assessment is fundamentally wrong. Russia's economic difficulties cannot be overcome by confidence building measures or IMF loans. They cannot be solved merely by ending the rampant political corruption, fixing the failing banking system or putting teeth into the woefully weak tax collection system. The problems go much deeper: They require the building of fundamentally new economic, legal and governmental institutions as well as the demolition of lingering Soviet institutions.

A metaphor is perhaps the best way to describe the chaos that exists in Russia today. Think of the Russian economy as a professional football league. On game day, the teams arrive at their fields to play before sell-out crowds. The players look around to discover there are no referees. Nor is the field lined off to mark the boundaries, yard lines and goal lines. To get the games under way, each team's owner sends one of its own to officiate. Predictably, the referees only make calls favorable to theirteam. At half-time, gamblers send their agents to bribe the referees. The fans, knowing that skill doesn't determine the outcome, become unruly. Needless to say, the game turns into a melee. Meanwhile, most of the gate receipts disappear mysteriously and the players end up receiving no salaries.

This is a crude approximation of the way the Russian economy operates. The state authorities are not strong enough to impose order on the game. They cannot supply honest referees or dictate rules. They may write a regulatory system for the teams and the owners, but they cannot enforce it. Nor can they prevent thefts at the box office. And they cannot extract adequate fees from the owners to pay for all the necessary regulatory functions to manage the league through a season of play. Nonetheless, Western governments continue to act as if controlling legal institutions exist and that the rules are fair.

Much of the West's confusion arises from excessively optimistic reporting on the Yeltsin government's economic reforms. News accounts of the new Russian stock market, of the radical privatization program of 1993-94 and of the Russian efforts to bring inflation under control gave the impression that Russia is not much different from Indonesia or Mexico. Books and articles with titles such as ""How Russia Became a Market Economy"" only reinforced this misperception. The result has been a widespread conviction, particularly strong in both the State Department and the Congress, that Russia is headed in the right direction.

Was the Yeltsin-Gaidar government wrong-headed when it launched reforms in early 1992? Not really. Former prime minister Yegor Gaidar and his group were fairly realistic about the political resistance they faced, yet still brave enough to try. They probably believed that making it impossible to resurrect the old Soviet system was, in itself, an important success. To understand why, consider the obstacles they were up against:

* First, for nearly 70 years, the Soviet economic system had allocated capital investment by criteria that had nothing to do with the market. For decades, a huge portion of the industrial investment was spent on the military (more than 25 percent of the annual national income). There was no real system of prices to guide producers in making efficient investments. When the Yeltsin regime decided to introduce a market system and make the ruble a convertible currency, it didn't have a prayer that its industrial base could compete internationally or meet Russian consumer demands for goods and services.

It was easy to see that almost none of the newly privatized industrial firms could turn a profit, even in the hands of practiced and competent managers. To avoid the massive bankruptcy that would undoubtedly have occurred if true competition had existed in the industrial sector, the Yeltsin government used a mix of expanding the money supply and refusing to pay state workers' wages--first in one sector, then in another, continually shifting to stay ahead of the political pressures.

In the case of much of the military sector and some of the large civilian industrial firms, the government periodically grants credits to prevent bankruptcy. The firms themselves stave off the inevitable by refusing to pay their debts. When state wage payments, credits or foreign investments become available, managers often steal much of the money designated for salaries. This massive game of musical chairs has been going on since 1992. But each time the music stops, and one of the chairs is taken away, the IMF and Western bankers have come in to pay the band so the music can start once more.

* Second, the controlling legal institutions mentioned earlier have not been created. For all the talk about privatization of industry--more than 77 percent of mid-size and large firms, and 82 percent of smaller ones--private property laws are non-existent or inadequate. Although the Russian constitution states that private property is a right, in practice no one is allowed to own land. Citizens may own apartments and country dachas, but they do not have a clear, registered title to the land on which thebuildings stand.

Ownership of stock is similarly shaky. Shares are registered only within the firm. While many regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have been adopted to impress Western investors, they are not followed. Civil and commercial courts are concepts still in their infancy. To fill the gap, private security firms have sprung up, providing services to businesses who want to settle contract disputes.

The banks, of course, are not really ""banks"" in the Western sense. The Russian Central Bank does not provide a regulatory service like the U.S. Federal Reserve system, the Treasury and other agencies. We know that the sophisticated U.S. banking regulations were not created overnight, and that some bankers still exploit the system at taxpayers' expense when loopholes permit, as we saw in the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.

* Third, consider how daunting the Russian government's fiscal policy challenge is. The tax system is arbitrary, primitive and corrupt. A state's capacity to tax--especially to collect income taxes--is perhaps the best single indicator of strength and legitimacy. By this measure, Russia is an extremely weak state, something that is likely to continue for the next 10 or 20 years.

The weak-state syndrome is a trap. Once in it, states seldom extract themselves. They simply move from one fiscal crisis to another. A sense of Russia's fiscal problems comes from employment data. Despite the privatization of industry, only 27 million of Russia's 67 million workers are in the private sector. The state is still responsible for the paychecks of 40 million people. How can the government afford to pay so many salaries? The enterprises under state control--including much of the military-industrial sector and all the collective farms--are notoriously unprofitable. And Russian tax receipts certainly won't cover the government's costs.

* Fourth, no matter how much foreign capital flows into Russia, the record to date shows that about the same amount takes flight abroad. This, of course, is primarily a symptom of the other problems afflicting the Russian economy. But it does show why providing more foreign aid to Russia doesn't make much sense.

What are the policy implications of these realities? The United States and Europe can do very little to help Russia, and most of what they have been doing has exacerbated the problems. By recognizing the limits of what they can do, Washington and the European capitals will leave the true culprits to take the blame: Russian leaders at all levels.

We must shift away from our obsession with creating a democracy in Russia and put our emphasis on creating a liberal political system--that is, a system that limits the state's power and that guarantees citizens' private property and civil rights. Their rights are tenuous today, the result of a feckless police force and weak courts. These things are as important to Russians' freedom and economic prosperity as periodic elections. Only when such rights exist will it be possible to talk about effective monetary and fiscal policies in Russia.

uneasiness is now being voiced in both houses of Congress, where a bipartisan group of key members has called
upon President Clinton to increase defense spending beginning with the next budget submission, in January
1999. The president, who told a recent gathering of top military brass that ""readiness must be our No. 1 priority,""
ought to heed that call.
I have proposed that defense spending be increased to $300 billion a year from its current $250 billion. This
would enable the armed forces to fulfill their ever-expanding list of commitments, provide for a moderate
modernization program and enhance the quality of life of our service members and their families. More
importantly, a larger budget will help solve the manpower shortage that urgently threatens the nation's military
preparedness.
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the end of the draft, a major milestone for both the nation and its armed
forces. Despite a rough start that lasted until the early 1980s, the volunteer force has been a remarkable success.
Desert Storm provided a showcase for what a superbly trained and well-equipped force can do. The major lesson
learned in the Gulf was not that American weapons were superior to Iraqi weapons -- although clearly they were
-- but that our volunteers were superior to their conscripts.
Yet quality servicemen can't be taken for granted. Today's armed forces have to vie for employees in the national
labor market, and that market is increasingly competitive. Recruiters have to overcome some obvious objections
to military service, including the demands of entry training, potentially hazardous duty, uncommon privacy
limitations and increasingly frequent family separation because of deployments to distant and desolate places. To
compensate, the armed forces have learned to market themselves by appealing to the unique features of military
life: a rewarding and important experience, valuable training, a sense of belonging, housing and medical care,
adequate compensation and -- the major draw -- an opportunity to save for college. But all of these inducements
are fast becoming less attractive.
The Air Force and the Navy have failed to meet their recruiting goals for the current fiscal year. The Army has
been more successful, but only because its recruiting objective was significantly lowered and because it will likely
pull forward some enlistees into late 1998 who were previously contracted to come aboard in early 1999.
Numerous factors have combined to complicate the recruiting campaign. Starting with the Navy's Tailhook
scandal, the military has suffered a steady barrage of bad publicity. But the real explanation is the impressive
performance of the economy.
Unemployment among 16- to 19-year-olds -- the major source of new recruits -- is lower today than it was in
January 1973, the first month of the volunteer force. Within this demographic group, unemployment during the
1970s and '80s averaged about 18%; it is now 13%. Potential recruits are clearly taking advantage of other
opportunities, as well as a growing list of programs, both public and private, providing funding for college. It
doesn't help that there is now a 14% gap between military and civilian pay.
Recruiting has been further hampered by a numerical decline in the prime recruiting market: those between 17
and 21 who are high school graduates not immediately bound for college, are physically fit and test in the upper
half of a standardized entry examination. This population now consists of fewer than 850,000 people -- 15% fewer
than in the mid-1980s.

In an effort to deal with this increasingly tight and competitive labor market, the Army and the Navy have been
forced to increase the number of field recruiters by a third over the past three years. But since the services
operate within a legislatively capped strength, an increase in recruiters results in a decrease in soldiers and
sailors. This diversion has contributed to frequent complaints from field commanders that units are undermanned.
No one wants to return to the draft. Military commanders prefer high-quality volunteers to mixed-quality draftees.
Certainly there are merits in requiring some form of service by American youth, but painful past experience
highlighted the difficulty of crafting a fair, equitable process of selecting those who would serve. Political leaders
do not want to face such a widely unpopular prospect again. But neither can the nation avoid its role as the
world's sole superpower, unless it is willing to accept the greater risks associated with a more isolationist foreign
policy.
Steps must immediately be taken to enhance the competitiveness of the armed forces in the labor market. This
means that we must first stop the steady decline of the defense budget in both absolute terms and as a portion of
our gross domestic product. Current levels of defense spending are not well calibrated to support our force
structure, which itself is not well calibrated to support our national strategy.
We must also close the current pay gap, increase retirement and health benefits, and reduce the burden on our
forces, which over the past few years have been asked to do too much, too often, with too little. The armed
services will have to develop a new set of incentives attractive to recruits going beyond those that saved the
volunteer-force concept in the late 1970s. Beyond that, investments must be made in currently underfunded
modernization programs that over the next two decades will allow us to develop and field a military force that is
less labor-intensive than it is today.
Even if defense spending were raised to $300 billion, it would still be historically small as a percentage of either
the GDP or the federal budget. The major reason for reducing defense spending after the Cold War was the need
to reduce the federal budget deficit. Our robust economic performance has now erased the deficit and given us a
healthy surplus, allowing us to pay our defense bill. It would be a grievous breach of duty if, out of sheer neglect,
we failed to do so.",10,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,64,105,1997,0.777351527,0.68379798,29.2729825,31.704494
"Mcdonough, James",,1,1998-09-28,1,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Clinton's Contempt for U.S. Soldiers,"I do not know what constitues a high crime or misdemeanor. I suspect, however, that had American soldiers been killed…President Clinton would have been guilty of one or the other. ","During the summer and fall of 1995, U.S. military forces -- the bulk of them forward deployed in Europe -- trained for operations in Bosnia. The original mission was to rescue, if necessary, United Nations forces from Grazde, a city then hotly contested by Serbs and Muslims. When that city fell without U.S. intercession, focus shifted to the equally threatened cities of Zepa and Srebrenica.

Substantial forces were earmarked for the planned operation. Throughout the summer they rehearsed their missions dozens of times, over distances that replicated the depth of the mission. The majority of the full dress rehearsals included live fire under conditions of darkness, various degrees of simulated challenges from warring parties, civilian panic, and the confusion that stems from hundreds of moving parts, troops and machines. Nonetheless, the troops were ready and confident. I know because I was their leader, the force commander who would lead them in and take them out.

Implicit in our faith and confidence was the presumption that we would be committed only with the careful consideration and wisdom of our national decision makers. Our faith in them, and in ourselves, was unshakable. In the end, elements of the force (at that point detached from my command) were committed to Bosnia as the spearhead of the U.S. Army's entry into Tuzla in December 1995. Never did any of us doubt that our commander-in-chief had acted in full recognition of his obligations.

As it turns out, on at least one occasion during his deliberations in 1995, President Clinton might not have had his mind fully on the enormous responsibilities he was incurring by putting U.S. troops in harm's way. According to the Starr report, during a phone call to Rep. H. L. ""Sonny"" Callahan (R., Ala.) on Nov. 17 to secure his vote against an attempt to deny funds to commit troops to Bosnia, the president was simultaneously receiving sexual favors from Monica Lewinsky.

Perhaps this is just a salacious detail in an otherwise rational decision making process. Perhaps the phone call to Rep. Callahan was inconsequential and can be disregarded in the overall scheme of things (the congressman did support the president in the House vote, the only Alabama Republican to do so).

But it nonetheless saddens the heart to learn that President Clinton, during this one moment at least, was arguing for sending America's armed forces into potential danger even as he must have been significantly distracted. We had demanded of the soldiers and airmen involved that they pay meticulous attention to detail lest their lack of vigilance compromise the safety and well-being of any of them. We never doubted we were getting similar focus from the highest levels.

To be certain, no one expects a leader -- even one as important as the president of the United States -- to be ""on watch"" all the time. All human beings, if they are to remain in balance, must go through alternating cycles of work and relaxation. In this case, however, the act of casual sex at a moment of great importance smacks of callous indifference, sophomoric arrogance, and reckless disregard of the sanctity of U.S. soldiers' lives.

Perhaps at all other moments the president gave his undivided attention to the enormity of the decision at hand. In this instance he apparently did not. I am glad that his uniformed subordinates did not know it at the time. His behavior was so bizarre and contemptuous of their stake in the matter that it might have shaken their trust in their commander in chief.

For much of my life I was a professional soldier. I make no pretense of being a lawyer. I do not know what constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor. I suspect, however, that had American soldiers been killed because of their ill-considered commitment to action, President Clinton would have been guilty of one or the other.

Again and again, he has rattled the sword he knows not how to yield, and he has claimed victories when nothing has been achieved. ","I t wasn't Saddam Hussein who blinked last weekend, it was President Clinton. With combat aircraft finally poised to strike Iraq, the president clutched at another of Saddam's teasers and called off the attack. Then Mr. Clinton wondered if he had done the right thing and re-started the attack cycle, only to break off a second effort when offered a few more form-letter-from-Baghdad promises. In doing so, the president, like a country boy facing a card sharp, fell for the tired old con game yet again, and missed what might have been his best opportunity to break the cycle of frustration in dealing with Iraq.

For once, we had global support or acquiescence for military action. The time was right. But Mr. Clinton's resolve failed him. Reportedly, there was some debate among the president's senior advisors prior to the final military stand-down, but it can only have been superficial. The White House claims that the deciding factor was the likelihood of 10,000 Iraqi deaths, which Mr. Clinton feared would turn world opinion against the U.S.


Perhaps, at some opportune moment, one of our military leaders should summon the courage to explain to Mr. Clinton that deaths do tend to occur in military operations and that, before threatening the use of force, the president might want to consider that unpleasant reality. Warfare kills people and destroys objects. The dream of ""bloodless war"" remains just that. Contrary to the nonsense droned out by Washington think tanks--perhaps the most inappropriately termed institutions in history--the application of military power remains an equation of flesh and blood and destruction.

But there is even more at stake here than another botched go-round with Iraq. Mr. Clinton has sent signals of cowardice and irresolution not only to Saddam but to warlords, demagogues and captains of terror everywhere. Not only is the administration reluctant to risk its own military personnel, it worries about hurting its enemies. On a brutally practical level, those anticipated Iraqi casualties would have occurred because so many of Iraq's sensitive sites are now in or near urban areas. We have just told the world that this strategy of surrounding military targets with humanity--turning your own citizens into hostages--works against the greatest military power in history. This undercuts all the hyper-expensive military might of the U.S. armed forces.

The White House claim that the risk of enemy casualties deterred our strike, meant to sound humane, will only further accelerate the urbanization of warfare, for which our nation and our military remains determinedly unprepared. When we are finally forced to fight, in Iraq or elsewhere, the death toll and attendant destruction will be far higher than it might have been had Mr. Clinton found the courage to match his rhetoric with action.

President Clinton is the problem. Again and again, he has rattled the sword he knows not how to wield, and he has claimed victories when nothing has been achieved. Surrounded by close advisers whose sheltered, privileged lives left them unprepared to deal with foreign leaders who will lie and cheat shamelessly to survive, who will sacrifice their own people to extend their grip on power, and who will kill without concern, Mr. Clinton has taken us the final step into the age of wonks vs. warlords, of the weak-willed and comfortable vs. the ruthless and determined. Guess who is going to win this bar fight?

Many other points might be made, from the woeful lack of military experience in the inner circles of the Clinton administration, to its substitution of disparate infatuations and class prejudices for an integrated foreign policy. But all such matters are secondary to the problem of a president for whom opinion polls are the only sure guide to decisionmaking, for whom safety is ever more important than achievement, and for whom nothing is really worth fighting for.",5,Warfighting,,1,,,,The author strongly criticizes the Presdent's actions regarding Iraq. ,64,105,1997,0.777351527,0.68379798,23.2628297,34.056846
"Studeman, W.O.; Shapiro, Sumner; Butts, J.L.; Brooks, T.A.",,1,1998-12-12,1,0,0,WaPO,Navy,,,M,Release Pollard at the Nation's Peril,"In today's multi-polar world, where the threat of international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are constant concerns, intelligence and security cooperation with friendly nations is essential. Anything that causes our friends to be reluctant to share intelligence with us could severely damage our national security.","Jonathan Pollard is serving a life sentence for stealing massive amounts of highly classified and extremely sensitive U.S. national security information. In terms of sheer volume of sensitive information betrayed, Jonathan Pollard rivals any of the traitors who have plagued this nation in recent times. Nobody is clamoring for the release of traitors like Aldrich Ames, John Walker or Jerry Whitworth, but Pollard, by manipulating his supporters and conducting a clever public relations campaign both hereand in Israel, has managed to generate a small but vocal movement advocating that he be released and allowed to emigrate to Israel, where he expects to be something of a national hero.

We, who are painfully familiar with the case, feel obligated to go on record with the facts regarding Pollard in order to dispel the myths that have arisen from this clever public relations campaign aimed at transforming Pollard from greedy, arrogant betrayer of the American national trust into Pollard, committed Israeli patriot.

Pollard pleaded guilty and therefore never was publicly tried. Thus, the American people never came to know that he offered classified information to three other countries before working for the Israelis and that he offered his services to a fourth country while he was spying for Israel. They also never came to understand that he was being very highly paid for his services -- including an impressive nest egg currently in foreign banks -- and was negotiating with his Israeli handlers for a raise as hewas caught. So much for Jonathan Pollard, ideologue!

Pollard and his apologists argue that he turned over to the Israelis information that they were being denied and that was critical to their security. The fact is that Pollard had no way of knowing what the Israeli government was receiving by way of official intelligence exchange agreements. He himself does not even know the full extent of his betrayal, since he stole entire files and databases and never took the time to examine the suitcase-loads of material he was turning over. Some of the data he compromised had nothing to do with Israeli security or even with the Middle East. He betrayed worldwide intelligence data, including sources and methods developed at significant cost to the U.S. taxpayer. As a result of his perfidy, some of those sources are lost forever.

Another claim that is heard is that the U.S. government somehow reneged on its bargain not to seek the life sentence. What is not heard is that Pollard's part of this bargain was to cooperate fully in an assessment of the damage he had done and to refrain from talking to the press prior to the completion of the trial. He blatantly and contemptuously refused to live up to either part of the plea agreement, repeatedly lying and attempting to impede the government's damage assessment. It was this, coupled with the magnitude and consequences of his criminal actions, that resulted in the judge imposing a life sentence -- a sentence that was well-deserved, but that, true to its part of the plea bargain, the prosecution had never sought. The life sentence was subsequently upheld by the appellate court.

If, as Pollard and his supporters claim, he has ""suffered enough"" for his crimes, he is free to apply for parole as the American judicial system provides. In his arrogance, he has refused to do so, but instead insists on being granted clemency or a pardon.

A presidential grant of clemency or pardon in this or any other espionage case -- regardless of the foreign government involved and irrespective of the claimed ideological motivation -- would be totally irresponsible from a national security standpoint. It would send a most damaging message to the loyal U.S. citizens who are entrusted with our national secrets, many of whom have emotional ties to other nations but who, nonetheless, have taken seriously their oath to keep our national security information secret.

It also would say to foreign governments, ""Your secrets are not safe with us."" In today's multi-polar world, where the threat of international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are constant concerns, intelligence and security cooperation with friendly foreign nations is essential. Anything that causes our friends to be reluctant to share intelligence with us could severely damage our national security.

George Tenet, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is to be commended for courageously interceding to stop the hurried move to release Pollard as part of the Wye negotiations. Too much is at stake to let a man like Pollard go without the thoughtful, fact-based review process our legal system provides. We appeal to the president to listen to his national security community and, above all, to ensure that the facts of the Pollard case are known and that the potential long-term implications of hisrelease are fully considered before any decisions are made.

That, rather than soldiers' low opinions of the president's character, should be cause for concern. ","In the ranks of the military, the impeachment crisis has evoked scattered grumbling, an echo of the civil-military tensions with which the Clinton era began. In truth, most American soldiers don't much like their commander in chief. In their eyes he remains the ""draft dodger"" whose efforts to avoid service in Vietnam were plainly dishonorable. In contrast to the ethic of selflessness, self-discipline and honor to which they aspire, the president's recklessly self-indulgent personal life and his weaseling efforts to avoid responsibility for his actions cannot be anything but offensive.

Then there is the question of double standards. Beginning with the notorious Navy Tailhook convention of 1991 and continuing through the pending matter of retired Army Maj. Gen. David Hale, charged with having had extramarital affairs, the services have been shaken by a series of high-profile cases involving sexual misconduct by senior commissioned and noncommissioned officers. The outcome in almost every instance so far has been the end of a career. Although bearing only passing resemblance to ""the Lewinsky matter,"" these cases have convinced some in the military that, if only as a matter of fairness, the commander in chief should suffer the same consequences.

Yet the sporadic mutterings of a few angry colonels or retired flag officers notwithstanding, impeachment and the looming prospect of a Senate trial are unlikely to affect President Clinton's standing as commander of the armed forces. Americans need not worry about overt military insubordination or dissent. The president's authority will remain intact.

That prospect is at once reassuring and worrisome. Reassuring, because deference to a president whom soldiers hold in low regard affirms that the fundamental principle of civilian control remains deeply ingrained. Worrisome, because that formal deference conceals the fact that the president's real authority is exercised--and modified--through a complex and ambiguous process. The dirty little secret of American civil-military relations, by no means unique to this administration, is that the commander in chief does not command the military establishment; he cajoles it, negotiates with it, and, as necessary, appeases it.

Clinton's painful initiation into this reality came at the very outset of his first term. Announcing his intention to overturn the prohibition on homosexuals serving in the armed forces, Clinton in early 1993 provoked an unusual outburst of military protest. Liquidating that unseemly spectacle, as embarrassing to the Pentagon as it was to the White House, demanded compromise. The result was ""don't ask, don't tell.""

A peculiar blend of hypocrisy, forbearance and accommodation, the ""don't ask, don't tell"" formula has since come to embody the essence of civil-military relations in the Clinton era. To forestall military obstructionism, the administration avoids policies that might threaten important interests of the armed services. Having learned on the job to respect military sensitivities, the president asks of his military leaders only what he knows they are willing to deliver. Assured that their civilian mastersare taking concerns of the services into account, the top brass obligingly reverts to its preferred position as obedient and apolitical servants of the state. Thus are preserved the essential myths of civilian control and military professionalism.

For this, we may be grateful. Yet the bargaining necessary to sustain civil-military amicability in the face of cultural upheaval at home and recurring crises abroad does not necessarily produce sound policy. Indeed, the evidence suggests the contrary. Compromise, logrolling and obeisance to parochial interests may be part and parcel of politics, but in the realm of military affairs they offer a poor substitute for principle. That is true with regard to explosive issues such as gender and sexual orientation, and it is truer still when contemplating the actual use of American power.

Operation Desert Fox, the four-day air campaign against Iraq that is the most recent in this administration's long list of martial endeavors, illustrates that point. Critics have noted that this ersatz war manifested all of the now-familiar characteristics of the so-called ""Clinton doctrine"" on the use of force: the extraordinary importance assigned to avoiding U.S. casualties, thereby advertising America's own point of vulnerability; the hand-wringing preoccupation with collateral damage, signaling that the United States has no stomach for war as such and thereby encouraging adversaries to persevere; the reliance on high-technology weapons employed at long range, inviting confusion between the technical capability to hit targets and the achievement of operationally meaningful results; vaguely formulated objectives often explained in terms of ""sending messages""--allowing for facile claims of ""success"" and the prompt recall of the forces engaged.

The aftermath of Desert Fox also testifies to the flaws of this approach to using force. Saddam Hussein survives and, having survived, has prevailed. Henceforth, his efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction will proceed without interference from outside inspectors. Growing international sympathy for the plight of the Iraqi people will erode economic sanctions against Iraq. What U.S. missiles destroyed, profits from the sale of oil can rebuild. At the cost of yet another billion or so dollars, the United States finds itself shouldering--almost alone and in apparent perpetuity--a security burden that supposedly benefits the entire international community. Members of that community, meanwhile, castigate the United States for being a bully. Although Americans may take comfort from the fact that Desert Fox killed only a relative handful of Iraqi civilians, those deaths served no real political purpose, raising troubling questions about the moral justifiability of the entire enterprise.

Policies that give birth to such results reflect the president's own tenuous grasp of military affairs. A personal ambivalence about the legitimacy of violence in international politics no doubt contributes to it. Clinton's overall approach to employing American military might, at once indiscriminate and timorous, cannot easily be separated from his own youthful experience on the fringes of an antiwar movement uncomfortable with the exercise of American power.

Yet if responsibility for misusing American power rests ultimately with the chief executive, the military itself cannot escape its own share of the blame. Senior officers were present at the creation of the Clinton doctrine. They have shaped it and have given it their stamp of approval. Indeed, the operation that established the parameters of that doctrine, the puny cruise missile attack in June 1993 on an all-but-empty Iraqi intelligence headquarters as retaliation for the attempted assassination ofPresident Bush, was the handiwork of Gen. Colin L. Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

In other words, if operations such as Desert Fox amply display Clinton's own apprehensions, they also testify to phobias endemic to the present American military establishment. Despite the fact that the generation of soldiers who fought in Vietnam has now all but passed from active service, memories of that war have not died. The sense of abandonment and betrayal, anguish at being depicted as moral monsters, and resentment at being scapegoated for a debacle not entirely of their making remain fixed inthe collective psyche of American military professionals.

Operations that adhere to the Clinton doctrine assure the military that it need not fear a recurrence of any such nightmare. There will be no quagmire, no body counts, virtually no risk, no loss of status--just a visually impressive barrage directed at facilities whose occupants have left for the day.

Clinton's senior military advisers know that Desert Fox was an elaborate sham, theater rather than a serious effort to use force for meaningful political objectives. But given the terms of the reigning civil-military compact, they are no more likely to communicate that view to the president than he is to press his generals to develop military options that hold the promise of ending once and for all the threat posed by Saddam. The president won't ask and they won't tell.

Thus, the price of civil-military harmony is a defective policy that wastes resources, alienates allies and undermines American credibility abroad. That, rather than soldiers' low opinion of the president's character, should be cause for concern.

Operating under strict guidelines and conditioned to timidity, the U.S. military will make the same errors it made in Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti and Iraq.


Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers
Any peacekeeping force must first create an environment where peace has a chance. This means taking away the weapons and arresting, or otherwise neutralizing, the men who thrive by killing. America's repeated mistake is to imagine that everyone wants peace. Most people would, of course, prefer lives governed by laws rather than gunshots. But a small, brutal and irredeemable core of men like to kill. Conditioned to safety, the majority of Americans do not understand that there are others whose identity and success is based on violence. And the more privileged the American, the further removed he is from the culture of knife and gun.

Washington imagines that diplomacy can always find grounds for agreement. But killing is addictive. The man who lives by the gun, who profits from violence and has no skills marketable in peacetime, is not interested in supporting treaties that condemn him to poverty and marginality.

It takes less than 1% of a population to destroy a fragile country. The same small proportion, well-armed, can enslave the ruins. That is what happened in the former Yugoslavia, and it is the story of dictators, terrorists and ideologues everywhere. The men with the guns make history. If their guns are not taken away, history remains in their hands.

America must recognize that the warlords, hard-core gunmen, torturers and black-market kings have no stake in peace--unless it is peace on their terms. Such terms leave no room for the rule of law, free speech, free markets or popular sovereignty. Washington's representatives do not deal with like-minded counterparts, but with calculating monsters. The men who ravaged their country cannot be counted on to rebuild it.

America's past failures have not been for lack of opportunity. In Bosnia, the local thugs on all sides were so fearful of America's capabilities at first that the U.S. Army could have rounded up the worst offenders with little resistance. Led by America, NATO could have confiscated far more weapons than it did.

But the Clinton administration wanted action without political cost. Consequently, America's military leadership, politicized as never before in this century, made toothlessness a policy, carrying caution to an extreme that squandered Bosnia's chances. When a replacement American general did find the stomach to arrest a few indicted war criminals, it was too little, too late. The culture of corruption and ethnic apartheid is now so firmly embedded that Bosnia will survive only as long as NATO keeps it in the intensive-care ward.

In Iraq after Operation Desert Storm, America let a monstrous dictator keep his arms and army. In Somalia, Washington fell for the line that arms were part of the local culture. In Haiti, U.S. diplomats imagined that lifelong criminals would reform after a lecture on democracy. Now, in Kosovo, the minimized mission will be to keep the armed factions apart, not to bring the rest of the population together.

Today the gunman rules in much of the world. He will shape tomorrow, as well, unless America recognizes that baby-sitting with bayonets resolves nothing and only postpones the resumption of conflict. If Washington's well-intentioned interventions are to become meaningful contributions to a better world, they must begin by eliminating the worst local offenders. This will have a cost, and sometimes the cost will be in American lives. But military deployments are a sham if they do no more than give the gunman time to lick his wounds or consolidate his criminal empire. They may even do more harm than good. Is Iraq or Somalia, Haiti or even Bosnia better for America's half-hearted efforts?

The gunmen have to go. Their weapons must be removed, not just buried or stacked in local armories. The rule of law is the only basis for peace--especially where hatreds are deep and recently aggravated. Getting intervention right means a higher cost in money, forces and, sometimes, lives.

If America is not willing to do that which is necessary in Kosovo--disarming, arresting and enforcing--Washington's efforts will be no more than another time-out call between bouts of slaughter.",5,Warfighting,,,,,,,68,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846

stop, the man with the gun. Yet, as a military professional much of whose career was tied to NATO missions, I
guarantee that there was a mighty sigh of relief in Brussels the morning after the first few waves of air attacks.
The system worked.
Despite decades of training and planning, questions haunted NATO as to whether so many disparate nations,
with their own nuanced goals, varied military systems, and dramatically different levels of combat readiness,
could operate effectively together on a battlefield. At least in the air, the answer is yes. NATO's air arm has
performed remarkably well, conducting a textbook mission. While the textbook is the wrong one for the bloody,
low-tech butchery in Kosovo, NATO's militaries did what the political leadership ordered, and did it well.
The political alliance is another matter. While initial alarms about Italian doubts or Greek sentiments were
overstated, the commitment of ground troops into combat -- which appears ever more likely -- would trigger
alliance-wide soul searching and flight from responsibility. Focused on its own difficulties in initiating and
sustaining military operations, the U.S. overlooked the much greater difficulties faced by parliamentary
democracies with unstable governments, which is the real lesson of Italy's wish to return to diplomacy as soon as
possible. As for Greece, it has long been NATO's spoiler, and, despite quiet support for the current operation, it
may have no long-term future in NATO. Operation Allied Force is going to separate the workers from the strategic
welfare recipients.
With each passing day's new atrocities, the alliance faces an increasingly stark operational choice: Go in on the
ground, or allow the Serbs to continue with the massacres and ethnic cleansing that NATO's attack has
exacerbated. Because the apostles of air power oversold their capabilities to national leaders anxious to believe
in warfare on the cheap -- at least in lives -- NATO made the strategic blunder of beginning a campaign without
assembling either the will or all the tools that might be necessary to bring it to a conclusion.
War may sometimes be an extension of policy by other means, as Clausewitz described it, but war is not obedient
to policy. Talk of ground troops has been taboo in every NATO capital. Now reality has intruded on wishful
thinking. The alliance's failure to prepare for all options, due to political sensitivities, has left it unprepared for an
endgame. Adequate troops are not in place, and could not be deployed in sufficient force for weeks or longer.
The ground combat issue could cleave the alliance. Will President Clinton find the resolve to finish the task he
and his advisers began with their eyes willfully closed? Will France, the pivotal state, participate? Or will Paris
hold back, planning for a future relationship with Belgrade to counter Bonn's intimacy with Zagreb? Can
doubt-wracked Germany, already nervous over its commitment of aircraft to the mission, take the next step? Or
will it wring its hands and weep and wait? Will NATO's first combat foray collapse, forcing a more difficult reprise
of Desert Storm, with American and British troops bearing the combat burden while others linger in the rear?

Warfare trains a spotlight on a nation's soul. Especially if operations prove protracted and indecisive, American
politicians may seize upon NATO as a negative campaign issue. In Europe, a new north-south divide could
emerge. NATO may become factionalized, with the major northern states, from Britain to Poland, willing to accept
the need for military action beyond the terms of the Atlantic Charter, while southern tier countries, such as Italy,
Greece, Spain and Portugal, draw away, perhaps following the French model from the 1960s of political but not
military membership. Turkey, ignored but essential, may find itself geographically isolated from the new NATO
heartland north of the Alps and across the Atlantic.
The alliance is unlikely to dissolve. The issue is whether NATO will emerge from this crisis invigorated or
hollowed-out. The costs, duration and results of this operation will force a re-examination of NATO's purpose. A
strengthened -- somewhat streamlined -- NATO may evolve as an effective instrument for dealing with the crises
of the coming decades. Or the alliance may become a feckless shell, relying on a minority of ""fighting states"" --
Britain, the U.S., Poland, Turkey and perhaps Germany -- to do its dirty work on their own.
The Kosovo crisis will redraw Balkan borders, although Belgrade, Brussels and Washington continue to claim
otherwise. Yet behind the hype about spreading conflagrations, Kosovo is only a regional and humanitarian
concern. The changes the crisis may bring to the most important alliance in history will matter to the world.

"Odom, William",1988,1,1999-04-02,1,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Take Belgrade,"Thus the president has only one alternative: a ground invasion. It's important to stress that such an attack should be directed at destroying Mr. Milosevic's power, not at the Serbian people. ","O n the first page of the first chapter of the first book of ""On War,"" Carl von Clausewitz wrote in italics: ""War is an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will ."" Has bombing alone ever ""compelled"" any of our enemies? By ignoring this obvious point, the U.S. intervention in Kosovo is fast turning into a disaster. Today we are at war without an effective plan and properly deployed forces, conducting combat operations that accelerate Serb atrocities rather than deter them.

Thus the president has made himself and the American people at least partly culpable for the slaughter in Kosovo. We cannot evade this reality. We can only decide how we deal with it. To argue, as some administration officials do, that we bear no blame because Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic would eventually kill or expel all of these Kosovars in any case, is ludicrous. Even if it is true, it is irrelevant. Today he is killing them because our bombing campaign has given him both the opportunity and the incentive.

If we now fail to bring this war to a successful conclusion, not just liberating Kosovo from Mr. Milosevic's tyranny but also destroying Mr. Milosevic personally along with his regime, then far more blood will be on our hands. Moreover, we will inspire greater doubts about the viability of NATO in the post-Cold War era than if we had not bombed in the first place.

Thus the president has only one alternative: a ground invasion. It's important to stress than such an attack should be directed at destroying Mr. Milosevic's power, not at the Serbian people. (Nor should we take the side of the Albanians, whose own record has hardly been blameless over the years.) There are promising liberal politicians among the Serbs, and a military defeat might give them the impetus to take power. But we should be prepared if necessary to keep a NATO force in place for decades to quash any temptation among local politicians to wait out the occupation.


No one can confidently predict what a ground invasion will require, especially without the most reliable intelligence about Serbian forces. It will certainly require several weeks or longer to prepare. It can be won, however, and won fairly rapidly once NATO forces are deployed in the region.

While our planners will insist on a large advantage in the balance of military power, there is considerable public information suggesting that the Serbian forces are not all that effective. Their conscript soldiers are poorly trained, and their junior officers have no training comparable to that of their NATO counterparts. Serbia deploys more than 300 antiquated T-54/55 tanks and 232 more modern T-72s, but the entire Serb tank force is no match for a single battalion of U.S. M-1A2 tanks. Apache attack helicopters should have a field day against Serbian ground forces. U.S. mechanized infantry mounted in Bradley Fighting Vehicles with 20mm twin guns can destroy most Serbian armor. And, as things now stand, the Serb military in Kosovo is too busy executing young male civilians and pushing their wives and children into Macedonia and Albania to build strong defensive positions against a NATO ground attack.

A ground invasion must not be limited to Kosovo. In fact, the approach from Hungary—now a NATO ally—into the Voivodina region of Serbia and directly to Belgrade is open country that invites a high-speed armored ground attack. The German military swept down this corridor in World War II, taking the whole of Yugoslavia in a couple of weeks. NATO forces today probably have an even greater qualitative edge over the Serbs than the Wehrmacht had then. And supplying our forces on this front should be much easier than in Kosovo, at least at the beginning.

Some official spokesmen have estimated that 200,000 troops will be required for an invasion; others put the figure at 30,000 to 40,000. Only NATO planners with the latest intelligence are in a position to make sound judgments on this issue, but after following the behavior of the Serbian military for several years, I have become convinced that the lower figure is much closer to what is actually needed, especially after a long bombing campaign has degraded Serbian forces.

More than 20,000 NATO troops are already in Macedonia, poised to make the ""permissive"" entry into Kosovo envisioned by the peace agreement Mr. Milosevic rejected. They should now make a ""non-permissive"" entry, supported by 24,000 U.S. troops stationed in Germany. Facing an invasion from Macedonia and Hungary at the same time, Mr. Milosevic will be doomed.

Unfortunately, we cannot destroy him in time to save the Kosovars from slaughter, but we can at least ensure retribution and an end to any further slaughter, especially in neighboring Montenegro.

American lives will inevitably be lost in such an invasion. This is a legacy Mr. Clinton cannot escape and a price that we must now pay. If we don't, Mr. Milosevic will survive and NATO will unravel.",9,Warfighting,,,,,,,68,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846
"Crowe, William",1989,1,1999-05-04,1,0,0,WaPO,Navy,,,M,More US Ambassadors than Generals and Admirals Have Been Killed in Service Than World War II,We should never allow budgetary considerations to achieve greater importance than the lives of the people who serve our country with selfless dedication. ,"The NATO and U.S. military actions in Kosovo and Serbia have brought about a series of attacks on American embassies in Moscow, Copenhagen, Damascus, Skopje and Toronto. This, of course, is not the first time that unhappiness with our foreign policy decisions has brought dissidents to the steps of our embassies with flag burnings, physical attacks and even gunfire. I suspect the coming weeks will see more such incidents.

The focus of these attacks is not the State Department or the diplomats within those buildings, most of whom have no personal involvement with the policy decisions that are being attacked. Rather, the attacks are being made on the United States and its citizens. In the attackers' minds, they are directly humiliating our country and what it stands for.

In 1998 and early 1999, I chaired the State Department commissions investigating the bombings of our embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi last August. The coordinated attacks against those posts resulted in terrible tragedy -- more than 220 killed and almost 5,000 wounded. There were 12 Americans and 31 Foreign Service nationals killed.

Almost 14 years before we presented our findings to the secretary of state, another commission, formed after the 1983 Beirut embassy bombing, looked at embassy security. Adm. Bobby Ray Inman and his group found serious flaws in the way the government handled protection of our diplomatic installations abroad. Fourteen years later, more than 88 percent of our embassies still do not meet the security standards established by the State Department after the Inman Report.

We found that the failure was a collective one. The responsibility was shared by the State Department, three successive administrations, the Office of Management and Budget and Congress. No one seemed to take this serious issue to heart, and the result was that the overwhelming majority of our diplomatic posts abroad do not meet the necessary requirements for protection.

Our commissions called for a serious and immediate correction of this neglect. We called for annual expenditures of $1.4 billion for 10 years to meet the recommended security upgrades and new construction requirements. The administration, in turn, asked for $36 million in embassy security funding for fiscal year 2000, less than the cost of the one U.S. aircraft shot down in the current operation.

What are the requirements and how should we proceed? The most important long-term issue is physical setback of our buildings. Both the embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi were located on busy thoroughfares, vulnerable to large vehicular bombs. New embassies must be located in such a way as to give them effective setback from the public streets. This doesn't mean that we isolate our posts or make them fortress-like. It simply means that we protect them from the most dangerous vulnerability.

The key short-term issue is windows. More than 90 percent of those killed and wounded in Nairobi were victims of flying glass. Even though the embassy windows had a Mylar film coating, every person standing close to a window facing the bomb blast was killed. To our surprise, the State Department asked for $57 million in the emergency supplemental legislation following the August bombings to purchase more Mylar! Our report took strong issue with this decision. We believe that we must move quickly to use the technologically advanced laminated glass process in our embassies. This is something that can and should be done immediately.

As one who served in uniform for 47 years, I know the great responsibility of putting military men and women in harm's way. Every effort is made to enhance their protection. I believe that we should establish the same standard for the men and women of our Foreign Service, who serve as our representatives in 162 countries around the world. I think that we owe them the same protection and security that our military forces receive, especially when we reflect that more ambassadors than generals and admirals have been killed in service since World War II.

It is ironic that, in situations such as Kosovo, we will spend billions of dollars in a bombing campaign designed to aid the ethnic Albanian population there with hardly a nod to the protection of American embassies and their staffs, all of which share increased risks from the crisis. We should never allow budgetary considerations to achieve greater importance than the lives of the people who serve our country with selfless dedication.

Or will President Clinton win the Neville Chamberlain memorial umbrella trophy for accepting a phony peace?

Or will President Clinton win the Neville
Chamberlain memorial umbrella trophy for accepting a phony peace? Let us hope for the former -- although much
evidence suggests the latter will come to pass.
It would have been difficult to achieve peace even if Slobodan Milosevic had fully accepted NATO's demands: stop
the ethnic cleansing, pull all Serb forces out of Kosovo, allow all Kosovo refugees to return home, accept a NATO
military force in Kosovo and accept a politically autonomous Kosovo and an eventual plebiscite for full sovereignty.
But these demands were not fully met. Although the details are yet unclear, it seems that Mr. Milosevic and his
Russian adviser, Viktor Chernomyrdin, have introduced sufficient ambiguity to undermine a stable settlement.
Consider just these points.
First, there will be no future referendum on Kosovo sovereignty, as the original peace plan in Rambouillet, France,
had demanded. Although the current proposal guarantees Kosovo ""substantial autonomy,"" NATO has also agreed
to take into account Yugoslavia's ""sovereignty and territorial integrity.""
Does this mean that NATO must now guarantee permanent Serbian rule over Kosovo? If NATO forces had
occupied Serbia by force of arms, then it would have been possible to create a Serbian regime acceptable to an
autonomous Kosovo. But this is not the case. And now NATO could find itself in the paradoxical position of
defending Mr. Milosevic's formal rule of Kosovo.
Second, the peace plan calls for the demilitarization of the Kosovo Liberation Army. It is unclear whether the K.L.A.
will give up its arms without a fight. If it resists, many Kosovars and Albanian groups would probably support it.
Again the paradox of letting Mr. Milosevic use NATO to disarm his opposition is difficult to exaggerate.
Third, the military command arrangements are vaguely described, but it seems that they require a United Nations
commander with at least some separate national contingents, most important the Russian forces. How NATO
stands within the United Nations command is not clear, but if the NATO commander does not also wear the hat of
Page 2 of 3
A Conditional Surrender
the United Nations commander, the international force in Kosovo could be rendered ineffective. This would allow
Mr. Milosevic to retain de facto local control. Something similar happened to the United Nations force in Bosnia.
Moreover, a confused or disputed military structure will be unable to return all the refugees.
The role of Russian troops is also a troubling factor. During the negotiations, Romanian spokesmen have called
them an unwanted and threatening presence in the Balkans. If Russia were a politically and economically stable
country with considerable military power, Moscow's involvement would be understandable. But it is not. It is a weak,
frustrated and unpredictable country with vengeful and mercurial politicians who wish NATO no success. Although
Boris Yeltsin may use Russian troops responsibly, their presence in Kosovo will give the next Russian president
undue leverage for all kinds of troublemaking. He could use troops to increase Belgrade's influence in Kosovo. He
could threaten to pull them out, in an effort to undermine the legitimacy of the United Nations presence. He could
demand that NATO's official presence be abolished.
No less critical for the multinational military force is a large United States contingent, large enough to insure that
American diplomats are backed with adequate power to enforce occupation policies. Returning the refugees,
creating a new Kosovo government and bureaucracy and disarming the K.L.A. will try the wits of a fully unified
command. If it faces divided political counsel it will flounder.
These three aspects of the apparent deal with Mr. Milosevic should give anyone pause. Far more troubling,
however, are the larger implications for the Balkans, European security and United States leadership in the world.
President Clinton's failure to make the overthrow of Mr. Milosevic a war aim leaves the Serb leader free to destroy
the pro-NATO regime in Montenegro, to repress the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina and to cause trouble
elsewhere, especially in Kosovo. Macedonia remains fragile, and its own Albanian minority is now probably larger. It
could become a majority if a couple of hundred thousand Kosovar refugees remain there. Albanian ambitions in the
region are also not to be discounted. Tensions could rise between Bulgaria and Greece over Macedonia. In other
words, the present peace deal could only be a truce that allows all sides to prepare for the next and larger war.
Consider European security. Because of Mr. Clinton's repeated hesitations and equivocations, and his general
failure since 1993 to get ahead of spreading disorder in the former Yugoslavia, Europe faces great uncertainties at
the very time it should be most self-assured. The war in Kosovo has convinced many Europeans that the United
States is no longer reliable. The American inability to lead the alliance and to use military power effectively is the
talk of Europe.
Now, a purely European military, outside NATO, is being planned. The leaders of 15 European countries decided
last week to make the European Union a military power for the first time in its 42-year history, with a command
headquarters, staff and forces. It will probably lead nowhere, but lack of confidence in Washington won't disappear.
Thus, the lasting legacy for President Clinton and his diplomats could be that under their leadership, the demise of
NATO began, even in its years of maximum relative power.
At the global level, decreasing confidence in American leadership will soon be manifest elsewhere, outside of
Europe. Already the bombing-only strategy, which reflected a fear of a ground war and its attendant casualties, has
undercut America's moral standing. Anti-American dictators are probably recalculating their own limits for
successful actions against United States interests.
The potential legacy of the impending settlement with Slobodan Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes, is
painful to contemplate. It is easy to satirize this episode as Mr. Clinton winning Neville Chamberlain's umbrella, but
it will not be easy to live with the realities if the satire is accurate. Let us hope it is a gross distortion",9,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,68,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846
"Peters, Ralph",1998,1,1999-06-07,1,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Peace in Kosovo: And the Peace May Be Even More So,"A true NATO victory [in the Balkans] would have seen an independent Kosovo, the punishment of war crimnals and a change of regime in Belgrade. ","An iron maxim in fighting dictators, warlords and thugs is that they will try to cut a deal when cornered. Thanks to
NATO's surprising unity, a broadening air campaign, a growing threat of ground troops, a Kosovo Liberation Army
offensive that forced the Serb military to expose itself to air attack and above all to Slobodan Milosevic's personal
fears following his indictment as a war criminal, Mr. Milosevic decided to bargain.
The West fell for it. On the cusp of victory, we returned to Mr. Milosevic with weakened demands, which he
accepted readily. Now we are told that peace is at hand. If it is, it will be a bad peace. Anxious to avoid a ground
campaign, NATO and the Clinton administration compromised on their stated goals, sold out the Kosovar
Albanians, resolved nothing and guaranteed that the Balkans will continue to fester.
A true NATO victory would have seen an independent Kosovo, the punishment of war criminals and a change of
regime in Belgrade. Instead, NATO abandoned the Rambouillet demand for a future referendum to determine the
fate of Kosovo and promised that Kosovo would remain a province of Serbia. Worse, the Europeans and
Americans tacitly agreed that the criminals who ravaged Kosovo will not suffer for their deeds. The slovenly deal
cut with Belgrade is so vague that it will permit the Serbs to make endless trouble after the bombing stops, while
the bombing will be nearly impossible to resume.
The loopholes will also pose tremendous, potentially-deadly challenges for U.S. troops and other peacekeepers:
-- NATO troops will not establish a military government. Who will govern? As refugees flood back into their
devastated homeland, who will provide for the rule of law, or even rudimentary justice? The Serbs? The Kosovar
Albanians, whose legitimacy the peace agreement declines to recognize? The peacekeepers are going to enter a
power vacuum, and the international community has no police force or civil administration prepared. What do
commanders do in the face of anarchy? To whom do they turn when they require a local counterpart? Whose law
applies? Who decides to whom the last house left standing on the street belongs, in a land whose records have
been destroyed?
-- There is no provision for punishing war criminals, from Mr. Milosevic down to the neighbor with the knife. This
has been the enduring problem of the 1990s in the former Yugoslavia. Massacre occurs with impunity, and no
one takes the weapons and power away from the thugs. What if we find that the Serbs did indeed execute
thousands of Kosovar Albanian males? Do we look the other way, allowing the perpetrators immunity so long as
they remain in Serbia? Will there be no penalties at all for the murderers, rapists, ethnic cleansers and the men
with the torches?
-- NATO has agreed that Kosovo will remain part of Serbia. The Kosovar Albanians have fought and suffered for
their freedom. Desperate for any peace we can get, we have chosen to ignore their rights and expectations. Will
U.S. forces find themselves in the position of fighting a low-intensity conflict against ethnic Albanians to protect
the territorial integrity of Serbia? The agreement provides for the ""demilitarization"" of the KLA. Does that mean
disarming it while allowing the Serbs to keep their military intact beyond a shallow buffer zone? Who actually will
take the guns away from the men who have fought against such odds for their independence? Yes, there are
bloody-handed, criminal elements within the KLA, and one U.S. official even branded them terrorists. Yet Israel
was founded by men the British considered terrorists; today we recognize those men as heroes. Will we re-enact
the Palestinian Mandate, forcing the Kosovar Albanian freedom-fighters to fight us next?
-- Fundamental issues remain to be resolved regarding the peacekeeping force. The force is now a vague,
part-NATO, part-United Nations, part-Russian potpourri. How will the command and control work? Will the
Russians be allowed to act as spoilers? Where are the limits of the force's scope of action? Since Kosovo is still

part of Yugoslavia, must the peacekeepers deal only with Belgrade's representatives, turning their backs on the
KLA and other Kosovar Albanians? Do the Serbs get to collect taxes from the refugees? As absurd as such
matters may sound, we may be assured that Mr. Milosevic and his monstrous underlings will make the most of
them -- and make fools of us in the process. Flawed though the Dayton accords were, they achieved a basic
operational clarity. This time, our peacekeepers will be marching into a fog.
Some matters, such as rules of engagement, will be resolved in the next few days. Others will take years to work
out. And we will have the time, because our forces are going to be in Kosovo (as well as in Bosnia) for a
generation. This is Cyprus, not Grenada. Troops levels will decline over the years, but, due to our inability to finish
what we began, the Balkans will continue to drain America's resources and paralyze a significant portion of our
military -- especially our shrunken Army -- for decades.
Champagne corks may soon pop in the White House. The Kosovar refugees -- those still alive -- may return to
their broken land. Mr. Milosevic will continue to rule his medieval kingdom, and the rest of the Serb war criminals
will go home to their families and criminal networks. The U.S. military will stand guard in Kosovo to ensure that
freedom-fighters are denied independence. Defense contractors will insist that we should buy still more
gold-plated fighters, since air power can do it all. And once the refugee clips are off the networks, the American
people will forget the Kosovo debacle. Mr. Clinton is counting on that.",5,Warfighting,,,,,,,68,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846
"McCaffrey, Barry",1995,0,1999-06-29,1,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Don't Legalize Those Drugs,"Drug consumption damages the brain, which in turn produces other forms of destructive behavior. US law does not grant people the right to destroy themselves or others. Addictive drugs were criminalized because they are harmful; they are not harmful because they are criminalized. ","Three-quarters of the U.S. population opposes the legalization of psychoactive drugs such as heroin, cocaine,
LSD, methamphetamine, and marijuana. Therefore, the term ""drug legalization"" has rightfully acquired pejorative
connotations. Many supporters of this position have adopted the label ""harm reduction"" to soften the impact of an
unpopular proposal that, if passed, would encourage greater availability and use of drugs -- especially among
children. The euphemism of ""harm reduction"" implies that legalizing dangerous substances would reduce the
harm these substances cause. In fact, condoning drugs would increase their use and hence their harm.
Drug use imposes an unacceptable risk of harm on the user and others. The evidence supporting this viewpoint is
chilling:
Substance abuse wrecks families. A survey of state child-welfare agencies found substance abuse to be one of
the top two problems exhibited by 81 percent of families reported for child maltreatment. Researchers estimate
that chemical dependence is present in at least half of the families involved in the child welfare system. One study
published in the Journal of the American Medical Association revealed that non-drug users who live in
households where drugs are used are 11 times more likely to be killed than individuals from drug-free
households.
Drug-dependent individuals are responsible for a disproportionate percentage of our nation's violent and
income-generating crimes such as robbery, burglary or theft. National Institute of Justice surveys consistently find
that between one-half and three-quarters of all arrestees have drugs in their system at the time of arrest. In 1997,
a third of state prisoners and about one in five federal prisoners said they had committed the crimes that led to
incarceration while under the influence of drugs.
Injection-drug users place themselves at great risk. A University of Pennsylvania study of Philadelphia
injection-drug users found that four times as many addicts died from overdose, homicide, heart disease, renal
failure and liver disease as did from causes associated with HIV disease. Dr. James Curtis, director of addiction
services at Harlem Hospital Center, explains: ""It is false, misleading and unethical to give addicts the idea that
they can be intravenous drug abusers without suffering serious self-injury.""
Clearly, drugs themselves harm users. A significant percentage of all current drug users are addicted to illegal
substances. Addiction is a brain disease that changes a person's neurochemistry. For 4 million chronically
addicted people, drug use is not a choice and hence has little to do with personal liberty. Removing the threat of
criminal sanctions would eliminate the possibility of forced treatment and condemn countless addicts to miserable
lives.
One argument given for drug legalization by harm-reduction advocates is that the ""war against drugs has been
lost."" Aside from the fact that this is not a war, much progress has been made. Current drug policies are reducing
drug use and its consequences. Drug use in this country has declined by half since 1979. The number of current
users dropped from 25 million in 1979 to 13 million in 1996. The decrease in current use of cocaine has been
even more dramatic.
This is not to say that drug policies cannot be improved. The 1999 National Drug Control Strategy is implementing
important changes. The strategy's number one goal is prevention. In the past four years, the administration
increased spending on prevention by 55 percent while spending on treatment rose 25 percent. The strategy calls
for more treatment in the criminal justice system to break the cycle of drugs and crime.
Page 12 of 12 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
At root, the debate over drug legalization boils down to a question of risk. Studies show that the more a product is
available and legitimized, the greater will be its use. If drugs were legalized, the cost to the individual and society
would grow astronomically. Removing the criminal status associated with drug use and sale would not make such
activity less criminal when drug abuse wrecks young lives. It is criminal that more money is spent on illegal drugs
than on art or higher education; it is criminal that crack babies are born addicted and in pain; it is criminal that
thousands of adolescents lose their health and the freedom to create a bright future.
Harm-reduction advocates tolerate drug use because they consider it part of the human condition that will always
be with us. Many other perennial problems such as racism, theft and aggression cannot be extinguished entirely,
but we still resist their damage and criminalize the practices. No one argues that we should legalize these
activities to make them more sanitary or provide tax revenues.
On a judicial level, the question of drug legalization comes down to whether we should legalize destructive
behavior. With respect to the individual, society at large and the environment, American jurisprudence has run in
the opposite direction. Americans have decided that people do not have a right to ride motorcycles without
wearing helmets, drive cars without using seat belts, pollute the environment at will, or endanger the self and
others by refusing vaccination or similar life-saving health measures. In general, our laws indicate that
self-destructive activity should not be permitted or condoned. Drug consumption damages the brain, which in turn
produces other forms of destructive behavior. U.S. law does not grant people the right to destroy themselves or
others. Addictive drugs were criminalized because they are harmful; they are not harmful because they were
criminalized.

European empires that took half a millennium to rise, gorge themselves and collapse shaped the world we know. Their legacies could not be settled in a few decades.

Rather, the creation of postimperial systems of human organization has barely begun, artificially delayed by the bloc system of the Cold War. Many of the regional powers that arose as empires receded will prove no more than transitional regimes. These include Indonesia, Iraq, Russia as currently constituted, the nations of the southern Balkans, a host of multitribe African states, newly independent states in Eurasia, and those parts of the old Spanish empire that still have not settled after two centuries of independence.

The most durable and pernicious vestiges of the European empires are the organization of disparate peoples into states convenient to the withdrawing powers and the related callousness of boundaries drawn by kings and emperors without regard for human affinities or even geographic logic. From Chiapas to Kashmir, we see the struggle of less-numerous or less-powerful peoples to escape the smothering embrace of dominant tribes, religious groups and nationalities. The trend in global reorganization is secession, followed in some cases by transborder reunions. Human ""ecological systems"" are struggling to find a new equilibrium after centuries of enforced imbalance. Even at its most inchoate, that struggle is galvanizing to those rendered voiceless in the mini-empires that emerged as the European powers withdrew. The reaction is all the stronger for being delayed; and where the energy cannot be channeled constructively, it turns violent.

The U.S., history's greatest exemplar of freedom, has too-often stood for oppression in the 1990s, mistaking the discipline of tyrannies for beneficial restraint. Whether the Bush administration's bewildering desire to keep the Soviet Union in one piece, or President Clinton's impossible promise to Belgrade that Kosovo will remain part of Serbia, the consistency with which Washington has backed the status quo against the tides of history gives ultimate credibility to the voices that so long and so unjustly saw Washington as an oppressor. Today, the No. 1 priority of American foreign policy seems to be keeping atlases intact.

What is to be done? There are two general principles requisite to a rational, effective foreign policy in our time. First, Washington must take a long-term view of global change. This is difficult for such a democracy, with its brief administrations and happenstance cabinets, but the alternative is to keep fighting fires instead of preventing them. The model that emerges for much of the world, from Africa to Asia, may prove closer to that of Latin America than to the Anglophone experience. Unpracticed in democracy, with no social consciousness beyond blood ties, largely poor and uneducated populations must develop new political and economic cultures in a hurtling world. The coalescence of healthy states where empires fell may take centuries, not decades. We will not live to see the end of this transition.

Second, the U.S. must align itself with the forces of popular change, abandoning its reflexive commitment to the forces of reaction. This does not mean that the national security adviser should slap on a beret and join the guerrillas in the jungle, only that the nation must reconsider its support for, or unstudied cooperation with, atrocious regimes, whether in Saudi Arabia (the world's largest private estate), Russia or China. America must lead the difficult struggle to develop mechanisms that allow for a more orderly, less brutal transition to self-determination for peoples now forced to kneel to hate-filled neighbors.

Borders will change. The only question is how they will change -- through ballots or through bullets. The challenges are enormous, and Washington cannot solve them alone. America's role is to see clearly, and to assist where practical. Our own professed ideals are worthy guidelines. Yet our responses and those of the international community will vary according to the specifics of each situation. In East Timor, international military intervention is justified and doable. In Dagestan, however, intervention would complicate and worsen the situation -- sometimes the locals must settle matters themselves.

Whatever we do or fail to do, the maps of the world 50 years hence will be profoundly different. Many nations will disappear or diminish, while some few may expand. New forms of government, from hybrid democracies to service-based regimes, will emerge. The issue is how much blood will be shed in the shaping.

The old empires are dead. Now we must exorcise the ghosts.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,68,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846

","Russia is creating a political mess and possibly a regional war as it continues to bomb Chechnya, the province that
humiliated Moscow's troops only a few years ago. Some 60,000 people have fled elsewhere in the region, creating
a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" in the words of Ruslan Aushev, the leader of neighboring Ingushetia.
The Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, who promised that the campaign would be limited to bombing intended
to destroy the Chechen economy, has waffled, insisting that he never ruled out the possibility of a ground war.
Newspapers in Moscow report that 50,000 Russian troops have gathered in the area, ready to drive the Chechen
forces into the mountains where they can be left to freeze to death this winter.
If the war is expanded, the ostensible reason will be the string of bombings in Moscow, which have been attributed
to Chechen terrorists although conclusive evidence is lacking. A few voices are expressing opposition to an
escalation. Mr. Aushev of Ingushetia drew a parallel with NATO's war against Serbia, reminding Russian leaders of
how they criticized NATO.
The Russians can bomb for a long time, but they cannot sustain a campaign on the scale of the NATO bombing of
Serbia -- they don't have enough bombers. A successful ground offensive would be even more difficult; the Russian
army performed dismally in Chechnya's mountainous terrain in the mid-1990's. An anonymous Defense Ministry
official told a Moscow newspaper that efforts to seal off the Chechen border were ""sheer madness,"" not a good
omen.
It is true that a repetition of the first Chechen war would be less likely if Russian airborne regiments and select
armored units were made to do most of the fighting. Last time, the Russians used new army recruits and poorly
trained troops from the Interior Ministry.
But if the Chechen forces cannot be cornered fairly quickly, and if they carry an insurgency into Russia proper, as
they did briefly last month in neighboring Dagestan, then a stalemate is likely.
Whether the Russians win or not, the ramifications are ominous. Azerbaijan and Georgia are rightly worried about
the war spreading to their territory. The Russians are pressuring President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia, a
target of repeated assassination attempts that many in the region feel were directed from Moscow, to allow a large
Page 2 of 3
Russia's Next Blunder
number of Russian troops into his territory to seal its border with Chechnya. The protection these troops would give
to Mr. Shevardnadze's enemies might well help topple his Government. Russia also wants to return troops to its
old bases in Azerbaijan, which would undermine President Heydar Aliyev.
Some leaders in Moscow, generals as well as nationalist politicians, may see the war as a chance to reassert
Russian control over the entire Caucasus. But the economic implications for Russia are devastating. A war of even
a few months would cost more money than Russia will get in loans from the International Monetary Fund this year.
Perhaps the war will fizzle out. Maybe the generals will run out of energy and resources. If it continues, however, a
prediction Mr. Shevardnadze made in 1993 may prove all the more relevant. Angered that Russia was aiding the
secessionist movement in the Abkhazia region of Georgia, he warned Boris Yeltsin that the strategy would backfire,
fragmenting the Russian Federation. Soon enough, the Russians lost control of Chechnya. This time, they may risk
losing a lot more.",9,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,68,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846

But if efforts to help are to be taken seriously, they must involve a genuine long-term commitment by the great powers, backed by financial resources, to bring these two enemies to a modus-vivendi. ","Governing Pakistan is a near-impossible task. Consider the daunting realities: 25 percent literacy; 70 percent of the
gross domestic product devoted to defense or debt service; one million refugees from the war in Afghanistan still
living in Pakistan; a home-grown terrorist cadre being trained in local religious schools sponsored by neighboring
Muslim countries; Afghan-based drug trafficking; the constant threat that the 40-year, often violent confrontation
with nuclear-armed India could spin out of control, and a stagnant economy with virtually no renewal conceivable for
years.
Pakistan has the superficial trappings of a democratic system -- a parliament, courts and an elected government.
But in fact it is a feudal cabal, now with nuclear weapons, in which a few families struggle with one another to
achieve absolute power and are inevitably, in Lord Acton's phrase, corrupted absolutely. Four times in the past 10
years, elected governments have been brought down by popular outrage over corruption or ineptitude or both. The
military has governed Pakistan for almost half its 50-year history -- by most accounts the more stable and
prosperous half.
The current parlous conditions, combined with political history, call into question whether democracy can function at
this stage of Pakistan's development. Yet there is a basis for hope. Historically, the Indus basin has been
prosperous. And while Pakistan has suffered 40 years of brain drain, many well-educated expatriates would return
and work to build a functioning state if there were a serious prospect for civil stability. Indeed, for a brief period in
1993, the country benefited from the selfless and enlightened leadership of a Pakistani World Bank official, Moeen
Qureshi, who was appointed as an interim Prime Minister to break a constitutional crisis. But if Pakistan is to
emerge from its current state of collapse, we must face several realities.
In the short term, military control is inevitable and in Pakistan's interest. The army can restore order and should do
so by putting in place a temporary edict of martial law with accompanying restrictions on public assembly. But
military rule presents both a blessing and a risk. Pakistan's often violent standoff with India in the disputed region of
Kashmir could escalate beyond control quickly, especially in light of the Pakistani army's wounded pride after its
imprudent foray into Kashmir's Indian-occupied areas and its subsequent humiliating retreat.
Page 2 of 3
The Uses of a Coup
Our own military leaders must already have been in touch with the army commander, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to
urge restraint in dealing with Nawaz Sharif and other ousted leaders as well as with India. The United States should
also call immediately for a meeting with leaders of the European Union, China, Russia and Japan as well as India
and Pakistan to develop a long-term multilateral strategy for establishing stability in South Asia.
That strategy should include the naming of a full-time emissary responsible for resolving the most volatile political
issue, the Kashmir dispute. Such an outside negotiator could serve the dual purposes of finding a fair solution and
providing India and Pakistan with someone to blame for the compromises they would be required to make. The
strategy must also involve committing World Bank and commercial financing for roads, railroads, ports and other
improvements to stimulate growth in both countries. Without a credible promise that life will get better for the
average citizen, it will be difficult to achieve acceptance of a Kashmir settlement.
It will be necessary, too, to arrange arms control talks between India and Pakistan, together with talks to put in
place measures for stable deterrence: hot lines, risk reduction centers and credible verification measures. The
United States must also be prepared to make commitments to both countries concerning how we would respond to
a threat of conflict between them.
The world has a huge stake in restraining the centrifugal forces at play in both India and Pakistan. But if efforts to

Periodic assertions that the Russian economy is ""on the mend"" or that ""progress toward democracy"" may be slow but is continuing, or that ""polarized politics"" is a thing of the past are simply misleading. Mr. Clinton needs to ask his Russia experts some tough questions.","President Clinton's confrontation with Boris Yeltsin last week over Chechnya seemed to signal he was getting tough with Russia. He isn't. In fact, Mr. Clinton's message is the same as always: Russia is making slow progress toward democracy, and the West should be patient.

A quick look at Russia suggests Mr. Clinton is wrong. While the president advocates forbearance, Russia is busy violating the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, building up its army in the North Caucasus region, supplying weapons to sustain the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and putting vicious pressure on Georgia and Azerbaijan to accept Russian troops on their territory.

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is calling for greater military spending, most of which will fund Russia's campaign in Chechnya, a military offensive that has already killed thousands of Russian citizens and forced scores of thousands more to flee. Opposition politicians report that they are being harassed by the secret police. Financial oligarchs use their media empires for slander campaigns to influence the presidential election next year.

And what does the West do? Prepare to offer another International Monetary Fund loan to Moscow. IMF managing director Michel Camdessus has said he will stop funding if he sees that ""an uncontrolled increase in defense spending is overshooting the budget."" But, given that key Russian military industries have been well-funded over the past few years, all IMF loans have directly or indirectly contributed to weapons production. Economic reform, of course, has been dead in the water.

---

Mr. Clinton's policy is not wholly to blame for this mess, but it hasn't helped. His administration's approach can be summed up as a pair of quid pro quos.

The Clinton ""quids"" assume that Russia is still a great power, and that the U.S. has a duty to encourage the IMF, the World Bank, and private-sector investors to provide large capital assistance. The ""quos"" include an expectation that Russia will make progress toward liberal democracy, while also playing a constructive international role. But the quids cannot possibly produce the quos, because they are based on illusions about Russian realities and possibilities.

First, Russia is not a great power, not even a major European power. Like most postcolonial countries, it is a weak state with leaders who allocate property rights for their own monopolistic advantages and cannot establish law and order or provide minimal public services. Meanwhile, regional rulers, financial tycoons, criminal groups and other social and political interests fight over wealth while producing little or nothing.

This ""weak state"" syndrome is not exceptional. Common in the Third World, it is seldom temporary. Western advisers, for their part, are not very good at telling countries how to escape it. By encouraging Russia's illusion that it remains a first-order power, the Clinton administration only encourages it to behave irresponsibly, as it did in the Kosovo conflict this spring.

Nor do Russia's nuclear weapons justify a claim to first-rank status. To wring our hands about them merely encourages further capricious Russian behavior, such as Moscow's demands for more Western funds to maintain its nuclear-weapons facilities.

Second, pouring capital into the governments of weak states not only fails to produce economic growth but keeps them weak by allowing governments to continue their profligacy without having to collect taxes. They are also not forced to create stable property rights, independent courts and responsible practices, all necessary for effective economic performance.

Consider the impact of IMF loans on Russia. They allow the government not only to ignore Parliament in deciding how to spend money, but also to hide from the same public it would otherwise be responsible to for tax revenues.

In turn, this weak tax system undercuts Moscow's control over regional governments. Of the 89 federal units, an estimated 46 have treaties with the federal government that contravene the federal constitution. Many regional governments actually have ""embassies"" in Moscow. And most of the governors rule their regions as patrimonial estates rather than through liberal democratic institutions.

---

Third, elections in Russia, even if they are competitive, will not produce ""liberal"" democracy. Genuine liberal breakthroughs are made not by popular elections, but by elites who agree to guarantee individual rights. Furthermore, liberal guarantees must be backed up by power arrangements; that is, the separation of powers, especially regarding control of the purse strings.

Russia's elites are nowhere near a consensus on rules that would make a constitutional breakthrough possible. Property rights are intentionally kept vague, and Parliament has no real control over spending. Unilateral presidential decrees have the force of law, and they frequently authorize expenditures. In sum, Mr. Yeltsin enjoys a dramatically antiliberal monopoly of power.

Russia simply is not on the path to liberal democracy or to an effective market economy. Periodic assertions that the Russian economy is ""on the mend"" or that ""progress toward democracy"" may be slow but is continuing, or that ""polarized politics"" is a thing of the past are simply misleading.

"Stockdale, James",1979,1,1999-11-26,1,0,0,NYT,Navy,,,M,John McCain in the Crucible,…I think John McCain is solid as a rock. And I consider it blasphemy to smudge the straight-arrow prisoner of war record of a man who was near death when he arrived in Hoa Loa Prison in 1967…,"I am not surprised by reports that Senator John McCain's political enemies have been
spreading rumors that his famous temper is a sign of a broader ''instability'' caused by his imprisonment in
Vietnam.
In fact, a few weeks ago I received a call from an old friend who is also close to the George W. Bush campaign
soliciting comments on Mr. McCain's ''weaknesses.'' As I told that caller, I think John McCain is solid as a rock.
And I consider it blasphemy to smudge the straight-arrow prisoner-of-war record of a man who was near death
when he arrived at Hoa Loa prison 1967: both arms broken, left leg broken, left shoulder broken by a civilian with
a rifle butt.
He was eventually taken to the same rat-infested hospital room I had occupied two years earlier, and, like me, he
had surgery on his leg. By then the Vietnamese had discovered that his father was the ranking admiral in the
Pacific Fleet, and he received an offer that, as far as I know, was made to no other American prisoner: immediate
release, no strings attached. He refused, thereby sentencing himself to four more years in a cell.
There was a special cramped and hot privy-like structure in that Hanoi prison reserved for whichever American
was causing the Vietnamese the most trouble. I was the first in the camp to be locked up in it, and I gave it the
name Calcutta. There was only room for one person at a time in the cage, and after a couple of months I was
taken out and marched back to a regular cell. As I limped along, I sneaked a peek at my replacement: John
McCain, hobbling along on his own bad leg.
As one of the few Americans who spent more than four years in solitary confinement during that war, I know that
pride and self-respect lead to aggressiveness, and aggressiveness leads to a deep sense of joy when one is
under pressure. This is hardly a character flaw.
The military psychiatrists who periodically examine former prisoners of war have found that the more resistant a
man was to harsh treatment, the more emotionally stable he is likely to become later in life.
The troublemakers who endured long stretches in solitary, the men we called the tigers, are for the most part
more in tune with themselves now than are those who chose the easier path of nonconfrontation, which made
them ''deserving'' of cell mates. The psychiatrists tell us that many of those prisoners who chose a more docile
existence missed out on the joy of ''getting even'' after release; some look back on their performances with regret.
The psychiatrists have it partly right, but the truth of imprisonment is best learned from the writings of men who
have spent a lot of time in cells, like Dostoyevsky, Cervantes and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. The last described his
feeling of high-mindedness in his gulag writings:
''And it was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good.
Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between
classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human
hearts. . . . And that is why I turn back to the years of my imprisonment and say, sometimes to the astonishment
of those about me: 'Bless you, prison!' ''
I understand that, and so does John McCain.

Zumwalt Changed My Life,"Like many wonderful but human institutions, the Navy would never have altered course toward racial equality nor manned the fleet with the best-qualified male and female citien-sailors under its own momentum…Cheers and thanks, Admiral","Tomorrow Adm. Elmo Zumwalt will be laid to rest at the Naval Academy. In late 1972, as the Chief of Naval
Operations, this remarkable man changed my life and untold others forever. More important, he changed the
Navy, and hence the nation, for the better.
As part of a concerted effort to adjust to the end of conscription and to major societal changes, Adm. Zumwalt
decided to open Navy pilot training to women. My mother, a World War II Navy nurse, sent me a newspaper
article announcing the Navy was looking for qualified female candidates. As a 19-year-old undergraduate and
pilot, I could hardly believe my eyes. I decided I was not going to miss this historic opportunity.
With the help of many people, I managed to graduate from college early, and in January 1973 was one of the first
eight women selected to enter naval flight training. I had no intention of staying in uniform past my obligated time.
I ended up retiring after 24 years of exciting, challenging and gratifying service.
It is hard to remember, let alone imagine, for someone who didn't experience it, how anti-military this country was
coming out of the Vietnam War. Growing up in the ultimate Navy town of San Diego, I had high school memories
that included the sight of a blimp flying over the city with a message demanding that the aircraft carrier USS Kitty
Hawk ""Stay Home."" There were reports of race riots aboard Navy ships, high desertion rates, criminal conduct
and generally low morale. Retention bottomed out at 9 percent. Even on Purdue University's conservative
campus, my joining the Navy equated to becoming a ""baby killer"" in the eyes of some classmates.
After reporting for officer candidate school, I began to realize how controversial Adm. Zumwalt was. Like most of
my peers drawn from civilian schools, I knew nothing about Navy life, let alone service politics. The whole
institution seemed stuck in a time and cultural warp.
Yet it was clear this CNO faced both an age and seniority gap: He was seemingly despised by the most senior
officers and respected by the most junior ones; hated by chief petty officers who were known for handling
disciplinary problems with their fists, but loved by newly empowered sailors.
His unambiguous leadership in improving the Navy's lousy race relations was a source of discontent among the
good old white boys. The ""Z-grams""--directives sent to the entire Navy from the CNO himself rather than through
the admirals--that made my presence in flight training possible were the subject of open derision and were
actively opposed by some serving officers. Their behavior was unprofessional, shameful amd contrary to Navy
tradition.
Adm. Zumwalt retired in June 1974, shortly after I earned my gold wings. While in flight training, I had no time for
anything other than learning the ways of naval aviation, so I missed most of what he was doing during the year
our service overlapped. A true professional, in retirement he refrained from ""laying a hand on the rudder from the
grave""; he shared his opinions with serving naval leadership only behind closed doors, not in the press.
It wasn't until I became a middle- grade officer that I fully appreciated just what he had achieved and at what
tremendous personal cost. While I personally benefited from his decision to use more women, Adm. Zumwalt's
most significant accomplishments lay in forcing the naval aristocracy to control rampant racial discrimination while
preparing the Navy to ""fight"" the Cold War under harsh post-Vietnam fiscal constraints and the realities of an
all-volunteer force.

Years ago I found a cartoontitled ""Old Guard Bar and Grill."" Sitting at the bar were two admirals crying in their
beer above the caption, ""If God had wanted women at the Naval Academy, he would have made them men!"" Like
Adm. Zumwalt, other naval reformers have faced similar intellectually shallow opposition in their attempts to
improve the lot of sailors, revolutionize shipboard gunnery, adopt the aircraft carrier and herald the nuclear fleet.
Like many wonderful but human institutions, the Navy would never have altered course toward racial equality nor
manned the fleet with the best-qualified male and female citizen-sailors under its own momentum. Adm.
Zumwalt's methods, however unpopular, were the only way to cast off old lines and allow the Navy to steam into
the future. In my mind's eye, I see the always dignified admiral elbowing up to a heavenly Old Guard Bar and
taking his seat as one of history's truly great Americans and naval leaders. Cheers and thanks, Admiral.

He further stated that he would impose a ""litmus test"" on anyone he nominated to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appointing only those candidates who supported his policy.

As a former member of the Joint Chiefs and the father of a son now serving his nation in the military, I am extremely concerned at the prospect of a president who would use a social or political issue as a measure of an officer's fitness to serve at the highest levels. While Mr. Gore is now rapidly backpedaling, I believe we already have the true measure of his attitude.

By statute, the members of the Joint Chiefs are military advisers to the president, the National Security Council, and the secretary of defense. Decisions on U.S. military participation in conflicts around the world and the extent of that participation are based, in part, on the counsel of these military advisers. During the first four major conflicts of the past century, more than 35 million Americans served their country in the military. Of those who answered the nation's call, more than one million were wounded and hundreds of thousands lost their lives. These men and women were sent into battle by civilian leaders who based their decision on the advice of our most senior military officers. The courage of those who went to battle was rooted in their faith in their country and in those who had determined the need for them to fight.

The most serious debates that take place among the Joint Chiefs are those that determine whether or not we commit our service members to war. The people of this nation -- the mothers and fathers of those who will fight our future battles -- deserve to know that the military individuals selected to provide advice to the civilian leadership on this gravest of matters are the most qualified to do so.

They have the right to expect that the senior uniformed leadership is free to offer its best military advice, even when that counsel is at odds with the commander-in-chief's views. The men and women who wear the uniform and serve selflessly in the military deserve a head of state who has the moral courage to accept, even to demand, the best military advice the Joint Chiefs can provide -- regardless of how that advice might play politically.

There can be no question in the minds of the American people and those serving in the military that an officer's nomination and confirmation to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff must be based on military experience, military expertise and leadership ability. It cannot be based on support or lack thereof for a current social or political position. As a nation we must never allow our elected leaders to subordinate an issue of national security for the sake of political gain.

Now that uphill battle is becoming a losing battle as the force struggles to recruit enough people -- and comes up short. And the problem is only getting worse. ","For nearly 30 years, since the United States began relying on volunteers to fill the ranks of the armed forces, the
military recruiter's job has been a tough one. Now that uphill battle is becoming a losing battle as the force
struggles to recruit enough people--and comes up short. And the problem is only getting worse.
Ironically, demand is down: The force is 40 percent smaller than it was at the end of the Cold War. But supply has
shrunk even more. When the volunteer force was born in January 1973, the military had a fighting chance to be
competitive in the battle for new recruits. For a variety of reasons, economic and social, that is no longer true. And
unless the picture improves, our armed forces will find themselves without enough sergeants and junior officers to
lead their increasingly undermanned and ""mis-manned"" units--and ultimately unable to meet their missions.
The first step toward a solution is realizing that a serious problem exists. In discussions with defense experts and
public policy analysts, and even with senior-level people in the Pentagon, I routinely hear that the U.S. military
has always attracted sufficient manpower and that there's no reason why a continuation of the past approach will
not succeed in the future. Even within the military, there remains what Navy Secretary Richard Danzig has
labeled a ""psychology of conscription,"" one that viewsmanpower as a ""free good.""
I was a second lieutenant at Fort Sill, Okla., when conscription ended, and all of us in the armed forces held our
breath. For the better part of three decades, the ranks had been filled by the draft. Selecting who would serve was
always a difficult and contentious challenge for draft boards and became much more so in the late 1960s, as the
Vietnam War became unpopular and controversial. Determining the number of soldiers needed, however, was
simple: Take the number required to fill the ranks, subtract those who volunteered and draft the difference.
Because of conscription, labor was relatively cheap and abundant.
The all-volunteer force adopted by President Richard Nixon changed everything. Suddenly, the military had to
compete in the labor market as if it were a business. The initial efforts were not encouraging. Despite substantial
pay raises--my own base pay rose four times in a year, from $480 to $620 a month--the armed forces quickly
found that they were undermanned. Compounding this problem, those joining were of a lower quality than
desired. By the late '70s, nearly half of all recruits were in the lowest mental category acceptable for enlistment.
This was the major reason that Gen. Edward ""Shy"" Meyer, the Army chief of staff at the time, famously described
the force as ""the hollow Army.""
Fortunately, help was on the way. The Army, the most labor-intensive service and the one where the all-volunteer
concept had to succeed if it were to succeed at all, sent Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman to take over its recruiting
command. Thurman, who went on to serve as vice chief of staff, was a brilliant soldier with a legendary ability for
data and detail. He quickly concluded that attracting more high school graduates was the key to a quality force,
and they became the focus of his marketing strategy. He tracked down their addresses, determined what
television shows they watched, studied what appealed to their self-image and aspirations, and he sold the Army
to them. Thurman chose the memorable slogan ""Be All That You Can Be,"" and seared it into the consciousness
of a generation. He pushed the Army college fund as a major attraction. He taught the Pentagon how to recruit,
and by dint of personality and intellect he made the all-volunteer concept work throughout the 1980s.
In the mid-'90s, Thurman would occasionally drop by the Pentagon office where I directed the Army chief of staff's
Manpower and Force Structure office. He was deeply concerned by this time that all of the leading indicators for
recruiting were pointing downward. With recruiting stations closing and consolidating, he worried that young
people believed the military was no longer hiring. Few of their parents had served, and high school counselors

were not encouraging students to join. He sensed a massive, daily, yet subtle anti-recruiting campaign underway
across the country and feared that few either recognized it or understood its implications.
Thurman was right, but even he could not foresee the extent of the problem. When he died in December 1995,
America had yet to see sustained, record low levels of unemployment among service-age youth; or the wide
expansion in sources for college assistance; or the shrinking of the supply of high-quality recruits. While the first
two factors are undeniably good for the nation, together they create a serious, growing public policy problem in
recruiting enough labor to fill the ranks of the military.
The nexus of the problem is simple. To borrow a phrase from the 1992 presidential campaign, ""It's the economy,
stupid."" As Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has been emphasizing for months, the labor market is
extraordinarily tight. The record low unemployment rate and growing labor demand are reinforced anecdotally as
workers in certain traditional blue-collar fields are lured to assembly lines with stock options. Given such
conditions, it should be no surprise that units are increasingly undermanned. All the services have lowered their
recruiting goals, and all but the Marine Corps have failed to meet those new goals.
When the all-volunteer force began, unemployment among 16- to 19-year-olds was 13.7 percent. The lingering
effects of the Vietnam War, the 1973 oil crisis, and other economic factors pushed it to 20 percent two years later,
and it remained near that level for 20 years. It was not until April 1998 that the unemployment rate for this key
demographic dropped below its January 1973 level. Thurman never had to recruit in such a tight market, one
where economic opportunities for young Americans were plentiful and attractive.
But the low unemployment rates do not tell the whole story. The recruiting challenge is made more daunting
because of the need for high-quality manpower. The pool of potential enlistees is surprisingly small and seems to
be shrinking. Nationwide, there are about 14 million high school graduates between the ages of 17 and 21, prime
recruiting ages. More than 70 percent of those graduates now attend college, which reduces the pool to less than
4.2 million. But the military considers only those who are physically and medically fit, have no disqualifying police
record and score in the top half of the armed forces standardized aptitude test, which further reduces the pool to
about 800,000.
Two years ago, the college attendance rate was 67 percent and was expected to rise to 70 percent over 10 years.
But a recent study by the Education Trust, a nonprofit organization focusing on minority and lower-income
students, shows that it has already risen to 72 percent. The military's select pool will shrink further if projections
that college attendance will rise to 80 percent by 2005 are correct.
The armed services' demand for labor is large relative to this pool. Last year, the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps had a combined recruiting goal for both active and reserve components of nearly 280,000. In other
words, to meet their objectives, the services had to attract one in three of the 800,000 young people in the select
pool. The services, particularly the two with the most labor-intensive missions--the Army and Marine Corps--met
their recruiting objectives throughout the military's downsizing of the '90s by lowering demand. Fewer people were
brought in as the forces contracted to manpower levels that were down 36 percent from 1991 levels (the number
of combat units is down even more--the Army went from 18 divisions to 10, for example).
But once the downsizing was complete in the mid-'90s, the pipeline had to be turned back on again, and the
demand for recruits sharply increased. Within two years, the Army's need for recruits expanded from about
70,000 to nearly 85,000 annually. Why? Because the services are entry-level-only organizations. To grow the
required number of sergeants and petty officers requires a large entry pool. Unlike a private firm that can go
outside itself and hire new management and line supervisors, the servicescannot. Under-recruiting was workable
at a time when the forces were shrinking, but it was not a feasible long-term strategy for creating leaders.
Beyond the growing imbalance between supply and demand, recruiters lost one of their major selling points. The
promise of higher-education assistance through the Army College Fund used to help bring high school graduates
to the recruiting station. Today, however, there are a growing number of college assistance programs that lessen
the appeal of this benefit, despite the fact that its value--as much as $50,000 per enlistee--has risen considerably.
All but three states now offer some sort of college assistance program including scholarships and pre-paid tuition,
and the federal government provides a range of programs from Pell Grants to the more recent Education IRAs
and tax credits aimed at assisting lower-income students. As more potential recruits take advantage of these
programs, they have less incentive to seriously consider enlisting.
Finally, continuing subtle changes in both society and the nature of the military's mission also have taken a toll on
recruitment. As the second generation of young men and women who have never known anything other than an
all-volunteer force comes of age, the presence in the American household of a parent with military experience
continues to decline. In a recent survey, 21 percent of non-veteran parents said they would be ""disappointed"" if
Page 8 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
their children entered the military. Given that military missions have become increasingly diverse and often distant
from the immediate interests and concerns of the American people, and military pay and other compensation has
declined relative to the economy as a whole, this is not a surprising view.
If the armed forces are unable to fill their ranks, discussions about aging equipment and anemic funding for
modernization, which dominate the current defense debate, will become relatively inconsequential.
The services have several options. One is to increase the supply of potential recruits. This would require a
substantial increase in pay and benefits, very likely well beyond the generous 4.8 percent across-the-board
increase just passed--the largest in almost 20 years. It would also necessitate a more concerted effort to recruit
college students, and certainly college dropouts, and perhaps even high school dropouts who score well on the
standardized test--a current focus of Army Secretary Louis Caldera.
Such steps must be balanced with the increased costs (already up 30 percent per recruit in the past three years)
that would be required to expand the recruiting force. And they must be balanced with the understanding that the
result may be a lowering of the standards that the services feel they need to maintain in an era of increasingly
sophisticated weaponry.
Another solution is cutting the size of the force even more. Under this approach, the services would have to
become considerably more serious about replacing manpower with technology. But the facts suggest that
high-quality military manpower is increasingly scarce, and what is available may become prohibitively expensive.
The sooner this circumstance is recognized, the better for the military and for the nation.

"Odom, William",1988,1,2000-01-28,1,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Why the Chechens Are Winning,"Given Mr. Putin's efforts to diffuse Western outrage -- persuading the Council of Europe not to expel Russia and sending his spin master, Valentin Yumashev, to the U.S. -- the West has more influence on, and more complicity in, the outcome of this war than it wants to believe. Now is the time to act.","One might have thought Russia's first defeat in Chechnya had taught it some lessons. Yet Chechen forces are today bleeding Russian forces, just as they did in January 1995, in the same place and in the same way. Once again the Russians indiscriminately bomb, while the Chechens greet them with accurate small-arms fire, efficiently piling up the Russian dead.

This disastrous performance can understandably cause onlookers to wonder whether the Russian military hasn't always been in such disarray, even in Soviet times. Decay had set in by the late 1970s, greatly accelerated during perestroika and continues today. As the Russian military bogs down in Chechnya, and in the context of Russian electoral politics and economic-reform dilemmas, the West has a greater ability to influence the outcome than its leaders appear to understand.

Last fall the Russian generals appeared to have drawn the proper lessons from 1995. By proceeding slowly, amassing forces and consolidating the open countryside as they took it, they managed to avoid urban combat and keep casualties low as they encircled Grozny and surrounding towns. They also caught Chechen forces less prepared than previously; rebel commanders were quarreling, and the Chechen people did not uniformly support them.

That all changed, however, when the Russian military plunged into Grozny, inserting itself into the same urban combat that was its undoing in 1995. Russian forces recently admitted to 1,173 killed since August, but the Russian Soldiers' Mothers Committee reports 3,000 dead and 6,000 wounded. Acting President Vladimir Putin, the architect and profiteer of this war, has toned down his optimism about an early victory, though with an upcoming presidential election he is desperate for the army to seal a victory. Meanwhile, he has started to spin the bad news from Grozny in ways to lower public expectations.

The beginning of the country's military woes reaches back to the end of Soviet times, and continues today. Several factors have combined to turn what was once a strong military power into a surprisingly weak one.

First, Soviet military forces deteriorated more during perestroika than is generally recognized. Top generals contributed by resisting ""systemic"" reforms urged on them at the time, hoping some enemy of Mikhail Gorbachev would emerge to save them. The Russian generals continue this behavior today. They are eager to fight the Chechens not because their forces are ready, but because they see Mr. Putin as their long-awaited savior.

Second, in the ground forces, which are crucial in Chechnya, the deterioration is worse than in other branches. They are woefully short of troops and without money for training. Commanders often rent their soldiers as serf labor to civilian enterprises, pocketing the income. Junior officers are caught between repressive and corrupt commanders above and few and poor troops below. Pay is erratic, food inadequate and weapons poorly maintained.

Third, to understand what this has done to morale, consider the words of the Chechen foreign minister, Ilyas Akhmadov, speaking recently in Washington, D.C. Asked about a report that Russian forces sell weapons to Chechens, he answered quietly that Chechen forces can buy supplies from Russian units anywhere, even from those on the front during lulls in the fighting.

Fourth, small-unit cohesion is rare. Combat formations in Chechnya have been filled by soldiers drawn from units throughout the country -- a dozen from here, a score from there. No time is available to weld them into combat teams. This is a huge impairment when fighting the type of urban combat that takes place in Grozny, which requires specialized training and minutely coordinated operations. The lightly armed Chechen troops have the enormous advantage of the defender over the attacker in cities.

In short, the situation is delicate, and now may be the time for the West to exert greater pressure to end the conflict. The sooner it does, the better for Russians, Chechens and countries supplying Russia with aid. Russia has already doled out five billion rubles (about $175 million) on the effort, far more than the original expectation of three billion. As these costs continue to mount, they carry disturbing implications for the overall state budget and the future of Russian reforms.

Given Mr. Putin's efforts to diffuse Western outrage -- persuading the Council of Europe not to expel Russia and sending his spin master, Valentin Yumashev, to the U.S. -- the West has more influence on, and more complicity in, the outcome of this war than it wants to believe. Now is the time to act.",9,Warfighting,,,,,,,64,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846
"Scott, James",1996,1,2000-01-30,1,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,"Sticking Point; In Defending Its Troops Against Anthrax, The Pentagon Has Injected Distrust Instead",I do not agree with those who say that refusal to take the vaccine should result in a court martial. Nor do I agree with those who suggest that a commander who cannot get his subordinates to take the anthrax shots will not be able to get them to fight. This is a false test.  ,"I've always believed that the military tries to do the right thing. That's why I never really questioned its decisions to protect me against various diseases--even if I sometimes wondered what the odds of contracting those illnesses might be. Thirty-five years ago, as I prepared for duty in Vietnam, I accepted the painful gamma globulin shots to reduce the risk of hepatitis, even though at the time my fellow soldiers and I had serious questions about their efficacy. I accepted them just as I accepted the forced separation from my family and the rigors of combat. I certainly never considered inoculations to be the most dangerous part of the contract between soldier and state.

So you might think I'd have no understanding for the 300 or so men and women who have refused to take the anthrax vaccine that the Department of Defense has ordered for all 2.4 million active-duty and reservist personnel. But after reading and hearing the confusing and contradictory claims about the vaccination program, and observing the positions of both the Defense Department and the resisters harden into intractability, I've come to believe there's an important message that both sides need to hear:

When you see you are digging yourselves into a hole, put down the shovel.


The anthrax vaccine resisters and the Department of Defense have dug themselves into entrenched positions that are undermining military morale and discipline. This comes at a time when the U.S. military's worldwide commitments are straining the services and putting unprecedented stress on military families, and when recruiting and retention are real challenges.

The Defense Department has failed to establish a credible argument for administering the anthrax vaccine universally. The case has not been convincingly made that the protection offered by the vaccine--delivered in six shots over the course of 18 months--outweighs its potential health risk to individuals. I'm not suggesting the vaccine is risky, only that the Pentagon has failed to demonstrate that the vaccine is safe enough to justify such widespread use in peacetime. At the same time, the take-no-prisoners tactics of the anti-vaccination side have created chaos in some Air Force Reserve and National Guard units, where commanders are being pitted against subordinates over what has become a bitter and divisive litmus test for loyalty. In some units, morale and discipline are fractured, friendships have ended, and civilian and military careers are in jeopardy. The controversy recently came into sharp focus over the potential court-martial of Maj. Sonnie Bates, a pilot and 13-year veteran who had testified on the issue before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee last October and was later served with court-martial papers for refusing to take the vaccine. The only winners in this dispute are the few who wish the military ill in all circumstances.

It's not hard to see the roots of the current dispute. They lie in the Defense Department's long-term loss of medical credibility with the population it serves. That's not the way it used to be. My own experiences with military medicine were positive. In Vietnam, I was twice treated for combat wounds in military field hospitals. In 1983, I was operated on and treated after a serious military parachuting accident. Both of my children were born in military hospitals. And my wife had major surgery at Fort Bragg, N.C. When my younger child entered college, she responded to the question about a family doctor by writing ""Warrant Officer Donovan"" (the rank and name of the Ranger battalion physician's assistant who treated her during my two tours of duty in Savannah, Ga.). I think we were typical of military families of our generation in the way we trusted military medical care.


That level of trust began to deteriorate with the Defense Department's failure to come to grips with reports of the toxic effects of Agent Orange, the defoliant employed to destroy the jungles in Vietnam. The department was slow to respond to initial reports of illness from soldiers who had handled the defoliant during the war, and to the stories of cancers that appeared later. That failure was compounded in the 1990s by the department's perceived reluctance to resolve the complex questions raised by Gulf War syndrome--and by its apparent inability to refute the assertion that at least some of the reported medical problems were caused by hastily conceived combinations of medicines administered to soldiers to protect them from the potential effects of Saddam Hussein's biological and chemical weapons.

Add to that the Internet, and its ability to bring together geographically separated but like-minded individuals and groups, sometimes to share valuable information, sometimes in a frenzy of speculation. Tales of the anthrax vaccine causing paralysis and other dramatic symptoms abound on the Internet. The lack of hard data provided by the Defense Department has served to abet the proliferation of junk science and rumor. It has developed its own Web site (www.anthrax.osd.mil), but if the anthrax vaccination issue is a test of the military's ability to combat innuendo and falsehood in the information age, then the Defense Department has lost this particular battle.

There have been other changes that have served to undermine military personnel's confidence in the department. Many military families feel vulnerable as they watch the overstretched military medical system crumble from chronic underfunding. Free medical care has long been seen--and advertised--as a substantial benefit for soldiers and families. It is an integral part of their compensation, and it has always been something military families felt they could rely on when their loved ones were on duty far away. But many active-duty personnel today doubt that adequate military medical care will be there for them and their families in the future. This is a very real concern for those who are putting their lives on the line for their country--and it brings to mind the words of my first platoon sergeant, explaining a soldier's apparent low morale to me: ""If Momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.""


Then there are the special concerns of reservists. Access to medical care for them is more limited, and subject to their duty status at the time they are injured or fall ill. So reservists, who have civilian as well as military careers to protect, view the risks inherent in any medical intervention differently. It is no surprise that it was mostly reservists who initially raised concerns about Gulf War-related illness, just as it is mostly reservists who first raised concerns about the possible health risks associated with anthrax vaccination.

As we all know, there is an element of risk in any vaccination. There are rare but very serious reactions to vaccinations for diseases such as measles and whooping cough. But most of us believe, most of the time, that the value of vaccination outweighs the risk of the disease. In the 1950s, when I grew up, the fear of polio among my parents and their friends was palpable: They saw the devastating effects of the disease, and wanted to do all they could protect their children from it.

Not so anthrax, which, despite the horror stories, remains a largely abstract horror to many members of the military. They remain unconvinced that they will ever be in danger of exposure to the bacteria. Also the tremendous disparity in reports of adverse reactions to the vaccine is confusing. The Pentagon reports no patterns of long-term or delayed side effects, and fewer than 100 reactions that took people out of work for a day or more among the 383,000 men and women who have already been inoculated in the first of three planned phases. The anti-vaccination side reports much larger, but unverified, numbers.


Looking back, though, it's not difficult to see how positions became so hardened. The threat of biological agents in general, and anthrax specifically, has never been credibly defined as a risk. Explanations to reservists about why they should all be included in the program were inadequate. What's more, there has always been some question about the effectiveness of the current vaccine against anthrax's airborne spores. The vaccine originally was developed to protect veterinarians and other agricultural and meat-packing workers against the disease, not military personnel. Will it work against other, more potent, forms of the bacteria? There is enough conflicting evidence to create legitimate doubt in the minds of some who serve in the armed forces. Dueling ""scientists"" have commandeered the debate, leaving the rest of us wondering who, if anyone, is right. Facts have been left behind; rumors and anecdotes proliferate.

What's to be done? Starting now, the Defense Department must rebuild the credibility of military medical policy and military medicine. If military personnel are to comply quickly and willingly with policies and decisions, they must be confident that their individual interests have been taken into account. They must also believe that the department will take good care of them if anything goes wrong. Adequate funding for the military medical system is a good place to start. A comprehensive plan for taking care of those men and women with genuine ailments connected to service in the gulf is long overdue.

So, here's my message to the Department of Defense: Put down the shovel. Admit that while your intentions were good, implementation was flawed. Continue a measured vaccine program focused on those service members--both active duty and reservists--who are most likely to deploy on short notice to high-risk areas. This is necessary because the vaccination, which takes so long to complete, cannot be delayed until deployment is imminent. Commission a study on anthrax prophylaxis that can stand up to scientific peer review. Ask an outside agency to study the number and severity of reactions to the vaccine and compare the results with other vaccinations. Then you will be prepared to meet the inevitable next challenge with credibility.

And here's what I have to say to the resisters: Put down the shovel and go back to making your units the best they can be. Martyrdom is an option, but the cost to others is high. Ask yourself if your resistance to the vaccine program is based on solid information and a respectful difference of opinion, or if you and the military have lost confidence in each other. If confidence is gone, you face some tough decisions, and may be better off resigning.

I do not agree with those who say that refusal to take the vaccine should result in a court-martial. Nor do I agree with those who suggest that a commander who cannot get his subordinates to take the anthrax shots will not be able to get them to fight. This is a false test. Certainly the principal ingredients for success in warfare are, and always will be, discipline and training. But confidence in the cause, the nation, the chain of command, the members of the unit, the weapons and the system are also important. That confidence is gained from rational explanations based on credible evidence. The men and women who serve in our armed forces deserve no less.

further testing to be completed, it may be useful to recall the history that has brought us to this point.
When President Reagan came to office almost 20 years ago, the Soviet Union had a huge advantage -- 3 to 1 -- in
highly accurate ballistic missiles that had developed over the previous 10 years. Our ability to deter a first-strike
attack with an adequate force of survivable counterstrike weapons -- the concept of mutual assured destruction --
had become tenuous in the minds of sensible American leaders, both Republican and Democrat.
Mr. Reagan had considered but was unimpressed by the theory of mutual assured destruction. He believed strongly
that keeping the peace through a threat to annihilate humankind was immoral, and he came to office with the hope
of starting work on a defensive system. His vision was morally inspired and deeply felt.
Despite his passion for a defensive system, however, nothing was done for two years. It was reported that neither
the uniformed military nor Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger initially believed Mr. Reagan's goals to be
achievable.
In 1981 and 1982, we had tried and failed to maintain the viability of offense-based deterrence. Congress had
rejected deployment of the MX missile, and it became clear that we had to find a new way to deal with a growing
Soviet superiority in first-strike systems. If we couldn't do it offensively, with the MX, then our only alternative was to
explore relying on defense.
That led me, as deputy national security adviser, to ask several leading scientists whether technology had
advanced far enough to warrant another look at a defensive system. The answers from men I respected, like Dr.
John Foster at TRW, were encouraging. I then took the idea to Adm. James Watkins, the chief of naval operations,
since any such concept would need the support of the military to pass muster with Congress.
Admiral Watkins, a cerebral and devoutly religious man, identified with President Reagan's moral motive and was
very supportive. The other chiefs of staff fell into line, seeing the president's strong devotion to the concept and the
scale of potential funding involved.
Page 2 of 3
Missile Defense, Then and Now
In the ensuing years, neither the president nor the team of scientists who focused on strategic defense nor I
believed it would be achievable during his term. But all of us came to believe that we needed to begin exploring
defense to deal with the current, as well as foreseeable, threats.
I also believed that by investing in America's comparative advantage in high technology, we would be competing
more sensibly than we had for the previous 40 years. Conceivably, the burden that competing with the Strategic
Defense Initiative would impose on the Soviet economy -- when combined with the expense of modernizing the
country's conventional forces -- might lead the Soviets to reduce their offensive systems, ultimately eliminating the
need to deploy large-scale, space-based S.D.I.
It was in that context, in December 1984, that I stated in a background session with journalists that because we
wouldn't be able to deploy the system in Mr. Reagan's term, it might be called ""the greatest sting in history."" But it
wasn't a ruse at all. And my statement in no way suggested any lack of support for the program. Indeed it was my
responsibility to make it succeed.
Obviously, that the Strategic Defense Initiative might lead the Soviets to make concessions was a hope without
guarantee. But trying it was worth the risk, because we would begun research and development on a system that
someday we would need for a different, but foreseeable threat.
That day has come. The threat is substantially different and not as large, but North Korea and soon two or three
other rogue states will present a serious nuclear threat.
Seventeen years of research has allowed us to cover a lot of ground on missile defense. Still more work is needed
before a decision on deployment is made. Research on both the Navy's Aegis sea-based system and its landbased
counterpart should be pursued more aggressively than current financing allows.
A delay will also provide useful time in which a new government in Washington can engage with the new Russian
government and reach a mutually beneficial basis for modifying the outdated ABM treaty. My recommendation
would be to share our technology with them so that they could use it too -- as President Reagan intended to do.
Once testing and the bilateral negotiations are completed successfully, a decision can be made.
At that point Congress should finance deployment of a robust missile-defense system. Thanks to President
Reagan's vision and determination, the means of our defense are within reach.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,64,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846
"Sinnreich, Richard",,1,2000-07-09,1,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Honoring Uncommon Valor,"But every veteran knows how haphazard is the mere recognition of such conduct, let alone its comparative appaisal. For every award however justly earned, equally deserving conduct frequently is overlooked and undervalued. ","One rain-soaked morning on a hillside north of Tuy Hua in South Vietnam, as my howitzer battery conducted its
daily ""harassment and interdiction"" fire, a visiting officer stepped up to our water trailer to replenish his canteen.
Rain had softened the ground under the trailer's wheel chocks, and as the officer put his canteen to the spigot,
the battery fired. The concussion jarred the trailer against the chocks, and it rolled an inch or so, just enough to
crush the visitor's thumb between the spigot and the lip of his canteen. The injury was superficial and quickly
treated. Within minutes, all involved had forgotten about it--until the following week, when the officer discovered to
his embarrassed astonishment that he had beencited for the Purple Heart for ""injuries sustained in armed combat
against enemies of the United States.""
Most veterans of Vietnam (or any other recent conflict) could tell similar tales. Award citations long have been a
butt of the dark humor that helps soldiers cope with otherwise humorless conditions. As two recent controversies
remind us, however, military decorations and the way they are awarded are far from a joking matter. A few weeks
ago, some veterans' ire was aroused by the belated award of the Medal of Honor to 22 Asian Americans for
World War II heroics earlier honored with less prestigious medals. At almost the same time, a dispute arose over
the award of the Bronze Star for service in the Kosovo conflict to military personnel who hadn't set foot in the
Balkans.
That small bits of inexpensive metal strung from colored ribbons should generate such a hullabaloo testifies to the
sensitivity associated with military awards. Every leader is familiar with the problem. Nevertheless, despite
repeated efforts to refine the criteria and processes by which military merit is recognized, awards have been a
repeated source of criticism both within the ranks and outside them. Ironically, much of the reason can be traced
to the refinements themselves. Until the Civil War, our only military decoration was today's Purple Heart, first
awarded in 1783 not for wounds but rather for meritorious service in the Revolutionary War. Then, in 1861,
Congress approved the Medal of Honor to recognize gallantry, but scarcely in today's rarefied terms. At Vicksburg
in May 1863, for example, 96 soldiers earned the medal in a single day. A month later, the entire 27th Maine
received the medalfor agreeing to remain on duty after its enlistments had expired (an award later revoked). Not
until July 1918 did Congress adopt the now familiar formula, ""at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty.""
That same legislation also established several lesser awards, to which many others have been added over the
years. Developed with the best of intentions, it is this ""Pyramid of Honor"" that has prompted most of the problems
associated with awards. In effect, it replaced a relatively straightforward judgment--that certain military conduct
deserved recognition--with a much more difficult question: How much recognition compared with someone else's
similar conduct?
The two award controversies noted earlier are a case in point. The first reflected suspicion that Medal of Honor
standards were sacrificed in the effort to remedy World War II biases against Asian American soldiers. The
second reflected objections to awarding the same decoration to personnel with differing degrees of exposure to
combat. Both were only the most recent proof of the inherent difficulty associated with making qualitative
distinctions among similar acts performed in widely dissimilar circumstances.
Ancient armies may have been wiser. For most, awards for meritorious conduct were qualitatively
indistinguishable. Decorations such as the rings of honor awarded to Roman soldiers typically signified nothing
about the comparative merit of the conduct honored. Instead, they reflected only how often that conduct had been

repeated. Unlike our own award system, such a method recognized that comparing meritorious conduct in widely
differing circumstances invited resentment. Whereas honoring such conduct instead encouraged its repetition.
None of this is intended in any way to disparage those who have been honored for valor or service. But every
veteran knows how haphazard is the mere recognition of such conduct, let alone its comparative appraisal. For
every award however justly earned, equally deserving conduct frequently is overlooked or undervalued. In a
sense, Adm. Chester W. Nimitz's matchless tribute to the Marines at Iwo Jima--""Uncommon valor was a common
virtue""--might be considered a commentary on the entire award problem. It's a pity we have not yet managed to
devise a less contentious way of dealing with it.

War remains a contest less of machines than of competing minds and wills. The technology has yet to be devised that a determined enemy cannot outfit.","In ""A War To Be Won,"" their new one-volume account of World War II, historians Williamson Murray and Allan
Millett offer the following comment about military planning: ""One of the great myths of military history is that
military organizations prepare for the next war by studying the last war and that is why they perform badly.""
Murray and Millett go on to note that, of the major European belligerents in 1939, only Germany (and the Soviet
Union until Stalin purged its officer corps) made a systematic effort to study the tactical and operational lessons of
World War I. As a result, when blitzkrieg--lightning war--burst upon the world, it was revolutionary only to its
victims.
That bit of history may be peculiarly relevant at a time when some optimists seem bent on discovering a military
revolution under every technological rock, and when the most common criticism of the U.S. military is that it
remains mired in the Cold War. Actually, nothing could be further from the truth. If the Cold War is defined by its
principal shooting engagements--Korea and Vietnam--whatever impact it once had on American military thinking
seems largely to have evaporated during the past 10 years. That's unfortunate, because a good case can be
made that those conflicts have more to teach us about future warfare than more recent episodes such as the Gulf
War or Kosovo, one-sided scrimmages against opponents whose military fecklessness was exceeded only by
that of their political leadership.
What made the shooting battles of the Cold War so painful by comparison had relatively little to do with
technology. Technological disparities in recent conflicts, while greater than in Korea and Vietnam, weren't that
much greater, and recent research has discounted much of their impact in any case. Instead, the real difference
in what transpired on the battlefield had more to do with military skill--that and the strategic acumen and intestinal
fortitude of military and political leaders.
Indeed, the superlative performance of U.S. forces in recent conflicts can be attributed in no small measure to the
intense and often painful military self-analysis that followed defeat in Southeast Asia. As then-Maj. Gen. Barry
McCaffrey pointed out in congressional testimony after the Gulf War, the seeds of victory in 1991 were sown in
the military renaissance that began after Vietnam.
That renaissance included new weapons, but it was not primarily technological. Rather, it reflected a concerted
effort by the military to correct deficiencies at every level, from the training of individuals and units to the selection
and education of leaders, to the principles governing their employment. The Air Force's integrated air campaign,
the Army's air-land battle doctrine and the revitalized Marine air-ground task force were a few of its products.
Central to that corrective process was a renewed appreciation of history--of the need to absorb the lessons of the
past to avoid mismanaging the future. Officers returned to Clausewitz and Sun Tzu, Mahan and Corbett, Mitchell
and Douhet, and to critical histories of Korea and Vietnam by writers such as T. R. Fehrenbach, S. L. A. Marshall
and Harry Summers.
Technological innovation certainly mattered. Without the Reagan buildup, military revitalization would have been
crippled. But unlike the ""revolutions"" of the late '50s and early '60s, which essentially discarded as irrelevant
history earlier than Hiroshima, the renaissance of the '70s and '80s framed technology in terms of war's enduring
imperatives.

Today's military planners need to recapture that balance, which to some extent has been lost since the Gulf War.
War remains a contest less of machines than of competing minds and wills. The technology has yet to be devised
that a determined enemy cannot outwit.
Nor can we count on a continuing dearth of clever adversaries. One of these days we will find ourselves facing
not a Saddam Hussein or Slobodan Milosevic but a Lin Biao or Vo Nguyen Giap. When that day comes, victory
will depend less on who has the more capable electronics or more precise missiles than on which side
understands when and how those technological advantages really matter.
For that purpose, military planners--and political leaders as well--could do a lot worse than mire themselves in the
Cold War.

","Just two years ago, on Aug. 7, 1998, international terrorists simultaneously bombed the American Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, killing more than 200 people. Those catastrophic acts were unrelated to east Africa and were directed at the Americans there solely because they were deemed vulnerable. This anniversary should remind us of the danger confronting our people and our diplomacy all over the world.

As we enter the 21st century, nearly 10 million Americans are vacationing, living or working outside our country's borders. Obviously, our global interests require us to be a leader in the international community. This reality was evident in the Middle East Summit at Camp David, the efforts to control the worldwide AIDS epidemic, the North Korean-South Korean peace talks, and the many new trade and financial arrangements spanning the globe. However, our ability to lead and effectively pursue America'saffairs abroad is seriously affected by the vulnerability of our embassies and consulates overseas.

In 1998-99, I chaired the Accountability Review Board, formed to investigate the 1998 east African embassy bombings. Few have challenged the board's findings that the United States must spend about $1.4 billion a year for the next 10 years to improve the security of its diplomatic missions overseas. The bipartisan leadership in Congress and the Clinton administration have acknowledged the threat facing Americans who serve abroad. Independent studies by the Stimson Center, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel have confirmed those concerns.

Much has been done in the past two years. However, based on the status of the appropriations bills in Congress, we are going to be $200 million to $500 million short of the minimum funding called for by our recommendations. In recognition of this stark reality and the billions of additional dollars now available in the surplus for next year, the American Foreign Service Association has identified $200 million of new one-time-only programs that would markedly improve the safety and security of Americanpresence and interests overseas. It recommends spending $100 million more for perimeter security to help 55 posts meet basic security standards and another $100 million for better glass protection, which would address the single most devastating cause of injury and death in terrorist attacks. These relatively modest one-time-only expenditures are practical steps that we can take now to significantly and permanently increase embassy security in more than 100 posts throughout the world.

The dedicated men and women of our Foreign Service do not ask for the impossible--a 100 percent guarantee of safety. They are committed to overseeing U.S. interests worldwide and to going where they are needed, often in hardship, and despite terrorist threats, disease and family separation.

But as we ask our fellow Americans to take these risks, our government in turn must do everything possible to ensure the maximum degree of safety possible for them and other U.S. citizens overseas. Congress should take advantage of our new surplus to provide the full $1.4 billion needed this year to improve security for the dedicated men and women who represent our republic abroad. While managing funds wisely is always in order, our primary focus should be on the saving of lives.

We also believe that this force superiority can be sustained at current budget levels…","During this political season, it has become popular to lament the ""decline of America's military forces."" This theme has been sounded so often that the public may be misled into believing that it is true, and so to believe that Americans' security is endangered.

In fact, the U.S. military is the most powerful military force in the world today. What is true is that there has been a sizable reduction in U.S. military forces. Earlier reductions after World War II and the Vietnam War were done so precipitously that, in Army parlance, they ""broke the force."" So it is fair to ask whether this last reduction, executed during the Bush administration and the first term of the Clinton administration, was of an appropriate size and whether it was done effectively.

We believe that the answer to both of these questions is yes. Underlying the reduction in military forces was a reduction in military needs brought about by the ending of the Cold War. America no longer needed the huge body of troops massed along the East-West German border. After the Cold War, the Warsaw Pact dissolved, and the Soviet Union reverted to 15 separate republics. Most of these former foes have friendly relations with the United States; none of them has either the capability or intent of attacking Western Europe.

This dramatic reduction in the threat allowed for a reduction in American troops based in Western Europe by more than 200,000, with comparable reductions in stateside troops. Strategic nuclear forces were also cut by a third, and the major programs underway to develop, test and produce additional nuclear weapons were terminated. These actions allowed for a significant reduction in the size of our military forces.

President Bush authorized a reduction of 500,000, President Clinton an additional 250,000, leaving a force of 1,450,000. In both administrations, this reduction was executed gradually (about 3 percent a year) and with great care not to break the force. During this same period, a related drawdown was being made in the Defense Department's civil service, amounting to a reduction of 400,000 civilian personnel. And, under the Base Realignment and Closure Act, more than 100 bases were closed, beginning in 1988.

The most obvious benefit of these reductions in force and support structure was a reduction in the defense budget. If these reductions had not been made, the current defense budget would be almost $400 billion instead of almost $300 billion. This ""peace dividend,"" amounting to about $100 billion a year, has been a major contributor to the balanced budget that our country now enjoys. The question, of course, is did the nation pay too high a price for this benefit? In particular, was the capability of the military forces reduced to the extent that they cannot adequately protect American national interests?

Our answer to that question is an emphatic no. The reductions made in both the Bush administration and Clinton administration were done carefully, gradually and with great attention to maintaining America's superb military capability. In particular, we offer the following judgments: The United States has the most capable conventional military force of any nation in the world (an opinion shared by most of the world's military leaders--friend and foe); the United States has the largest, most effective strategic nuclear force in the world today; the United States has a military force today that, person for person, unit for unit, is more capable than the comparable force during the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Cold War; and the United States has a military force that is capable of dealing decisively with any likely regional conflict (and the convincing demonstration of this capability in Desert Storm, Bosnia and Kosovo decreases the likelihood of such a confrontation).

That is the good news, but it is not cause for complacency. The nature of the military threat could change; in particular, regional powers, realizing that they cannot match American troops on the field, may turn to asymmetric warfare, developing weapons of mass destruction or cyber warfare.

Also, during the force reductions of the '90s, we reduced the procurement budget disproportionately in order to preserve force readiness. This was an appropriate decision at that time, but its legacy today is a due bill as our military equipment ages. Substantial increases must be made in the procurement account to modernize equipment at an accelerated rate, since the aging equipment is itself becoming a readiness problem. This has been recognized both by the Department of Defense and Congress, and procurement authorizations have increased from $40 billion to $60 billion during the past two years. In our judgment, these authorization levels will have to be sustained for a number of years at this level or somewhat higher to effectively recapitalize the force.

Finally, the key to our force effectiveness is the quality and training of our military personnel. These have been under stress the past few years with the boom in the economy creating much more formidable competition for military personnel. As a result, both recruitments and reenlistments have fallen below desirable levels. The recent increase in military benefits, while costly, was the right thing to do and undoubtedly was one of the critical factors involved in correcting this problem.

In sum, we believe that the United States has the military force needed to protect the national interest and to sustain the U.S. position as the world's superpower. We also believe that this force superiority can be sustained at current budget levels (but to do so will take careful management by the Defense Department and uncommon discipline by Congress). While American defense spending is (in current dollars) about $100 billion a year less than Cold War levels, it is still greater than the combined defense budgets of Russia, China, Germany and France. As a result of this investment, combined with the U.S. military's advantage in technology and training, the United States today has the dominant military force in the world, and whichever nation is second is far behind.",10,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,64,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846
"Odom, William",1988,1,2000-08-11,1,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Buchanan Has it Backwards on Globalization,"Do multinational corporations and globalization erode the sovereignty of the U.S.? Patrick Buchanan and the Reform Party think so. But the fledgling party, now in the middle of a disorganized California convention, has it backwards.","Do multinational corporations and globalization erode the sovereignty of the U.S.? Patrick Buchanan and the Reform Party think so. But the fledgling party, now in the middle of a disorganized California convention, has it backwards.

Globalization enhances U.S. sovereignty because it increases American power, the best security for American liberties. To be against globalization is effectively to be against what the country has stood for and worked toward for much of two centuries. Antiglobalism has its intellectual roots in Jeffersonian agrarianism, which would have kept us poor and dependent on British globalization.

The sovereignty question is a red herring. Sovereignty has never been total for any country. All countries surrender some sovereignty when entering international agreements, be it the International Telegraph Union or the Geneva Convention on the laws of war. They adhere to such treaties because they receive more in return than they surrender.

Unrestricted sovereignty is as absurd as unrestricted individual liberties. We may be willing to die for our liberties, but we also accept limits on them. If we did not, someone else's exercise of liberties would destroy our own. This is so elementary that one wonders how it can be lost on Mr. Buchanan and his supporters.

Over the past century, when the U.S. had fewer limits on its sovereignty it was poorer; when it had more, it was richer. In the 1930s it had few treaty commitments, having rejected the Versailles treaty and the League of Nations. Congress even passed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs to keep out foreign trade. And what rewards did all these exercises of sovereignty give the American worker? The worst economic depression of the century followed by the bloodiest war in history.

By comparison, consider the 1997-98 financial crisis that began in Thailand and spread to other countries. Why did it not lead to a repetition of the 1930s? Precisely because today a number of international organizations -- the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the G-7, to name a few -- facilitate interventions that prevent such economic depressions. They may not work perfectly, but they certainly staunched that financial crash.

While the U.S. built these sovereignty-limiting arrangements shortly after World War II to improve the security of the Western world, they have also facilitated unprecedented economic growth in Europe, East Asia and North America.

Another set of sovereignty-limiting organizations -- U.S. military alliances -- have been equally important for this massive increase in our wealth. By maintaining peace among old enemies in Europe and East Asia, they lower business transaction costs in both regions, greatly encouraging international trade. All Americans are vastly richer and more secure today than they would have been without U.S. military forces deployed in Europe and Asia.

Ignoring these economic benefits, Mr. Buchanan condemns our military allies for ""free-riding"" on the U.S. defense budget. They do free-ride, although not as much as believed. But Mr. Buchanan cannot explain why, in spite of all their free-riding, the U.S. has become much wealthier and stronger than they have. Why have his supporters' incomes increased so much? If this is what such free-riding produces, we should encourage our allies to keep it up.

Nor can Mr. Buchanan explain why so many Americans move into higher-paying, white-collar jobs as the lower paying jobs are performed by workers in other countries. If he and the Reform Party succeeded in stopping globalization in Latin America and Asia, many more illegal immigrants from that region will come to take those blue-collar jobs in the U.S. Then, of course, he would rant and rave against immigrants. Globalization, by providing jobs in poor countries, keeps more of their citizens at home.

Why does Mr. Buchanan fail to notice that more and more countries in the world line up to surrender their sovereignty to this U.S.-managed system? They ask to be admitted, even though the U.S. and its wealthier allies earn more from it than they do, because they also gain.

Globalization doesn't work only because of some international ""invisible hand,"" or what Thomas Friedman calls the ""electronic herd."" It works because the U.S. secures increasing acceptance of liberal legal and economic institutions in the international system. Through them, the U.S. is able to provide the kind of governance without which markets cannot work effectively. These are the very institutions that allowed this country to rise from its beginnings as an agrarian economy at the end of the 18th century to the world's wealthiest country.

The policies of Jefferson would have kept us there, farmers exploited by Britain's banks and industrializing economy. Hamilton's Federalists wanted to make our financial institutions strong, our industrialization rapid and our international trade profitable, eventually allowing the U.S. to replace Britain as the world's strongest power.

Globalization, which increases both U.S. power and Americans' standard of living, is the logical development of Hamiltonian institutions. Mr. Buchanan seeks the logical development of Jeffersonian institutions, making the U.S. a vastly poorer and less secure, but fully sovereign, country. Admittedly, globalization has disturbing social consequences that need to be mitigated. But what's the alternative? A reduction in everybody's wealth and security. That would be the consequence of Mr. Buchanan's policies.",9,ForeignPolicy,,,,1,,The author is criticizing a position held by a Presidential candidate. ,64,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846
"Sinnreich, Richard",,1,2000-08-14,1,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,False Fights About Readiness,Army readiness has become something of a shell game.  ,"The first week of August was an interesting one. On Thursday a presidential candidate, who counts among his
advisers a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, criticized the unreadiness of two Army divisions. The
following day the current chairman said that, to the contrary, all Army divisions are combat-ready. Citizens
scratched their heads and wondered what in the world is going on.
The answer is that Army readiness has become something of a shell game. For one thing, readiness in an
everyday sense and readiness in the more formal sense of readiness reporting are not identical. Readiness
reporting focuses primarily on resources--personnel, equipment and consumables such as fuel and ammunition.
Its purpose is to identify shortfalls and ensure that available resources are allocated first to the units likely to need
them most urgently in the event of war.
But it is possible for two equally well-resourced units to be at different levels of real combat readiness. For
example, a division whose subordinate elements have just returned from advanced tactical training at the
National Training Center may be readier to fight than one whose units haven't had that opportunity. Contrariwise,
a division that has had nearly a third of its strength deployed on peacekeeping duty for months may be less ready
for war than a division that hasn't. Moreover, even in terms of resources, readiness is relative, not absolute. Unit
readiness requirements vary according to how quickly units are expected to deploy in the event of war. Since
resources, especially personnel, rarely are sufficient in peacetime to keep all units at full strength, some units are
maintained at lower readiness than others.
Even so, qualified as it is, reported readiness can become politically controversial, as the episode earlier this
month reveals. Accordingly, a few months ago, after two divisions were rated unready by reason of insufficient
personnel, the Army reluctantly decided to man all 10 divisions at 100 percent, at the expense of non-divisional
units and organizations.
Hence, the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Tex., today is close to its authorized strength. But III Corps Artillery
at Fort Sill, Okla., which furnishes most of the long-range fire support for that division and one other, is closer to
half strength. The same deliberate under manning afflicts other non-divisional combat units, to say nothing of
Army schools, training centers, depots and so on.
Divisions are the point of the Army's fighting spear. But as with any spear, power comes from the shaft--in this
case, the combat support and logistical units that sustain those divisions in battle. So that even if all 10 divisions
technically are combat ready, as the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman insists, that doesn't guarantee they could go to
war today and win.
Well, so what? With no major war looming on the horizon, what real difference does it make that most of the
non-divisional Army is under manned? As it does so often, that depends on how you look at it. From a global
perspective, the Army isn't ready to execute a national military strategy that calls for fighting two major regional
wars nearly simultaneously. Indeed, using Desert Storm as a yardstick, few believe that the Army could manage
even one such war without a prolonged buildup.
Some discount the formal strategic requirement, however, especially given improved relations between the two
Koreas, while others would rely on air power to buy whatever time may be needed in a crisis to put the Army back
into fighting trim. For both, hollowing out the non-divisional Army is an acceptable risk, especially if the alternative
is spending more money.
Page 28 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
At the foxhole level, these arguments miss the point: Personnel shortages tend to compound. Like most Army
units, for example, III Corps Artillery at any given moment has roughly a third of its troops in the field and another
third in preparatory training. The remainder furnish the logistical services required to support the others' activities
and maintain a busy post, from replacing targets to mowing the grass.
When manning levels plummet, however, this system breaks down. Half-strength units can't train effectively. In a
rocket battery, for example, either half the launchers must be left unmanned and their crews redistributed or their
ammunition carriers must be left in the motor pool. Meanwhile, units in support cycle likewise lack the manpower
to perform needed tasks, so they end up borrowing soldiers from units preparing for the field. That further
degrades training, while the resulting turbulence puts immense strain not only on soldiers but also on their
families.
The inevitable result is that frustrated soldiers leave the Army, taking their skills with them, and the problem gets
worse. That is exactly what is happening today, and no matter who is technically right, sterile arguments about
divisional combat readiness won't do much to correct it.

His allies in the military clearly helped him come to power, and this leaves the Russian president with some very difficult choices.","William E. Odom, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and adjunct professor of political science at Yale, is author of ''The Collapse of the Soviet Military.'' A retired Army general, he was director of the National Security Agency from 1985 to 1988.

The Russian submarine disaster in the Barents Sea has been more than a human tragedy. It has also been a test of the true character of President Vladimir Putin and his senior military. Judging just by their arrogant public handling of the crisis in its first days, he and his commanders have again confirmed the worst.

As the news first unfolded, the commanders issued conflicting accounts of the sinking of the Kursk submarine, and for days Mr. Putin issued no statement at all. Although we still don't know the details of what caused the disaster, we do know enough about the context to speculate about the larger implications.

The rundown state of the Russian military is no surprise. For years there have been revelations about suicides in the military ranks, cruel abuses of first-year conscripts and corruption in the senior officer corps. The Committee of Russian Soldiers' Mothers bravely collects and publishes such information in the face of the military's hostility. At the same time, generals and admirals complain that Russian youths are insufficiently patriotic and that the defense budget is too low. As officers skim off money for personal gain, unit training and weapons maintenance as well as procurement of new arms are woefully neglected. Not only are most of the ships in poor repair, but many sailors and junior officers have rarely or maybe never been at sea.

Why then did the admirals risk launching a large, complex naval exercise in the Barents Sea?

The answer may lie in the Russian navy's competition with the land-based nuclear strategic forces for scarce resources. The power struggle began as a result of Boris Yeltsin's half-hearted effort to reform the military.

Under Mr. Yeltsin, it was a two-sided fight between the strategic nuclear forces and the conventional ground forces over who controls all the services and over budget priorities. Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev had the advantage under Mr. Yeltsin. He created an independent command for the land-based nuclear rockets, bought new long-range ballistic missiles and cut the conventional forces. More recently, the chief of the general staff, Anatoli Kvashnin, a commander in the first war in Chechnya, seemed to be making a comeback for the conventional forces.

Under Mr. Putin, however, the struggle has become three-sided. Inspired by his rhetoric about being a world-class naval power, the admirals insist that their missile-equipped submarines, rather than the land-based rocket forces, should be Russia's main nuclear deterrent.

In late July, the quarrel between Marshal Sergeyev and General Kvashnin became conspicuously public. Mr. Putin let them abuse each other in the media for several days before a security council meeting on Aug. 11 when he reportedly imposed a compromise between the nuclear rocket forces and the conventional forces.

Then word leaked out that he had given the navy an edge over the land-based rockets, which would be reduced and eventually folded into the air forces. The large exercise in the Barents Sea is likely related to the infighting. Ready or not, the commanders of submarines and ships may have been determined to demonstrate their capabilities to reassure Mr. Putin.

This interservice strife is largely of Mr. Putin's making. Last November he began talking about the navy's role in reviving Russia as a great power, and in recent remarks to naval personnel in Kaliningrad, he repeated that line. Mr. Putin has also sought to reassure the ground forces, beginning in the spring of 1999 with his support of its plans for an invasion of Chechnya. As the war boosted his popularity in the presidential race, he promised more money to the ground forces.

Although the costs of the war in Chechnya greatly exceeded expectations, the president continued his rhetoric about Russia's great-power status. Encouraging the expectations of both the admirals and the ground-forces generals, he also signed the new national security doctrine that appeared to give priority to the strategic rocket forces.

Little wonder the generals and admirals have been ebullient about Mr. Putin. They were unable to avoid the huge cuts in the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras, and for nearly 15 years, they have hoped that eventually the military would again take first place in devouring the state budget.

The question is whether Mr. Putin can provide money as well as the moral support. Russia's regional governors are already warning him that he cannot use their tax money for that purpose. Alternatively, he might purge scores of senior officers, as opposed to a token few, and make the military live within the state's means. This seems unlikely. How is he to assert control over the regions, collect more taxes, and break the influence of the oligarchs without military support?

Moreover, his popularity is now at stake. Although most Russians want him to reduce crime and cut corruption, soldiers' mothers, fathers and wives do not share his affection for the military and secret police. The tragedy of the Kursk and Mr. Putin's brazen reaction to it are bound to reinforce their dislike of the military and may also hurt his highly favorable public opinion ratings.

Whatever the technical causes of the sinking of the Kursk, the event confronts Mr. Putin with a political crisis.

As a 30-year veteran of the United States military, I'm glad that national security has become an issue in the presidential campaign. But I'm disheartened that the debate as it has played out so far has been far more partisan than enlightening.

Al Gore has said, ''Our military is the strongest and the best in the entire world.''

But in a speech on Wednesday, Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential nominee, said the Clinton administration had neglected national defense and was ''running down'' the military.

This echoes statements by George W. Bush that today's servicemen and women battle ''back-to-back deployments, poor pay, shortages of spare parts and equipment, and rapidly declining readiness.''

In his speech at the Republican convention, Mr. Bush charged that two of the Army's 10 divisions were not ready for a major war.

This sort of interchange does not begin to address the important defense challenges facing the nation. It exaggerates problems that don't threaten our national security while ignoring problems that do threaten it.

Let's examine the issues.

Lack of military readiness. Mr. Bush's charge that two army divisions were unprepared for war sounds serious, but is not particularly relevant. Every active duty force, every national guard and reserve unit is currently judged ready for combat according to a list of standards that are in many ways more appropriate for cold war missions and less appropriate for our troops that served in Bosnia, Kosovo and Rwanda. Troops need to be less like a tightly packed, hierarchical combat force, and more like a sophisticated, flexible police force.

Moreover, the list of standards fails to include equipment that may be especially important in today's missions, like high technology information systems, defenses against chemical and biological weapons and adequate numbers of precision weapons.

The Clinton administration has spent too much money to assure that our forces can, by and large, meet this outdated standard -- even troops who would not, in any circumstance, be used for months into a conflict. Certainly, the fact that all units don't meet every standard means far less than politicians may imply, and our current level of readiness is certainly not a significant threat to our national security.

Too many missions around the world. True, our forces are deployed too broadly, in dozens of places around the globe. And some units are overextended. But the grand mass of the American military is not deployed. The percentage of troops overseas is small. With management, both people and money could be moved from other parts of the services into overextended units.

Low morale and poor recruitment. We need to do more for our troops, including increasing their pay. And it is difficult to recruit and retain people, especially in a hot economy. But over the last decade, the military has been able to maintain its fighting force, and in the coming year, the services are expected to meet their recruiting goals. Moreover, today's morale, while low and needing attention, is not the kind of issue that is likely to bring down our national security. The situation today is not the post-Vietnam military that many decry.

A failure to look ahead. So what issue should our presidential candidates be concerned with? The military's ability to meet challenges five to 15 years from now.

The Clinton administration, to avoid charges of military unreadiness, made sure that today, every division is combat-ready. But that required billions of dollars and precluded buying enough equipment -- ships, tanks, tents -- for the future. The military procurement budget has been cut by about 60 percent since the end of the cold war (the overall budget is down by only 35 percent).

Some of the results can be seen today. The average age of vehicles is much older than in the past. Indeed, some Marine and Army helicopters are older than the pilots who fly them. Because it takes many years to replace equipment, in 10 to 15 years, there could be 30 percent fewer airplanes, ships, tanks and trucks. The ones that do exist will be older -- and harder to keep running -- than the ones today.

Moreover, the military has been unable to invest in America's information technology. For instance, it has not been able to buy enough battlefield sensors and communications, which would allow commanders to have information about an entire battlefield.

Both the White House and the Republican Congress are responsible for this situation. Our presidential candidates should address it. And the next administration and Congress should fix it.",10,Warfighting,1,,,,,The author is urging Congress and the President to fix the military's readiness issues. ,64,106,1999,0.777157183,0.658369565,23.2628297,34.056846

America's armed forces find themselves struggling to maintain readiness for increasingly unlikely conflicts, while short shrift is given to any preparation for emerging threats. The solution does not lie in throwing money at a flawed strategy. Instead we need a new strategy, with a determined focus on today's threats and tomorrow's challenges. We don't need a rich man's approach to defense, we need a thinking man's approach.","The Bush and Gore campaigns are trading salvos over the state of our military's readiness. This is an emotional issue, in part because the price of unpreparedness has often been paid in blood. But the current debate is poorly focused. It is centered more on the American military's ability to address Cold War requirements than on meeting the challenges now emerging. The question is not ""Is our military ready?"" but ""Ready for what?""

Our armed forces still employ Cold War yardsticks to determine force readiness. In some cases, of course, they do so with reason. The flight-hours logged annually by pilots, an Army brigade's performance at the National Training Center, or the number of people being recruited are important indicators of near-term readiness.

By these criteria, the military's readiness today appears much closer to that of the force that vanquished Iraq in 1990 than to that of the ""hollow"" military that flubbed the rescue of the Iranian hostages in 1980. The Republican ticket's repeated assertions that military readiness and morale are ""at dangerously low levels"" would appear to be unfounded. But George W. Bush's and Dick Cheney's contention that the military is ""in decline"" rests on stronger footing.

Some disturbing red flags have popped up in recent years. Army captains are leaving the service at a record rate. The Navy is having trouble retaining its pilots. Mission-capable rates for Air Force weapons systems have declined by 10% over the last decade. And the retention of service personnel with key skills remains a pressing problem. Gen. Edward ""Shy"" Meyer, who coined the phrase ""hollow military,"" noted that there is a tipping point at which readiness no longer declines gracefully, but instead does so precipitously. We may be approaching that point soon.

All of this, of course, begs my central question: Ready for what? We do not want a force that is organized, trained, equipped, and prepared to fight yesterday's battles. From this perspective, the readiness picture is even less encouraging.

Concerns have been raised over the readiness levels of Army divisions, two of which were rated C4 last fall (i.e., not ready to fulfill their wartime missions). But what are the Army's wartime missions? Last spring, the military was required at short notice to deploy an Army ground force at the Albanian border with Kosovo. It was unable to do so.

Even if all the Army's divisions had been at full strength and rated ""fully ready,"" not one could have been in place at the border quickly enough. Army leaders are now struggling to transform their divisions so they can be deployed rapidly, and thus be more ""strategically relevant,"" to use Pentagon parlance. Unfortunately, this will likely take years, and the Army has yet to explain how it will fund its transformation.

And what of tomorrow's threats? We have built, and are continuing to build, a military that is ready to deploy massive combat power to forward bases in times of crisis or war, as we planned to do during the Cold War and did during the Gulf War. In fact, it is a cornerstone of the Clinton administration's defense project that we be able to wage two Desert Storm-like wars at the same time.

Yet several blue-ribbon defense panels have given warning that, as more and more militaries acquire ballistic and cruise missiles, they will, absent fantastic progress on our missile defenses, be able to inflict high rates of destruction on those bases. Would-be enemies will not try to field armor forces to defeat our tanks, or air forces to engage our advanced fighters in dogfights. Rather, they will pursue an asymmetric approach, investing in ballistic and cruise missile forces that can be dispersed and used to strike the ports and airfields at which our reinforcing troops would arrive, and where our aircraft would be based.

At present we are not ready to confront this challenge. Under such conditions, even if our Army divisions and our Air Force squadrons were fully manned and equipped, they would, as configured today, be likely to confront a 21st-century version of the carnage at Omaha Beach. Will we ever be ready to meet this emerging ""anti-access"" challenge, the overcoming of which has been described by Admiral Jay Johnson, the former Chief of Naval Operations, as ""the single most crucial element in projecting U.S. power where it is needed""?

William Cohen, the secretary of defense, has declared that his vision is to ""transform"" the American military, so that it will be prepared to meet this, and other, emerging threats. This will be achieved, he contends, largely by exploiting the potential of the ""revolution in military affairs"" brought about by new information-technology, and by conducting large-scale, transformative field exercises, or experiments, that involve the four military services. From this, we will be able to determine how new and existing capabilities can best prepare our military to meet emerging threats.

Unfortunately, the Pentagon's actions have not matched its rhetoric. Modernization plans remain essentially as they were six years ago. The Army's focus on creating units that can be deployed to forward bases more rapidly may yield the equivalent of a George Custer urging his troops to advance more quickly at Little Bighorn.

The Navy is only beginning to come to grips with the challenge posed by Adm. Johnson, who also sees an adversary equipped with increasingly sophisticated anti-ship mines, stealthy diesel submarines, and high-speed anti-ship cruise missiles. These weapons will make any transit through choke points such as the Strait of Hormuz an increasingly risky proposition for the huge aircraft carriers that are the backbone of our fleet.

To complete the disturbing picture, the Air Force's top priority is to spend more than $200 billion modernizing its short-range aircraft, even though they will operate from increasingly vulnerable forward bases. During his tenure as the Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Ronald Fogleman warned that such a course of action ""might deter U.S. and coalition partners from responding to aggression in the first instance.""

As for conducting training to prepare for emerging threats, the Pentagon's approach is one of benign neglect. Only in 1998, after bipartisan pressure from Congress, did the Pentagon designate a command to be responsible for ""joint experimentation,"" the term for transformation field exercises. The command promptly scheduled its first major exercise -- for 2004, leaving the military services to fend for themselves in the mean time. As a result, we have squandered a valuable opportunity to test promising ideas for dealing with emerging threats.

In short, the glaring flaw in the U.S. military today is not its readiness, but its strategy. America's armed forces find themselves struggling to maintain readiness for increasingly unlikely conflicts, while short shrift is given to any preparation for emerging threats. The solution does not lie in throwing money at a flawed strategy. Instead we need a new strategy, with a determined focus on today's threats and tomorrow's challenges. We don't need a rich man's approach to defense, we need a thinking man's approach.

Then we need to direct that the armed forces be structured, equipped and trained for the missions expected. This means moving farther way from the Cold War force structures. It means lighter weight, more mobile forces and increased investment in high technology. It also means more efficient, streamlined training. And it probably means some additional funding and personnel.","The debate over military readiness is starting to address the real issues. First there were the charges that two
Army combat divisions weren't ready. Then it was explained that this was an administrative quirk: These divisions
weren't ""ready"" because they were actually doing important military work on the ground in Bosnia and Kosovo.
Then everyone seemed to be saying that we have the finest military in the world. As the former U.S. and NATO
commander in Europe for the past three years, I certainly agree.
Now we're hearing concerns about what the military should be doing and how it will fare in the future. The charge
seems to be that the administration is running down the armed forces by deploying them too often. And so the
issue seems to be this: How should the armed forces be used? What is it that we should be ready for? And this in
turn, is going to be a debate about U.S. leadership in an ever-changing world.
It's high time we had this debate and settled the issue.
We need continuing American leadership, and we need to provide the resources the armed forces and our other
institutions need for the task. And if we're going to lead, we have to deal with problems abroad while they're small
and manageable, not wait until major war is required. But for this we need a bipartisan consensus.
After the Cold War, we drew down our military forces by over a third. As a nation we took the opportunity to
realize a peace dividend and balance the budget.
For some the end of the Cold War has meant that most of America's armed forces should return home and
prepare for the next conflict. Then, if America's survival is at risk, or if there is clear aggression against our allies
and we are obligated to respond, our forces will deploy and strike.
For others, success in the Cold War has meant that America's forces are now available to help deal with other
problems abroad. They believe the armed forces exist not just to fight America's wars but also to serve American
interests in other ways.
The fact is that since the end of the Cold War there have been many problems abroad affecting U.S. interests,
and U.S. military forces have addressed them without engaging in major regional conflict--in Bosnia, Kosovo,
Korea, Iraq, Rwanda, Haiti, East Timor and other places.
For the military, this required having the capability to dominate the full spectrum of military operations, from
peacekeeping in the Sinai to war fighting on a major scale. It has required occupying, patrolling, supporting,
sustaining and securing, as well as striking and destroying. And it's been more expensive and more demanding to
help out abroad than just to stay at home, downsizing the force and preparing for future all-out war.
So the real issue is about national purpose and strategy, not about readiness.
Five years ago most military leaders thought we had bridged the gap between these two distinctive views on the
use of our armed forces when we created a strategy of being ready for two nearly simultaneous major regional
conflicts. Congress and the public seemed to agree that we had to be able to respond to aggression against our
allies in the Far East and the Persian Gulf. And we believed that if we retained capabilities sufficient for these
responses, we would be able to take action elsewhere if needbe.
Page 34 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
But the issue wasn't bridged. In my former position as supreme allied commander in Europe, I could see the
anxious concern of European leaders as they watched our continuing and often highly partisan internal debate on
issues such as Bosnia, NATO enlargement and Kosovo. The struggle sowed confusion and vacillation abroad.
And our military watched also as our budget and supplemental appropriations were often held hostage to the
larger issues. We adjusted training, postponed facility repairs and frettedabout managing an uncertain budget.
In the military, we held off some needed restructuring to meet emerging commitments, in part because many
military leaders sensed a lack of national consensus on the larger issues of purpose and strategy. (Some in the
military railed privately against excessive commitments, but the truth was that only a small portion of the force
was actually committed.) We never made the kinds of adjustments in forces, equipment, training and sustainment
needed to meet the new requirements most efficiently. We emphasized readiness, but we retained an
administrative readiness reporting system little changed from the Cold War period, augmented by some
measurements of our requirements in case of major regional conflict.
Among leaders in Europe and Africa, where I served, and among ordinary people, too, there is continued respect
for American values and influence. For the most part, they seek the same security, opportunities and rights that
we enjoy. They would like our friendship and respect. Sometimes, they ask our assistance, especially when their
problems affect us too. And occasionally, they seek American leadership. But today they want to know where we
stand and where we're headed.
More than 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we owe that to them. And we also owe it to the men and
women of the armed forces. They've been the pawns in this debate too long.
We need a bipartisan consensus on America's role and strategy in the world. Then we need to direct that the
armed forces be structured, equipped and trained for the missions expected. This means moving farther way from
the Cold War force structures. It means lighter weight, more mobile forces and increased investment in high
technology. It also means more efficient, streamlined training. And it probably means some additional funding and
personnel.
This is, in part, about money. In an economy ripe with budget surplus, let's not impose a false parsimony on those
men and women who have volunteered to put their lives on the line for us. We should provide the resources the
armed forces need to do their job and provide service members and their families with a standard of living that
reflects the wealth of this nation. We can afford it.
It is also about leadership. Don't think America can lead and influence events around the world if it doesn't pull its
weight in the difficult work of peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and participation in other international
institutions. Leadership is not just about reacting to aggression once it occurs--it's about preventing it where we
can, helping others in need and supporting those who share our values. This requires generosity of spirit and a
willingness to take risks. I believe America hasthe character and courage for these requirements of leadership.

"McFarlane, Robert",,0,2000-09-18,1,1,0,WaPO,Marine Corps,,,M,Vilifying Pakistan,…our country needs to engage both India and Pakistan in a sustained trialogue founded on goodwill and objectivity. ,"For those who have followed events in South Asia over the past 50 years it is painful to see a long-time friend and
ally being unfairly demonized [""Up the Ante on Pakistan,"" op-ed, Sept. 11]. For Arthur H. Davis to blame Pakistan
for turmoil in that region and to call for its designation as a ""terrorist state"" is perverse and unjustified under any
rational analysis of the facts. Worse, it contributes to polarization at a time when our country needs to engage both
India and Pakistan in a sustained trialogue founded on goodwill and objectivity.
Recently I met with Pakistan's chief executive, General Pervez Musharraf, in New York. Having met with each of his
elected predecessors on many occasions in the past 15 years, I can say that he stands well above them in terms of
honesty and integrity and a devotion to seeking peace and elevating the welfare of the Pakistani people.
In our meeting he reaffirmed his wish to conclude a negotiated peace with India in Kashmir and talked in detail
about his strategy for achieving political and economic reform in Pakistan. Indeed, much already has been achieved
toward these ends and much more can be done under his stewardship with encouragement and modest support
from the United States and others.
Our discussion of Kashmir focused on the presence of a half- million Indian troops in the valley and the decade-long
struggle by the Kashmiris, who face humiliation and oppression on a daily basis. Musharraf assured me that
Pakistan wants a peaceful solution to this desperate situation, one that respects the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
If India truly respects international norms and democratic principles and acts on its earlier commitment to uphold the
1949 United Nations Security Council resolution prescribing a plebiscite for the Kashmiris to decide on accession to
India or Pakistan, Musharraf surely will endorse the outcome.
Six weeks ago, a leading guerrilla group in Kashmir, the Hizbul Mujaheddin, proposed a three-month cease-fire in a
genuine effort to move the struggle from the battlefield to negotiations. To his credit, the response of Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was encouraging and offered a dialogue based on insaniyat (humanity). Regrettably,
at the insistence of his hard-line partisans, the terms for talks escalated to include the precondition that any
negotiations be held within the framework of the Indian constitution. To ask Kashmiris to accept the Indian
constitution is to preempt the purpose of talks: to achieve a solution that meets the aspirations of the Kashmiri
people in accordance with the U.N. resolution.
The United States has important interests in South Asia. With respect to Pakistan, our interests go beyond support
for a staunch ally in the Cold War--an ally who made enormous sacrifices measured in lives, the displacement of

more than 3 million refugees, and the spawning of a ruinous drug trade from Afghanistan. Since that victory, we
have essentially dismissed that sacrifice.
Both Pakistan and India could someday benefit enormously as the avenue of commerce for bringing the wealth of
central Asia to market in Europe and Japan. As for our interests in India, nurturing the successful development of
the world's largest democracy needs no further elaboration.
For these interests to be advanced, however, the United States must be--and be seen to be--a firm and objective
friend to both countries. The so-called new economy is passing these countries by. Without our help they both risk
becoming failed states. Sanctions and shrill rhetoric get us nowhere. It is time for the United States to lead on this
matter.

On the other hand, our concept of justice is that every citizen (even admirals) be accorded a fair trial, and that only those found guilty through a legal process be punished. For Adm. Kimmel, this is a judgment that Americans have yet to make.","For nearly 60 years, an American Navy officer, the late Rear Adm. Husband Kimmel, has been saddled with
much of the blame for the disaster visited upon the American fleet at Pearl Harbor by Japan's surprise attack.
Kimmel, the Navy commander on Oahu, was relieved of his command after the attack, as was the commander of
Army forces on Oahu, Lt. Gen. Walter Short. Although both were eventually absolved of dereliction of duty, they
were not allowed to retire at the highest wartime rank they had achieved. This has been seen by many, including
their families, as a stain on their records.
As the current Congress expires, long-overdue action is being taken to rectify the injustice done these two
officers. The Defense Authorization Act for 2001 includes a request that the president nominate Kimmel and Short
to their highest-held World War II ranks, thus giving them posthumous restoration of their honor and reputations.
The provision states clearly that these two officers performed their duties ""competently and professionally.""
Awhile back, the Naval Historical Foundation hosted a colloquium focused on the case of Kimmel and the degree
to which he should be held accountable for the events at Pearl Harbor. Many of the facts brought forth at the
gathering can also be applied by implication to the case of Short.
Participating in the colloquium were historians, authors and retired military officers representing the full span of
opinions on the matter, from those holding Kimmel fully responsible to those exonerating him and recommending
posthumous promotion to full admiral. Participants were in substantive agreement on a number of essential points
that, surprisingly, had not been emphasized in previous hearings:
* The naval forces in Hawaii had one-third the combat capability of the Japanese striking force.
* Kimmel's predecessor had been fired because he would not agree to Washington's decision to keep the fleet in
such a vulnerable location as Hawaii.
* Kimmel had been requesting additional ships and aircraft to enable the fleet to defend itself. His requests for
additional resources were routinely denied.
* Kimmel was not provided information from U.S. code breaking of significant developments pertinent to his
situation. His available force of patrol aircraft in Hawaii was insufficient to conduct effective reconnaissance
searches.
Even with some warning of an impending Japanese strike, Kimmel's only practical option would have been to
keep the fleet in harbor; venturing forth to engage the enemy would have resulted in even greater losses.
But to effectively protect the fleet in harbor, Kimmel would have needed at least four hours' warning to have his
fleet at general quarters at the time of the attack; he had to know almost exactly the time of the Japanese strike.
It is universal naval wisdom that crews cannot be kept at general quarters for more than 12 hours before their
fighting ability begins to deteriorate. With crews at battle stations for 24 hours without sleep, they become largely
ineffective. So, for any warning to be effective, it had to be accurate to within four to 24 hours prior to the actual
time of the first enemy strike.
Page 36 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Kimmel had been told that U.S. intelligence had developed the capability to break the Japanese codes, and he
had been assured that his superiors at the seat of government could be depended on to advise him when the
Japanese planned to attack.
Kimmel never received a warning of the Dec. 7 attack. He did receive a War Warning message sent by the Chief
of Naval Operations on Nov. 27, but the message was vaguely worded, capable of several interpretations and
even misleading. Nowhere in the message was there any suggestion of a Japanese move toward Hawaii.
It is patently clear that there were no alternative plans Kimmel could have made before the attack, or actions
taken that would have ensured a higher degree of readiness. Consequently, there could be no dereliction of duty
by him. There was no way the United States could have altered the outcome at Pearl Harbor.
Americans have every right--in fact, a responsibility--to exact accountability from their military commanders. On
the other hand, our concept of justice is that every citizen (even admirals) be accorded a fair trial, and that only
those found guilty through a legal process be punished. For Adm. Kimmel, this is a judgment that Americans have
yet to make.

"Clark, Wesley",2000,1,2000-12-08,1,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Risking the Alliance,"We should make crystal clear to the Europeans that we accept our responsibilities as a European power. We should state unequivocally that we will be there with NATO whenever there is a security challenge in Europe. And the Europeans should make clear in word and deed that NATO is the security and defense instrument of first choice. NATO is not yet a ""relic of history."" Time is short, but it's not too late.","A year ago, when leaders of the European Union announced the goal of fielding a 60,000-strong European force,
it seemed to some a possible answer to years of transatlantic squabbling about ""burden-sharing."" Now, as the
Europeans finish a year of organizing and designing the procedures for this force, we're hearing warnings about
the risk it poses to NATO.
In fact, American actions and attitudes contributed significantly to pushing the Europeans toward their goal of an
autonomous military capability. Let's face it, we've encouraged the Europeans to believe that we no longer feel
with the same strength the common interests that bound the alliance together for a half-century. We allowed the
Europeans to believe that in future security crises in Europe, we might not be there to help.
It's time to back up and put this in perspective. NATO was formed more than 50 years ago to protect Europe from
invasion and intimidation by Stalin's Red Army. In 1951, as Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower surveyed his new
command, he recognized that the Europeans--the British and the French--weren't doing enough to protect
themselves. Ever since then, ""burden-sharing"" has been debated within NATO. The end of the Cold War made
the argument more acute--and the wars in the Balkans brought it to a head.
When Yugoslavia fractured in bitter ethnic warfare in the early 1990s, American soldiers weren't there in the early
contingents of peacekeepers. It was seen as the first test of Europe's ability to take care of itself. But without
NATO support, U.N. peacekeepers, including our British and French allies, were no match for the ferocity of the
Serbs. And without U.S. diplomatic leadership, there was no resolution of the conflict.
It was the pledge of 25,000 American troops to participate on the ground in Bosnia that really brought about the
Dayton agreement to end the war. Still, the American contribution was controversial at home. American leaders
chided the Europeans privately and publicly. Europeans saw an isolationist tendency in Congress.
These frictions were even more present during the Kosovo campaign. There were myriad transatlantic
differences: what to strike, when and how much to escalate, when to plan for ground troops. The United States
sought to control the strikes--it was our intelligence and mostly our aircraft, after all. But the Europeans sought
their role, too--they were sharing in the military as well as the political risks. And they would pay the heaviest price
in refugees in the event of failure. The transatlantic linkage shuddered, but it didn't break.
The United States eventually led in Bosnia and in the air campaign against Yugoslavia for reasons of practical
necessity. But the longstanding frictions over burden-sharing were intensified by the United States' initial
reluctance to participate with ground troops in peace operations in Kosovo. When we finally agreed to join, on the
eve of the air campaign, we demanded what we thought would be the easiest sector. When it came time to enter
on the ground in June 1999, we were slow at the starting gate.Once into the mission, we carried a large
responsibility but complained about what we were asked to do.
In consequence, we are now arguing about how to plan and organize for future crises in which the Europeans will
send their forces--but we won't participate. At best, the Europeans will remove the deputy commander, planners
and key staff from the NATO chain of command headed by the American supreme allied commander, Europe, in
order to plan and head missions by a purely European rapid reaction force. But do we want a potentially split
NATO headquarters? With an American commander whose authority will always be subject to question, will the
United States continue to participate?
Page 40 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
At worst, the Europeans will create a new headquarters with additional planners and staff that will simply be
redundant and competitive to those within NATO.
These are the two bad alternatives at the center of the dispute. In reality, though, this is not a dispute about
arcane military forms and functions. It is about the strength of America's commitment to Europe and what we
expect in return.
By all means, we should avoid any duplication of NATO planning. But more important, we should avoid
misperceptions on either side of the Atlantic about changing interests. Both Europe and the United States need a
strong transatlantic relationship, defined by ""shared risks, shared burdens and shared benefits.""
We should make crystal clear to the Europeans that we accept our responsibilities as a European power. We
should state unequivocally that we will be there with NATO whenever there is a security challenge in Europe. And
the Europeans should make clear in word and deed that NATO is the security and defense instrument of first
choice. NATO is not yet a ""relic of history."" Time is short, but it's not too late.

Al Gore, of course, has shaped and supported Mr. Clinton's policy for eight years. The time has come, however, to adopt a new approach toward Russia.","A pseudo-Soviet normalcy is emerging in Russia as glasnost declines and perestroika gives way to new stagnation. All the while, the Clinton administration behaves like an enabler with an alcoholic, encouraging these trends. Consider a few items from past weeks reflecting the results of Clinton policies:

An American businessman, Edmund Pope, was wrongly convicted of spying in a kangaroo show trial while the U.S. government did virtually nothing to stop it. (President Vladimir Putin has said he might pardon him.) Spain has responded to Moscow's demand for the arrest and extradition of tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, not a cheering prospect for Russian and Western businessmen. Russian admirals continue to blame the West for the tragedy of the Kursk submarine, insisting that it collided with a foreign vessel. Yet two former submarine commanders told a newspaper that a collision couldn't cause such damage, and a secret report to the government attributed it to liquid fuel leaking from a torpedo that caught fire as the crew tried to load it.

On the diplomatic front, Russian officials offer ambiguous promises to limit arms sales to Iran coupled with efforts to enlist the U.S. against Islamic activists in Central Asia. Moscow has cut off supplies of electric power to Georgia and imposed a visa regime that blocks critical trade with that country. It also threatens military attacks inside Georgia against ""Chechen terrorists."" Mr. Putin revealed the underlying spirit of these actions by restoring the old Soviet national anthem, brushing aside many protests, including Boris Yeltsin's, that it is a symbol of Stalinism. (Imagine Germany readopting the Nazi Party's ""Horst Wessel Lied"" as its anthem.)

On the domestic front, Mr. Putin has created seven new regional administrations, headed by ex-KGB and military generals, designed to destroy the power of regional leaders. Nonloyalist governors are being investigated for criminal activity. Because most are guilty of some infraction, they either yield to blackmail or are forced to give way to the Kremlin's candidates. A recent example is Alexander Rutskoi who, as the governor of Kursk Oblast, was struck from the ballot by a court the day before the election.

Hand in glove with this centralization policy is the revival of state control of the press. Media Minister Mikhail Lesin has whittled away press freedoms, and a number of journalists have been tried on phony charges or murdered. The chief of the Russian Security Council recently condemned the ""totalitarian methods"" of the independent media, failing to note that they used such methods to insure Mr. Putin's election this spring.

Meanwhile, the war in Chechnya still festers. In May the foreign minister protested that Russia had nothing to hide in Chechnya; in November, Gen. Vladimir Shamanov affectionately described his command role there as ""a scavenger in a trash heap."" The head of the Russian parliament's audit chamber recently discovered that all the money earmarked for rebuilding Chechnya has been embezzled. The few reliable reports coming from Chechnya describe a wasteland of immeasurable human suffering, possibly beyond recovery, like Afghanistan.

Some Western observers are optimistic about the Russian economy, pointing to the increase in gross domestic product, which will reportedly be around 7% this year. This figure is partly attributable to rising oil prices and partly to the use of the ""purchasing power parity"" method of estimating GDP, which yields numbers far above reality. A better indicator of economic policy is postponement of the land code and cessation of most privatization (as well as some reversals). Meanwhile, the Russian stock market has dropped 20% since the first of the year, and most foreign investors have remained on the sidelines since the crash of 1998.

Critics will call this a biased picture, and indeed it is. It fails to convey adequately the perversity of Mr. Putin's policies. Although he clearly wants to, he cannot restore the old Soviet-style planned economy, but he can control the ""commanding heights,"" as Lenin referred to nationalized industry and the state bank. Today Mr. Putin has no disciplined party cadres of the Bolshevik sort, but he does have the cadres of the ex-KGB and the military. He is using them in all key appointments in precisely the way that Soviet leaders used party cadres.

He cannot, however, periodically purge them as Lenin and Stalin did to ensure discipline. This is apparent in his backing off of military reforms. The chechentsy (ground force generals who are veterans of the war in Chechnya), led by the chief of the general staff, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, are struggling against Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeev and his rocket-force officers for control of the ministry. Rather than stop this fight, Mr. Putin acts as a spectator.

The Russian president has also discovered a much larger military problem than he initially recognized: In addition to 1.2 million personnel in the Defense Ministry, he has 10 other uniformed organizations, making the total number of personnel in uniform over three million. Yet if he cuts them drastically, he will weaken a key source of political support. This probably explains why he tolerates the admirals' deceitful handling of the Kursk disaster.

Mr. Putin cannot restore the Soviet Union, but he can reassert control over the Caucasus and Central Asia and pursue troublemaking foreign policy unless the U.S. and Europe obstruct him. Inexplicably, the Clinton administration doesn't even try.

After using the International Monetary Fund for profligate capital assistance, exacerbating Russia's economic and political problems, the administration now ignores Russia's perverse behavior. Rumors are afoot in Washington that the Russians are peddling to sympathetic U.S. officials the idea of a joint U.S.-Russian operation against Muslims in Central Asia or the Caucasus. This accords with Mr. Clinton's declining support to Central Asian leaders who want help against radical Muslims. Instead, he is driving them back into Mr. Putin's hands.

Unfortunately, George W. Bush has spoken about Russia as if he would behave in the same enabling fashion as Mr. Clinton. Al Gore, of course, has shaped and supported Mr. Clinton's policy for eight years. The time has come, however, to adopt a new approach toward Russia.

We do not need nuclear test explosions now, and we do not want others conducting them. We have a wealth of knowledge gained from more than a thousand tests. Our nuclear arsenal is safe, reliable and effective.","After the Senate voted against the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in October 1999, I was asked to
recommend steps to build bipartisan support for U.S. ratification. After nearly a year as a special adviser to the
president and the secretary of state, I am impressed by how much common ground can be found through quiet,
nonpartisan discussions. There is broad bipartisan agreement that nuclear proliferation ranks among the gravest
threats to national security.
The test ban treaty is no panacea for this problem, but I believe it can contribute to a comprehensive solution.
Banning nuclear explosions places significant technical constraints on nuclear weapon development, especially of
advanced designs that are more efficient and easier to deliver. The test ban treaty is also an integral part of the
political bargain that the United States made in 1995 to gain permanent extension of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons requires a web of restraints. If one component is damaged, others will
be weakened. Our credibility, our leadership in any nonproliferation effort, and the long-term viability of the
non-proliferation treaty itself would be strengthened by our ratification of the test ban treaty, and weakened
without it.
As a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, it is my considered view that we should not reverse the policy
instituted in 1992 and resume testing new nuclear weapon designs. Given our overwhelming conventional
superiority, assigning a broader role to nuclear weapons would cause far more problems than it would solve.
My intensive review of the test ban treaty strengthened my earlier judgment that this treaty is compatible with
keeping a safe and reliable U.S. nuclear deterrent and is an essential part of an effective nonproliferation
strategy. Recommendations I have made would help answer legitimate questions about the treaty's
nonproliferation value, its verifiability, its impact on the U.S. nuclear deterrent and its indefinite duration. None of
these recommendations requires renegotiating the treaty; all would improve our position under it. Most should
have broad bipartisan support.
In any event, the recommendations can and should be implemented without delay simply because they are
important for our national security in their own right. They are:
* That our government adopt a more integrated approach to nonproliferation, appoint a deputy national security
adviser for nonproliferation to oversee it, and work more closely with like-minded countries.
* That the United States strengthen its capability to detect and deter nuclear testing, as well as its ability to
monitor the many steps proliferators must take before they can test a nuclear device.
* That we make improvements to the U.S. Stockpile Stewardship Program to minimize any potential risks to the
long-term reliability or safety of our nuclear deterrent.
Implementing these three recommendations would have the added benefit of mitigating most concerns that have
been voiced about the test ban treaty.
I urge the new administration and the Senate to reexamine the test ban treaty in light of the contributions it can
make to strengthened U.S. leadership of a comprehensive nonproliferation strategy. We do not need nuclear test

explosions now, and we do not want others conducting them. We have a wealth of knowledge gained from more
than a thousand tests. Our nuclear arsenal is safe, reliable and effective.
The president-elect has endorsed continuing the U.S. nuclear testing moratorium. Other countries, however, are
more likely to continue their own voluntary test moratoriums if they are considered steps toward a verifiable,
legally binding ban, not end-points in themselves.
Russia has ratified the test ban treaty, along with 68 other countries. China, which has signed but not yet ratified,
as well as India and Pakistan, which have made provisional promises to sign and ratify, are watching to see what
the next administration will do.
In response to concerns about the test ban treaty's indefinite duration, I am recommending that the Senate and
the executive branch conduct a joint review of the treaty's overall impact on national security 10 years after
ratification. If serious concerns cannot be resolved, the president would exercise our right to withdraw.
High-level reconsideration of the test ban treaty and a sustained interagency effort to work toward ratification
would also increase congressional support for other important aspects of U.S. defense policy. For example, a
bipartisan commitment to a stronger stockpile stewardship program is more likely if the program remains closely
linked to U.S. support for the test ban treaty.
Progress on ratification is also important for U.S. leadership of global nonproliferation efforts. All our NATO allies
and most of our other security partners have ratified the test ban treaty. They are likely to cooperate more closely
with us on other nonproliferation initiatives -- such as tougher safeguards on civilian nuclear programs and tighter
controls over exports related to weapons of mass destruction -- if we don't close the door on a nonproliferation
tool that they value highly.
One thing is clear: A successful U.S. nonproliferation strategy must be based on a broad international consensus.
We cannot manage this problem on our own. And that means we must find a way to move forward with the test
ban treaty.

"McFarlane, Robert",,0,2001-04-10,1,0,0,WaPO,Marine Corps,,,M,Fueling a Revival,Russia is making clear its intention once more to become a superpower -- this time relying heavily on the power inherent in controlling vast energy resources….all of these matters are currently under review by the new administration.  The resultant global energy policy cannot come a moment too soon. ,"Russia is the wealthiest country in the world in terms of natural resources. It has always been clear that if ever
Russia were able to develop and exploit its oil, gas and precious metals in a sensible fashion it could become an
economic superpower of virtually unlimited potential. Today it is impressive to see how quickly following its
ideological collapse in the Cold War and more recent economic implosion in the summer of '98, Russia has begun
once more to exercise the power inherent in its natural wealth.
Two examples underscore the point. Beginning last fall during visits to Brussels and other European capitals,
President Vladimir Putin focused on Russia's readiness to ensure a continued supply of natural gas to Western
Europe as North Sea reserves decline -- a dependency that could place significant political leverage in Russia's
hands.
In the same vein, Russia has concluded an agreement with Turkey to lay a pipeline under the Black Sea to deliver
19 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually -- more than half Turkey's requirements. Here again, Russia's role as
leading supplier of primary energy to Turkey will substantially enhance its influence in Ankara.
Closer to home, Russia has demonstrated a more ""market-oriented' management of its resources. For example in
Georgia and Ukraine, it has orchestrated the cutoff of gas in the dead of winter, ostensibly over nonpayment of bills
-- a problem that hadn't seemed to bother Russia for the previous 70 years. In Central Asia, Russia has offered
assistance to five states to help them withstand the threat of Islamic fundamentalism, which is just a step away in
Afghanistan. It ought not go unnoticed that were these states to rejoin a new Soviet Union, they would bring with
them the oil and gas resources of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, now estimated as nearly equivalent to those of
Saudi Arabia.
Next door in Iran, Russia has reneged on its commitment to the Clinton administration to cease military sales to the
government and has continued its nuclear assistance program to Iran. In short, Russia under Vladimir Putin is on
the move to use the demand for its natural resources to advance its political interests.
I sketch these scenarios involving European and Turkish vulnerability, and the potential for Russia to recapture
control over the huge central Asian oil and gas reserves not so much because I believe they are inevitable -- they
are not -- but rather to underscore the importance of our moving to deal with these matters. For example, we could
encourage the participation of U.S. oil and gas developers in the exploration and production of Russian oil and gas -
- a win-win proposition as Russia benefits from U.S. investment and state-of-the-art technology to accelerate the

Fueling a Revival
development of its fields, and we gain a measure of control over the pace and terms of developing Russia's
resources.
In parallel, we could focus intensively on developing our relations with the central Asian states, to include a
substantial business presence, and by planting the American flag, to nurture the independence of these states and
their ability to resist being absorbed into a revived Soviet orbit. In the process we could lay a foundation for offering
Western Europe and Turkey a second source of oil and gas -- from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan across the
Caspian Sea to Baku and thence westward to Turkey and Europe, and southward through Iran -- yes, Iran -- to the
Persian Gulf and the Asian market.
As for our relations with Iran, clearly our policy of seeking to isolate that country through economic sanctions hasn't
worked to achieve any of the goals for which the sanctions were put in place. It hasn't inhibited support by Iran's
radical clerics for terrorist groups, and it hasn't inhibited Iran's nuclear program, or engendered Iranian support for
the Middle East peace process.
In fact, one could argue that sanctions have contributed in different ways to prolonging these adversarial positions
more than to impeding them. Sanctions have achieved some things, but they are all contrary to American security
interests. First, they have drawn Russia and Iran together into a quasi-economic alliance. Second, they have
foreclosed U.S. access to Iran's substantial energy resources while forfeiting that access to European and
Japanese companies. Third, they have made it more difficult for the relatively pragmatic government of President
Mohammad Khatami to engage with us. Clearly a review of our policies toward Iran is long overdue.
Russia is making clear its intention once more to become a superpower -- this time relying heavily on the power
inherent in controlling vast energy resources, offering them to potential clients in Western Europe and in Turkey and
gaining political leverage in doing so.
All of these matters are currently under review by the new administration. The resultant global energy policy cannot
come a moment too soon.

"Odom, William",1988,1,2001-06-20,1,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Macedonian Crisis Shows Need for NATO Expansion,"Equal audacity and speed is needed to finish making Europe whole and free with NATO enlargement. If the President wants to match his father's legacy, he can. ","For more than a decade now, the U.S. has been trailing behind the spread of war in the Balkans. First in Bosnia, then in Kosovo, and now in Macedonia, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been ""a day late and a dollar short,"" as the old saying goes. It is time to get ahead, to make events instead of being led by them, and a larger Balkans security framework is essential to that end.

This framework's cornerstone has to be the inclusion in NATO, not just of the Baltic states (as President Bush pledged on his European trip), but also of Romania and Bulgaria. That step, more than any other, will help Western leaders see the bigger regional picture and devise ways to turn the area from civil war and rampant crime to civil order and profitable business.

Why have American leaders and the public consistently been late to respond to the spreading fire of civil strife in the Balkans? In large part because they simply do not recognize all the dry tinder spread throughout the region that troublemakers easily ignite.

We learned a lot about that tinder in Bosnia -- after it was ignited. We chose not to see what was long obvious -- that Kosovo would erupt in bloodletting unless NATO forces arrived ahead of the violence. Actually, the early placement of a U.S. battalion in Macedonia kept the peace there until recently, but with the unleashing of the Kosovo Liberation Army cadres by the NATO occupation of Kosovo, it proved to be a presence too small to prevent rebel activities spreading into Macedonia. All of this was foreseeable.

Why not look ahead? Where does the tinder trail lead next, waiting for a spark to ignite it? It does not stop in Macedonia. It connects Albania, but not by Tirana's fantasies of a ""Greater Albania,"" but by family clans with links in Macedonia, Kosovo and northern Albania. They are beyond the control of the weak Albanian government and very willing to supply guns and soldiers for trouble-making in Macedonia. Their sources of money and means reach into Western Europe, the U.S. and the Middle East.

The tinder trail also leads into Bulgaria. In the years between World War I and II, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, a terrorist group, strove to bring most of Slavic Macedonia into Bulgaria, insisting that the Macedonians are really Bulgarians. If Macedonia adopted a federal system to accommodate the Albanian minority, that could reawaken those old aspirations for Bulgarian annexation of the Slavic component. Such events may now seem unthinkable, but they can easily become very thinkable indeed.

In Romania, it may also seem unthinkable that strife could reemerge in Transylvania, where a large Hungarian minority lives with a history of poor relations with its Romanian neighbors. Why has this province not erupted like Kosovo? The answer is simple: Romania wants to join NATO.

To woo NATO's favor, the government signed a treaty with Hungary, promising to protect the rights of the Transylvanian Hungarians. It also settled its border disputes with Ukraine and rejected Russian offers to return Moldova to Romania in exchange for opposing the first round of NATO enlargement. What can we expect if Romania concludes that it has few or no prospects for NATO membership?

As NATO forces prepared to enter Kosovo, Russia demanded Romanian and Bulgarian air passage rights for military transports loaded with airborne troops to fly to Pristina. Both countries refused. They saved the Clinton administration from the embarrassment of seeing Russian troops occupy the border area around Mitrovica, placed to make endless mischief in Kosovo. Bulgaria and Romania stood up to Moscow because they want to join NATO.

Russian troops, however, are only one small transit problem. Both countries have large flows of drug traffic, illegal migration, female slave trade, and other forms of crime coming from the southern parts of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East. Yet neither country is effective at blocking them from moving on to Western Europe. Organized criminal groups are increasingly able to muscle aside law-enforcement officials to keep their transit lines open.

These domestic weaknesses in Romania and Bulgaria will be cited as reasons not to allow either country to join NATO. I confess to accepting this argument during the first round of NATO enlargement, but I do not today. The ""membership action plans"" NATO requires for preparation for membership are forcing both governments to make reforms they otherwise would not, or probably could not, without such pressure. After they are admitted, the pressure should be greatly increased. To deny them admittance is to make reforms all but impossible.

Even if they cannot now meet the criteria set for new members, that should not rule out giving them early assurances that they will soon be accepted, if not in 2002, then a year or two thereafter. Too much is at stake; too many crises can be preempted; and too much is to be gained by lowering the criteria. If today's criteria had been used in 1949, many of the alliance's initial members would have been excluded, left alone to face the disorder in Europe at the time.

Because President Bush's father was bold and swift in 1990, against a lot of advice from our European allies, he was able to reunite Germany within NATO, something no one dreamed possible. Imagine Europe today if he had not. Equal audacity and speed is needed to finish making Europe whole and free with NATO enlargement. If the president wants to match his father's legacy, he can.

"Sinnreich, Richard",,1,2001-07-05,1,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Up-or-Out: It's No Be-All and End-All,"All this suggests that, by itself, ending up-or-out won't solve -- indeed, could magnify -- the military's manpower challenge. As Jeremiah himself notes, what really is required is a comprehensive military human resources strategy that attacks the entire personnel management problem, not just a piece of it.","While Washington nervously awaits the Bush administration's promised recasting of America's military strategy,
one of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's study committees has published a set of personnel-related
proposals that ultimately could have more impact on the military than any of its futuristic weapon programs.
At a recent Pentagon news conference, retired Navy admiral David Jeremiah, former vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, briefed reporters on a wide range of morale and quality-of-life proposals. Among them is
amendment of the military's longstanding practice of forcing out personnel who fail to be promoted within a
specific length of service -- in the jargon, ""up-or-out.""
This is not the first time ""up-or-out"" has earned criticism since its adoption by the Navy in the last century. Applied
to officers of all services in 1947 and to enlisted personnel after the Vietnam War, ""up-or-out"" long has been a
favorite target of military personnel management studies. In 1976, for example, a Defense Manpower
Commission report concluded that the practice ""has created morale problems . . . caused personnel turbulence
and general hardship [and is] failure oriented.""
Nevertheless, Congress and the military services have been loath to abandon ""up-or-out"" altogether. Instead,
successive legislative and regulatory changes in military personnel management have merely tweaked the
system.
It isn't hard to understand why. ""Up-or-out"" was adopted in the first place to correct military promotion and
retention practices that stultified institutional reform, rewarded seniority above talent, retained superannuated
officers long past their primes and routinely blocked promotion of younger successors.
George C. Marshall, for example, spent 10 years as a captain after World War I, and Dwight D. Eisenhower
remained a major for nearly 20 years before World War II broke the peacetime promotion logjam. Other officers
confronted with the prospect of years in underpaid junior grades simply abandoned the military in disgust, and
more might have done so but for the Great Depression.
""Up-or-out"" has corrected that problem, but at a price. For one thing, by making retention contingent on
promotion, up-or-out tends to generate individual careerist incentives at odds with the organizational commitment
central to effective military performance. It also tends to increase assignment volatility, a growing problem in an
era of reduced force structure and increased operational tempo.
Most of all, however, up-or-out is out of step with a military that increasingly competes with civilian industry for
highly trained specialists from pilots to programmers. Speaking to that at his briefing, Jeremiah noted: ""Most of
the people we send out of the military, in a corporation are just at the point where they're really producing. . . . It
doesn't make any sense.""
Of course he's right, and the problem is only aggravated by a retirement system that, unlike its civilian
counterparts, provides no vesting for those leaving earlier than 20 years. That makes it much harder to recruit and
retain younger people unwilling to commit at an early age to a full career.
Meanwhile, with few exceptions, the military is closed to mid-career entry. While understandable for combat
specialists such as tankers and submariners, that bar also prevents the military from competing in the
marketplace for experienced talent in more generic fields, from computer science to law enforcement.",6,ServiceCulture,,,,,,,66,107,2001,0.786680931,0.66312,29.3065918,32.3858915
"Clark, Wesley",2000,1,2001-08-17,1,0,1,NYT,Army,,,M,A Month in Macedonia Will Not Be Enough,"If NATO is serious about making democracy work in this fractious corner of Europe, then Western forces need to enter as soon as possible, engage as broadly as possible and stay as long as necessary to restore peace. To do otherwise is to reawaken the ghosts of the 1990's that we have done so much to bury.","The North Atlantic Treaty Organization expects to send some 3,500 troops to Macedonia in the next few weeks to
collect rebel weapons. This decision, which is scheduled to be made today, is meant to signal that NATO is
serious about its commitment to the region.
But sending these troops with such a restricted mandate belies NATO's commitment. A mission so limited in
scope and time risks failure in the decade-long effort to bring peace, stability and multi-ethnic democracy to the
Balkans.
If we have learned but one thing in the tragic breakup of the old Yugoslavia, it is the need to act early and robustly
in a crisis. The United States, as the leading power in NATO, should know this best of all. In 1991 America stood
by as the United Nations and many European nations tried unsuccessfully to cope with devastating war in the
Balkans. Some 200,000 casualties and 2 million people made homeless, capped with the gruesome massacre of
more than 5,000 Muslims at Srebrenica, finally pushed the United States and NATO into action. In 1995, when
the United States pledged to commit American troops to enforce peace alongside European allies, we brought the
hostilities to an end.
In 1999, as ethnic cleansing grew in Kosovo, NATO backed up unsuccessful diplomacy with Operation Allied
Force, which reversed the Serb violence and ultimately led to Slobodan Milosevic's being removed from power
and delivered to The Hague in June for prosecution.
But NATO's pallid response to the fighting that began in Macedonia early this year puts all previous efforts at risk.
In February the Albanian guerrillas, based in Kosovo, had at most a few hundred fighters and supporters, and
their weapons were limited to rifles and a few machine guns.
Macedonian casualties were few, and it was easy to underestimate the threat that the fighting might expand.
NATO forces from Kosovo, including roughly 3,000 support troops already in Macedonia, could have quickly
reinforced the Macedonian police and military in ending the violence. However, NATO did not authorize action in
Macedonia; it just condemned the violence.
When the unprepared Macedonian military responded by firing artillery and rockets against villages, local
Albanians quickly joined the ranks of fighters. Some in the Macedonian military distributed weapons to Slavic
Macedonians, and the familiar pattern of Balkan warfare emerged -- fleeing refugees, gangs of thugs threatening
other ethnic groups, charges of torture and murder.
NATO then decided to seek a cease-fire and a political agreement before authorizing military intervention. For
weeks the political debate in Macedonia has raged while the fighting has spread and the extremists have
strengthened their positions. Swaths of northern Macedonia are now under virtual rebel control.
Now that an agreement to redress Albanian grievances has been achieved, along with a cease-fire, a limited
NATO deployment is commencing. But the price has been high: more than 150,000 people have been displaced
from their homes, 100 have died and property has been severely damaged. And the agreement notwithstanding,
the Albanian and Slav political leaders have been pushed to the extremes; the center has grievously weakened.
No one knows whether the cease-fire will hold. A decade of bitter ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia
suggests it will not. Once violence escalates and neighbor fights neighbor, trust, security and cooperation are
shattered.
Page 46 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Most likely, Albanian weapons will be hidden and Slav paramilitaries organized while both sides quibble and
dispute the implementation of the agreement. Cynicism will undercut lofty rhetoric. Bitterness will undermine
moderate leaders. The smallest incident may be cited as proof of the other side's insincerity.
In such an environment, will NATO's plan be sufficient? Will NATO do no more than collect weapons? And if, at
the end of the 30-day period for this collection, the cease-fire is shaky and ethnic tensions are rising, can troops
simply depart?
The consequences of failure are increasingly clear. If this agreement does not hold, Macedonia is likely to split
apart. And this in turn is likely to rejuvenate old aims of establishing ethnically pure states and to the ethnic
cleansing that goes along with them. In the peculiar logic of the region, a fractured Macedonia increases the
likelihood of a partitioned Kosovo, which in turn strengthens those who seek to unite Serbia with Republika
Srpska, the Serbian half of Bosnia.
If NATO is serious about making democracy work in this fractious corner of Europe, then Western forces need to
enter as soon as possible, engage as broadly as possible and stay as long as necessary to restore peace. To do
otherwise is to reawaken the ghosts of the 1990's that we have done so much to bury.

concluded that the most serious threat to this nation is the likelihood that Americans would die on their own soil --
from a terrorist attack -- likely in large numbers. They also concluded and testified before Congress that it may,
sadly, take a disaster to awaken the country to the fact that the security environment has changed, and that the
way we must respond to it must change as well. Now the disaster has struck, and while we may feel at the
moment as though we are in a trance, we are, in fact, awakening.
The commission's mandate was to examine the suitability of the present governmental structure to deal with the
threats and opportunities of the 21st century. It concluded that major changes were needed: in structure and
processes of national security, in our intelligence methods, investments and priorities, in executive-legislative
coordination and more. But the commissioners understood something more important: that, as the final report
said, ""homeland security is not peripheral to U.S. national security strategy, but central to it."" Our commissioners
feared that mass-casualty attacks at home would ""jeopardize not only American lives, but U.S. foreign policy writ
large."" Such an event could ""undermine support for U.S. international leadership and for many of our personal
freedoms as well. Indeed, the abrupt undermining of U.S. power and prestige is the worst thing that could happen
to the structure of global peace in the next quarter century and nothing is more likely to produce it than
devastating attacks on American soil.""
We must not let that happen. While we now stand at what is certainly one of the saddest moments in American
history, it is also one of the most dangerous. For it has the potential of changing what we do and who we are.
These attacks must not lead us to abandon our principles, our national objectives or the leadership role that no
other nation can now serve. We must not do the terrorists' work for them.
For the moment we must continue exactly what we're doing: trying to save as many lives as possible and protect
the nation from further harm. But as the smoke clears and the dust settles, there will be a tendency on the part of
some to disengage. Others will call for striking out in revenge. And the pressure will be high to do so quickly,
perhaps before we can be certain just who the perpetrators were. Both responses would be disastrous. The world
will not function as it now does without engagement of the United States, nor can we function without
engagement with others. Our aim must be to identify with certainty the source of these attacks and all those who
assisted them and then to respond with measured and deadly resolve. Not to respond would be unthinkable: It
would diminish and demean American leadership and would surely invite further attacks. But to react excessively
or inaccurately would put us on the same moral footing as the cowards who perpetrated yesterday's attack.
This country must continue to function as we did before, to the full measure of our domestic and foreign activities.
Our president must convey to the American people that there is an answer to this kind of plague and that we will
certainly find and apply it. It incorporates enhanced diplomacy and refined military tools for the requirements of
21st century security. It will take time, but we will prevail.
Americans must now accept the sober realization that while some people hate us for what we do, others hate us
for who we are. This nation symbolizes freedom, strength, tolerance and democratic principles dedicated to both
liberty and peace. To the tyrants, the despots, the closed societies, there are no alterations to our policies, no
gestures we can make, no words we can say that will convince those determined to continue their hate. But for
much of the rest of the world, our engagement and influence cannot be replaced. In short, we must stay the
course of American involvement, for the right reasons, throughout the world.

Those who carried out yesterday's attacks believe they are at war with us. We have no choice now but to treat
those threats accordingly and to address our serious national vulnerabilities.
The president has assigned the task of reviewing homeland security to the vice president. That review is to be
completed by October. Our first priority of national security strategy, and the one for which we are least prepared,
must be homeland security. The nation has much capability at the federal, state and local level, but it is ill
organized, unevenly trained and equipped and, most important, not led by a single individual vested with
responsibility, authority or resources. Now that we're awake, these shortfalls can be overcome quickly.

"McFarlane, Robert",,0,2001-09-12,1,0,1,WaPO,Marine Corps,,,M,Get Them Where They Live,We have more than ample reason to take on terrorism in Afghanistan. A systemic approach is needed. The means of such an approach are at hand. We must get started. ,"In the days ahead, as grief and rage evolve toward revenge and preventing a recurrence, we will all be tested. We -- all of us, not just the government -- have known for years that this could happen someday. Worse, we even knew who would do it -- Osama bin Laden or one of two or three other cells with the means to conceive and carry out such an attack. In the coming days and months as our policy postmortem unfolds, we will be forced to acknowledge a cruel irony -- our democracy invites this kind of thing. Our principled defense of individual freedom and our reluctance to intervene in the affairs of states harboring terrorists makes us an easy target.

Our anguish will be worsened when we learn that -- to its great credit -- the FBI has prevented literally hundreds of similar attempts to explode a bomb or hijack an airliner. But as yesterday's attack makes clear, it is impossible to catch them all. Our borders cannot be closed to a determined terrorist; if we want to deal with terrorism, we must go to the source. And therein lies our dilemma. Civilized democracies -- with the exception of Israel -- are reluctant to carry their own self-defense to the point of holding other sovereign states accountable for harboring terrorists. What more egregious example could there be than Afghanistan's providing safe haven for Osama bin Laden?

For years we have known of bin Laden's headquarters for training and launching terrorists from Afghanistan. And for years we have known that the only ways to prevent attacks like Tuesday's were either to persuade the Afghan or Pakistani governments to capture him or to capture him ourselves. During the past five years it has become clear that the extremist Taliban would do nothing to inhibit bin Laden's activities. And it is also clear that bin Laden will not be deterred by the remote use of force -- cruise missiles and the like. Unlike Moammar Gaddafi, bin Laden is not a bully who may be cowed by overwhelming force but rather a zealot, a fanatic devoted with maniacal zeal to doing all that he can to rid his region of Western influence. He has no fear of violence against himself.

In the days ahead, as we analyze how to go after bin Laden and other terrorist cells, certain considerations stand out. First, in addition to the Taliban, the government of Pakistan must be held accountable for what has happened. For almost two years Gen. Pervez Musharraf has maintained the pretense that Pakistan has no influence on the Taliban -- an outrageous position on its face. Even setting aside for a moment the huge military support provided over the years to the Taliban by Pakistan's Inter-Service-Intelligence agency, bear in mind that Afghanistan is land-locked. Pakistan is the principal airhead and land route through which people and commodities come and go into Afghanistan. Pakistan is vital to the survival of the Taliban and to its continued provision of safe haven to bin Laden. It is time for Pakistan to lead, follow or get out of the way.

Within Afghanistan also exists a basis for hope that the Taliban - - and ultimately bin Laden -- can be ousted. It lies in the widespread disaffection -- even contempt -- for the Taliban that exists at the grass roots throughout Afghanistan, including among commanders who comprise as much as one-third of the Taliban's own forces. Recall that five years ago, the appeal of the Taliban among Afghans was its commitment to take back the country from the warlords who had co-opted the hard-won victory of the Mujaheddin against the Soviet Union, only to install their own authoritarian model. Indeed the Taliban formed most of its original effective fighting strength on the backs of former Mujaheddin commanders who rallied to them believing that they could thereby reclaim their original victory. Now, five years later, these commanders are fed up with the outrageous policies and practices of the Taliban and ready -- subject to receiving encouragement from us -- to unravel the Taliban, to call for a national assembly, to form a provisional government and over time to take back their country from unwanted foreign influence, including, most importantly, that of bin Laden. It is true, however, that they cannot do it alone. They need us to lean hard on Pakistan to cease and desist in its support for the Taliban, and indeed to support these fighters. Ultimately it may also require American military support. And we should be ready to provide it in overwhelming degree.

If ever our government was hesitant to acknowledge that we have important interests wrapped up in far-off Afghanistan, certainly Tuesday's events must dispel them. We have more than ample reason to take on terrorism in Afghanistan. A systemic approach is needed. The means of such an approach are at hand. We must get started.

"McFarlane, Robert",,0,2001-11-02,1,0,1,WSJ,Marine Corps,,,M,The Tragedy of Abdul Haq,TBD,"More than a year ago it became clear to any casual reader of news from Afghanistan that there was growing opposition to the Taliban. The resistance came not just from the Northern Alliance, but from villagers and fighters throughout the country, especially in southern Pashtun areas. This ought to have been a clear signal that the Taliban were vulnerable, and that the opposition could play a critical role in bringing them down. It should have led the CIA to engage with grass-roots opposition, to support and nurture people like Abdul Haq, a commander who last week was caught and executed by the Taliban.

Unfortunately no such effort was made. And therein lies a scandalous, tragic story of bureaucratic incompetence with profound implications for our national security in the years ahead. Let me go back to the beginning.

At about this time last year, I was approached by Joseph Ritchie, a successful Chicago businessman and friend who had spent much of his childhood in Afghanistan. He shared my sense of the potential for Afghans to take back their country from the Taliban, and asked my advice as to how they ought to go about it. I felt that the organizing and support of any effort to bring down the Taliban was beyond the means of, and inappropriate for, private sponsors. It was a role for governments, and I offered to help him bring the concept to the attention of appropriate officials in Washington.

Together we first reconnected with one of the most successful commanders from the struggle to force the Soviet Union from Afghanistan in the 1980s, Abdul Haq. I had first met Haq while serving as President Reagan's national security adviser in 1984. When he came to the White House, Haq had already established a reputation as a courageous combat leader and brilliant tactician. President Reagan and later Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher were equally impressed.

Through our talks over the next several months, culminating in February of this year, I became convinced that with fairly modest support Haq and 50 to 60 of his fellow commanders had the forces, and the necessary skill and determination, to take on the Taliban. I believed, however, that parallel to his military campaign, there needed to be a political framework -- a process to form a post-Taliban government -- that would bring civil order back to the country and manage its reconstruction. Abdul Haq and Joe Ritchie agreed and devoted several months to enlisting the former king of Afghanistan, Zahir Shah, to serve as the catalyst and moral foundation of this process.

We received attentive hearings and encouragement at the departments of State and Defense, as well as the White House. In each case, however, we were told that the CIA had responsibility for this mission. Unfortunately, the CIA made it clear that it was reluctant to take on the assignment.

In a series of meetings, we urged that CIA officials begin planning with proven commanders with well-documented track records. They responded with flimsy criticism of the commanders, all of it based on hearsay. Disclaiming any personal stake in our preferred nominees, we then asked only that they go into the field and do their own due diligence, and especially talk to the dozens of commanders who were disposed to help. To this we received only dismissive comments and indifference. In one astonishing exchange we were told, to paraphrase, ""We don't yet have our marching orders concerning U.S. policy; it may be that we will end up dealing with the Taliban."" Such an attitude obviously turns the mission of intelligence gathering -- to inform policy makers -- on its head.

Faced with this persistent recalcitrance, Haq -- who had been reluctant to seek U.S. help and never expected to get it -- decided in mid-August to go ahead and launch operations in Afghanistan. He returned to Peshawar, Pakistan, to make final preparations. After six weeks' work coordinating with other commanders, and a short trip to Rome to coordinate with the king, on Oct. 21 he re-entered Afghanistan and headed for Jalalabad. He knew that he had been under surveillance by Taliban operatives in Peshawar and was very vulnerable, but believed he could evade them and join up with his colleagues.

Unfortunately, due to his popularity, he was recognized -- and compromised -- as he transited villages along his way. After four days, while proceeding with his party up a narrow road in the mountains near Jalalabad, he was ambushed. While under attack his nephew, a member of the group, called Joe Ritchie's brother, James, in Peshawar and asked, ""Can you do something?"" James called me, and I, in turn, called the CIA operations center. An unmanned surveillance aircraft was vectored to the battle area. It successfully attacked a convoy at some distance from the ambush, but by then, almost five hours later, Haq had already been captured. The next day the Taliban executed him.

The tragedy here is not just the loss of a man of courage and excellence to whom the U.S. owed a great deal, but the dysfunction within the CIA that his loss underscores. It was implausible that this 11th-hour request for help would have succeeded. The calamity is the CIA's failure to engage with him -- or with any of the dozens of other capable Afghan commanders -- a year earlier and to put in place the coordination that could have avoided his loss. Such planning would also have put us in a position today to work with Haq's fellow Pashtun commanders.

Abdul Haq is gone. Fortunately, his brothers-in-arms remain committed to toppling the Taliban. They constitute a capable alternative to a large deployment of U.S. forces if we will devote the appropriate attention and planning in the days ahead. These Pashtun field commanders are driven to take back their country not for us -- since we abandoned them after the Soviets withdrew, they have little confidence or respect for us -- but for themselves and their countrymen. It is undeniably in our interest that these fighters be given a chance -- and any support they might request -- to do this job.

Their effort would benefit enormously from local intelligence and material support. Moreover, the undoing of the Taliban by Afghans would remove any claim of martyrdom from Osama bin Laden, as well as reduce the risk of losing our Muslim coalition partners. The alternative is for much larger U.S. forces to do the job. They would surely succeed, but at a much larger cost in lives.

The best bet is cooperation. The U.S. military is superbly prepared to engage in this kind of war. For 20 years we have been perfecting a solid capability for rapid reaction, small unit raids in remote areas, and special operations behind enemy lines. The Joint Special Operations Command is a magnificent fighting organization comprised of the best-trained, combat-ready troops available from the Army, Navy and Air Force. They will surely dominate every battlefield on which they are deployed.

As in all combat operations, however, success begins with intelligence; you need to know as much as you can about the enemy. Even the best force in the world will fail without solid intelligence. The CIA cannot provide it; it has utterly failed to do its job. But the military can. By working together, the Pashtun commanders and our special operations forces can win in Afghanistan.

For 25 years national-security professionals have lamented the decline of the CIA, especially its clandestine service. The Church and Pike committees destroyed it in the mid-1970s and no meaningful rebuilding has occurred. Sadly, we must accept that in this war, the CIA will be on the sidelines. But surely the attack of Sept. 11 removes any illusion that we can continue to ignore our void in human intelligence. The overhaul of the CIA requires focused presidential direction. But while that long-term process gets underway, we should focus on helping the Afghans to win the war in their country -- and this time helping them rebuild when the fighting is over.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,66,107,2001,0.786680931,0.66312,29.3065918,32.3858915

The war on terror, more than any 20th century conflict, requires strong allies for success. We have the mechanism at hand in NATO.","For nearly five months the United States has been at war. Americans have been told to consider this a global conflict, and much has been made of our need for allies and coalition partners. But there has been scant mention of NATO, our most important alliance. Are we missing a bet here?

This weekend will see defense ministers, diplomats, generals and strategists from across the world gathering in Munich for the annual Wehrkunde Conference. Begun during the Cold War to strengthen NATO's common resolve, it has now broadened to include participants from Russia, India, Pakistan and China, as well as many other countries. Much of the talk will be about the war on terror. But NATO remains at the core of the discussion, its resolve and future at issue -- questions underscored by NATO's obvious absence from the ongoing war effort.

Our NATO allies, more than any other nations, share America's values, help bear the burdens of our security needs and can contribute enormous heft to our diplomatic efforts. And the administration is quite right about the need for allies in the war on terrorism. Our European allies have responded, contributing political legitimacy, intelligence, law enforcement at home and forces abroad. Many NATO members have made a huge leap, engaging with peacekeeping and patrol assets in the U.S. Afghanistan campaign.

The American-led response to the events of Sept. 11 has been remarkably successful thus far, despite the frustrating search for Osama bin Laden. But there are deeper problems ahead: helping provide stability to Afghanistan; taking down al Qaeda in dozens of other countries; confronting the highly divisive issue of Iraq and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Longer term, the United States and its allies will have to deal with the failed states and other conditions that have spawned terrorism and fed its growth.

Why hasn't NATO been integral to this effort? Some have claimed that NATO can't fight a modern war, and cite the Kosovo campaign as evidence, saying ""no war by committee."" Others suggest that the European militaries have fundamentally nothing to offer the United States, and speak of intelligence leaks and obsolescent, incapable forces.

But wait a minute -- the Kosovo campaign was a success! It not only stopped the fighting and returned the refugees, it also enabled the international community to bring to justice the man most responsible for a decade of strife and destruction in the Balkans. The machinery of NATO served as a powerful ""consensus engine"" that enabled us to do what no single nation, not even the United States, could have done alone. The problems in the campaign were less a function of war by committee than a result of divisions within the U.S. government. And even then, NATO brought an entire family of 50- odd nations with us, ultimately leveraging our U.S.-led military efforts with so much political ""throw-weight"" that we succeeded decisively. The real lesson of Kosovo is the importance of allies and the political clout they bring.

Of course NATO has military problems. But why not fix them? Help NATO create a military-political decision-making architecture that can cope more easily with the stresses of target development and operational planning in modern warfare, that can handle sensitive information and that can field and command the kinds of high-tech elite forces that will win the campaigns of the 21st century. Full and active participation in our campaigns under the aegis of NATO will spur European military transformation more effectively than any number of studies, committees or harangues. At the same time, build on our common values to harvest the commitment of our closest allies in addressing the threat of al Qaeda wherever it may be, in healing the immediate post-operation trauma of failed states exploited by terrorist organizations and in providing the foundations for the development or restoration of governments effective in meeting their citizens' needs. The conflicts of the past decade have shown NATO's remarkable capacity to provide effective political direction in the difficulties and challenges of U.N.-mandated peace enforcement operations.

As U.S. leaders have repeatedly stressed, the war against terror cannot be won by bombs and bullets alone. Much of the action will take place out of sight, as information is gathered and exchanged. In many countries law enforcement agencies will be far more relevant than military forces. And these factors underscore the need for the strongest possible political and diplomatic cooperation. We vitally need NATO's ""consensus engine"" if we are to align domestic policies, share information closely and coordinate information collection, dissemination and enforcement actions across numerous nations.

If we proceed correctly, we can achieve a huge ancillary benefit: locking Europe into stability and peace. NATO's relevance in current operations is precisely what is required to forge the new relationships with Russia that are sought -- and, while we're at it, enlarge the alliance to bring in those states in eastern and central Europe that desperately seek NATO's protection from the strategic competitions and conflicts by which they have been repeatedly victimized. Some of the applicant nations are ready now for full participation in NATO; others need additional time to transform further their armed forces and align their policies to NATO procedures. But we should select them all now, stagger their admission dates and move ahead.

It's time to stop the sterile theoretical debate over NATO's future and put our full efforts to shaping the institution to deal with the urgent tasks at hand. The war on terror, more than any 20th century conflict, requires strong allies for success. We have the mechanism at hand in NATO.

"Owens, William and Weiss, Stanley",1996,1,2002-02-07,1,0,1,NYT,Navy,,,M,An Indefensible Military Budget,We and all Americans can agree with the president that we must spend whatever it costs to defend our nation. But no amount will be enough if we cannot spend our military dollars more efficiently.,"Congress cheered President Bush's pledge, in the State of the Union address, to spend ""whatever it costs to
defend our country."" But here's the secret. Mr. Bush already has most of the money he seeks. And absent real
reform, most of the additional money Congress ultimately approves -- the president has requested a quarter of a
trillion dollars more over the next five years -- will never reach our fighting men and women in the field.
That's because the real challenge is not spending more or less on defense. It's spending better.
Most, if not all, of the resources necessary to finance a 21st-century military are already available. But they're
wasted on mid-20th-century business practices. An astounding 70 percent of the defense budget is spent on
overhead and infrastructure (the bureaucratic ""tail""). Only 30 percent directly reaches our combat forces in the field
(the ""tooth""). No community would tolerate 7 out of every 10 police officers sitting at their desks pushing paper. The
nation should not tolerate such a ratio in the military.
Just how backward is the business of defense? It can take the military up to three weeks to replace parts --
something the private sector can do in two days. Of the Pentagon's $7 billion travel budget, $2 billion is spent on
administrative overhead.
These were just a few of the painful findings in a report issued last year by the Tail-to-Tooth Commission,
sponsored by Business Executives for National Security, an organization of business leaders that takes no position
on the size of the defense budget. The commission -- composed of corporate chief executives and former members
of Congress, defense secretaries and military leaders -- reviewed the findings of 18 major studies over the last 15
years on military expenditures and offered a step-by-step road map of how to reform the military so that it runs more
like a business.
For example, the military should be freed from nonmilitary missions like family housing; the private sector can do it
faster, better and cheaper. The Defense Department's byzantine acquisitions system and the archaic defense
accounting system, which can lose track of billions of taxpayer dollars, need to be updated, and excess military
bases that sap billions of defense dollars should be closed.
These vital reforms may now be forgotten in the fog of war. Throwing money at the Pentagon is certainly one way to
buy more defense, but in the long term it will not help improve our security. New money for the armed forces may
well become an excuse to maintain inefficient old habits.
Yet reform is more important than ever. President Bush came into office promising hard choices at the Pentagon.
Cutting the bloated bureaucracy and reinvesting the savings to transform the military was one of Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld's priorities. The day before Sept. 11, he declared that ""every dollar squandered on waste is one

denied to the war fighter."" He pledged to ""wage an all-out campaign to shift Pentagon's resources from bureaucracy
to the battlefield, from tail to the tooth.""
But real reform had already succumbed to a confluence of forces resistant to change -- vested interests,
organizational complexity and institutional inertia. The necessities of waging an all-out campaign against Al Qaeda
and the rush of new military spending now threaten to sink the reform boat.
The fact is that a more agile military needs an equally agile support team. We will never get the faster, lighter and
more lethal military we want -- no matter how much we spend -- if it's tied to a slow, heavy supply chain.
Streamlining would not only save billions; it would help build a leaner, more effective military to fight the war on
terrorism.
An easy-money approach avoids hard decisions and risks undermining the confidence of the American people just
as public trust in government has soared during this war.
We should not forget the public backlash against defense contractor scandals and $700 toilet seats during the
military buildup in the 1980's. Support for military budget increases will evaporate if the Pentagon devours billions in
new funding but fails to shed the fat.

"Sullivan, Gordon",1995,1,2002-05-16,1,0,1,WaPO,Army,,,M,Why We Need Crusader,"…Unless the Army is funded adequately to recapitalize existing systems and develop new weapons systems such as Crusader, with its proven technologies, is not certain we will be ready to win the nation's next war. ","The furor over the Army's Crusader mobile artillery system is reminiscent of an environment that existed more
than 50 years ago -- a time when the Army, as today, found itself competing for limited modernization dollars.
Among the seductive conclusions drawn in the aftermath of World War II was the notion that air power alone
could win future wars. The administration, in the late 1940s, put its architects of national military strategy to work
allocating the reduced defense budget to a ""silver bullet"" solution focused on strategic air and atomic weapons.
The resulting spending and planning priorities came at the expense of the Army and the surface Navy. The result
was that our Army, which had won major battles in World War II, from Normandy and Bastogne to Guadalcanal
and Okinawa, atrophied, and in 1950 found itself unprepared for an unexpected threat.
Many articles and books have been written about the harsh lessons the Army learned about unpreparedness
during those inter-war years. The inattention to modernization of the Army cost America dearly at the beginning of
the Korean War. The most blatant example was the Army's reliance on World War II-era armaments against
unanticipated superior Soviet tanks.
Those years before the Korean War showed how quickly our proud and much-vaunted Army could decline.
Without sustained funding for training, modernization, recapitalization and development of new technologies, an
Army quickly loses its edge. The price of such negligence is the blood of our sons and daughters.
Now, some 50 years later, we seem destined to write another chapter in unpreparedness. A new solution is taking
form and gaining enthusiastic support. The notion is that our future wars can be won without putting our military
men and women in harm's way. The ultimate ""silver bullet"" solution is now unmanned aerial vehicles with
laser-guided missiles. The Army, meanwhile, is beginning to show the frayed edges of atrophy as critical funding
for training, modernization, recapitalization and development is cut or abruptly shifted to new priorities and alluring
possibilities.
The best-known current example of this trend is the move to cancel one of the Army's most promising and
needed technologies, the Crusader Advanced Artillery System. The system is to be scrapped in favor of more
""transformational"" solutions, many of which are in fact not nearly as well developed or certain as Crusader. The
Army, which has a critical need for artillery, could find itself in the next conflict without adequate ground fire
support.
Far from being a Cold War system, Crusader was born in a time when we visualized a digitized Army that could
respond to today's enlightened enemy, an enemy who will attempt to overwhelm U.S. capabilities by conducting
rapid, multiple, nearly simultaneous operations across the battlefield.
Crusader is the most technologically advanced ground combat system ever developed. It was designed from the
ground up to fight in the digital, network-centered battlefield, to exploit information dominance. Its advanced
robotic operations and automated ammunition-handling systems allow the crew, enclosed in a protected cockpit,
to exploit information instead of straining muscles. The advanced composite hull, liquid-cooled gun and mobility of
the system elevate the effectiveness of our forces by 50 percent, with a corresponding reduction in resources.
Crusader covers an area 77 percent greater than current systems and has a 3 to 1 advantage in rate of fire.
One of the most important but less widely acknowledged lessons from World War II was the value of balanced
and complementary capabilities. Each of the services -- Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force -- has an

important role to play in achieving victory. But our victories come about only when joint commanders integrate the
competencies of each service into their operational plans. Such was the case during Desert Storm. We now find
ourselves, however, at the beginning of a new century facing the risk of having to relearn two painful lessons.
First, the armed forces emerged from Desert Storm victorious, having proven again that land forces were needed
as part of the military team. All the services came out of that war with experimental programs to help design the
weapons and organizations appropriate for the new strategic and tactical environment of the 21st century. Those
experiments have validated some technologies and concepts that are now in line to go into production.
Meanwhile, there are enthusiasts who believe in the promise of unproven concepts and technologies.
It would be inappropriate to abandon proven approaches that provide a bridge to the future while betting
everything on ideas that may take years to transform into capabilities that can deliver victory in some of the
challenging tactical environments our forces could face. That was precisely the approach our nation took in the
late 1940s.
Second, unless the Army is funded adequately to recapitalize existing systems and develop new weapons
systems such as Crusader, with its proven technologies, it is not certain we will be ready to win the nation's next
war. If that war takes us into an environment in which we do not have air supremacy, or air support is not
available because of competing priorities or weather, and no surrogate army can carry the ground war to the
enemy, then we cannot, or might not, win.
The lessons of the past should not burden us in inappropriate ways, but we all must accept the truth that in war,
things aren't simple. This country needs balanced and complementary capabilities to succeed",10,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,79,107,2001,0.786680931,0.66312,29.3065918,32.3858915
"Habiger, Eugene and Perry, William and Nunn, Sam",1998,1,2002-05-21,1,0,1,WaPO,Air Force,,,M,Still Missing: A Nuclear Strategy,"This week in Moscow, President Bush and President Vladimir Putin will sign a treaty reducing the number of U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear warheads over a 10-year time period. Reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons is vitally important and this is a strong step forward, but there is clearly more urgent work to be done.","This week in Moscow, President Bush and President Vladimir Putin will sign a treaty reducing the number of U.S.
and Russian long-range nuclear warheads over a 10-year time period. Reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons
is vitally important and this is a strong step forward, but there is clearly more urgent work to be done.
President Bush knows this. Well before Sept. 11, he cited the threats from nuclear material that cannot be
accounted for, from rogue nations, nuclear theft and accidental launch. He talked of the need to ""constrict the
supply of nuclear materials and the means to deliver them"" and the need to ""cut off the demand for nuclear
weapons by addressing the security concerns of those who renounce these weapons."" He said the United States
""should remove as many weapons as possible from high-alert, hair-trigger status.""
At his previous summit with Putin, Bush said, ""Our highest priority is to keep terrorists from acquiring weapons of
mass destruction.""
The administration's challenge is to put forward a coherent strategy for fulfilling the president's goals. So far it has
not.
The most likely, most immediate, most potentially devastating threat America faces is the threat of nuclear
terrorism. This puts us in a new nuclear arms race -- between terrorist efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and our
efforts to stop them. Acquiring weapons materials is the hardest step for the terrorists to take, and the easiest
step for us to stop. We and our allies should be taking every possible action to help make the tons of nuclear
materials in Russia and elsewhere secure from terrorist theft or purchase. But we're not. The budget for these
efforts remains essentially flat -- even though, at the current rate, it will take years to secure the remaining 60
percent of nuclear material in Russia that is not adequately protected. The administration needs immediately to
put forward new ideas, come up with new funding and recruit new partners to secure the raw materials of nuclear
terrorism in Russia and elsewhere.
On the question of nuclear weapons policy, some in the Bush administration are considering and openly
discussing steps that would take us in the opposite direction from the path pointed out by President Bush,
including expanding options for nuclear attacks, widening the number of targeted nations and developing new
nuclear weapons variants. While each of these ideas may have a plausible military rationale, their collective effect
is to suggest that the nation with the world's most powerful conventional forces is actually increasing its reliance
on nuclear forces. If other nations follow this example, they will increase their reliance on nuclear weapons and
undercut the cooperation we must have to defend the United States against nuclear terrorism. If our nation moves
in this direction, we will increase our ability to deal with unlikely threats -- and decrease our ability to deal with the
likely threats.
We addressed the Cold War's threats by confrontation with Moscow. There can be no realistic comprehensive
plan to defend America against today's threats that does not depend on cooperation with Moscow. It appears that
both President Bush and President Putin understand this, but their challenge is to get their own teams heading in
this direction. This week:
(1) Both Bush and Putin should pledge to ensure that nuclear, chemical and biological materials and weapons in
both countries are safe, secure and accounted for -- with reciprocal monitoring sufficient to assure each other and
the rest of the world that this is the case.
Page 54 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
(2) The United States and Russia should launch a global coalition against catastrophic terrorism by encouraging
and assisting all countries in adopting the same high standards to keep weapons of mass destruction and their
essential ingredients secure from terrorists. NATO should make this its top priority, and the new relationship with
Russia could be a big help.
(3) The two presidents should insist on an accurate accounting and adequate safeguards for tactical nuclear
weapons, including a baseline inventory of these weapons and reciprocal monitoring. These are the nuclear
weapons most attractive to terrorists -- even more valuable to them than fissile material, and much more portable
than strategic warheads; yet they are not covered by present treaties or agreements.
(4) Both presidents should order their military leaders, in joint consultation and collaboration, to devise operational
changes in the alert status of their nuclear forces that would reduce toward zero the risk of accidental launch or
miscalculation and increase the decision time before each president would be required to make the fateful
decision to launch. They should begin with an operational stand down of the weapons on both sides that are now
scheduled for reductions.
(5) Both presidents should pledge that the treaty they are signing will be supplemented by additional agreements
to ensure transparency, verifiability, irreversibility and stability. The goals of stability and irreversibility would be
substantially advanced by agreeing to dismantle nuclear weapons from each nation's stockpile.
This summit gives President Bush and our nation the opportunity to advance our top national security
imperatives. We are not assured of having this opportunity tomorrow. We must seize it today. There is much at
stake.

A bigger danger is Attorney General John Ashcroft returning powers to the FBI that were taken away in the 1970s because it had abused them. It couldn't catch spies when it had these powers before. Why should we believe that the FBI can use them to catch spies and terrorists today?","The high-profile arrest of the ""dirty bomb"" suspect may restore faith in our government's ability to catch terrorists or spies. In fact, however, this coup was apparently the result of our capture of a senior al Qaeda leader in Pakistan, not of home-grown police work. The fact remains that the FBI can never be effective at catching spies (i.e., ""counterintelligence,"" or ""CI,"" in government speak) or foreign terrorists. Two major reasons, one cultural, one structural, make it impossible to ""fix"" the FBI. The only solution is to take away its CI and counterterrorist responsibilities and put them in a brand new agency, a National Counterintelligence Service.

Over the past several weeks, the accumulating evidence of the FBI's miserable performance gives a wrong impression. It suggests that there were ""good old days"" at the FBI when it caught most spies. Not so. The past six decades are marked by repeated failures.

As more Soviet documents have become available since the end of the Cold War, we have learned that Soviet intelligence operatives ran through J. Edgar Hoover's FBI like water through a sieve. The Communist Party USA, it turns out, was a support organization for Soviet intelligence. Agent penetrations were numerous at very high levels of the U.S. government during and after World War II. Tipped off with the names of over 200 possible agents by Army codebreakers (who produced the Venona files), the FBI proved unable to collect sufficient evidence to arrest and prosecute them, with one exception, the Rosenbergs. High-profile cases like Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White, once contested, are no longer in doubt, but they were only a part of a larger network of Soviet spies that had penetrated several cabinet departments and the Manhattan Project.

Instead of indictments of dozens of Soviet agents, the FBI's activities in the 1940s and 1950s helped produce the McCarthy hearings. In the resulting media battle, the Communist Party used its covert influence to deflect the FBI and focus attention on Sen. Joseph McCarthy's unconscionable tactics.

This sorry record improved little in the following decades. Among the more notorious Soviet agents were William Kampiles in the 1970s, John Walker and Ronald Pelton in the 1980s, and Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen in the 1990s -- the latter two working, rather embarrassingly, in the CIA's and FBI's CI operations, respectively. Bungled cases, like Wen Ho Lee's at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, are far more numerous than the public is aware.

The two main causes for this record are systemic, and they are beyond the power of any FBI director to change.

The first involves skills and organizational culture. Law enforcement techniques that work against criminals seldom work against spies. Criminals normally have no large institutional support systems. They are not backed by foreign governments. They tend to be in a hurry, anxious to get rich, and, although there are exceptions, most are neither intelligent nor well educated. The FBI's main weapons, tapping telephones, using informers, and heavy-handed interrogations, can be effective against many criminals.

Such techniques do not work against spies, however, and more recently against terrorists. Spies and terrorists have different motivations and aims. They are backed by well-financed foreign organizations and states. Spies, in particular, tend to be educated and trained in spy craft. They know U.S. laws. They know U.S. bureaucracies. Foreign embassies provide them inviolable bases of support. Foreign governments will not extradite them at the FBI's request.

Law enforcement agencies thrive on media coverage. Counterespionage agencies can be destroyed by it. Law enforcement agencies are anxious to get a conviction and close a case. Spy-catchers must be patient, learn how spies operate, and only move to arrests as the final step in duping them. Counterintelligence officers must be able to empathize with alien cultures and ideologies. This is not necessary for G-men.

There is no way for the FBI to create and sustain both criminal-catching and spy-catching skills and cultures.

The second insurmountable hurdle for the FBI is structural. Today, no agency with CI operational responsibilities -- the FBI, the CIA, and the military -- can provide the president with a comprehensive CI picture. Each one has its narrow field of vision. The FBI and the CIA never have and never will share basic operational pictures. The military services probably would share, but have not been asked to do so. This leaves large gaps and distorted assessments of foreign espionage activities. Spies recognize those gaps and run through them with ease. The emerging picture of al Qaeda's operations in the U.S. shows how they did so, as well.

The only solution is the creation of a new National Counterintelligence Service dedicated only to CI and counterterrorism. It should take over the FBI's CI responsibilities, leaving it to deal only with domestic law enforcement. This new agency must have operational authority to look directly into the CI operations of the CIA and the military services. Only thus can it produce a comprehensive CI assessment, i.e., close the gaps between the FBI, CIA, and others. It should be responsible for disseminating its products to every agency of the government with a legitimate need. The new Homeland Security Department, of course, would head the list. Finally, it should be placed under the director of Central Intelligence as part of the intelligence community for resources, tasking, and policy.

Those who fear that such an agency could threaten American civil liberties have a point, but their concerns can be met with proper judicial and congressional oversight. Given today's realities, prudence dictates going ahead with an NCS but also building safeguards. A bigger danger is Attorney General John Ashcroft returning powers to the FBI that were taken away in the 1970s because it had abused them. It couldn't catch spies when it had these powers before. Why should we believe that the FBI can use them to catch spies and terrorists today?

100 percent error on the subject. We have forgotten too quickly the misjudgments of officials who once saw
Saddam Hussein as a responsible leader, counseled former president George H.W. Bush that the Arabs would
handle him (before Iraq seized Kuwait) and expected Hussein to be dumped by some anonymous colonel, at no
risk to the United States. If we are to avoid similar blunders in the future, then we must quickly clarify the suddenly
emerging muddle on Iraq.
Three points are most critical. First is the old adage that ""loose lips sink ships."" In this case, too many people in
the administration are doing too much talking, some urging the illusion of war on the cheap through new weapons
and internal uprisings, others just averse to the use of force. Both are undermining the resolve created by
President Bush's earlier pronouncements.
Such a collapse of discipline invites not only a torrent of bad advice, but also -- more important -- a worsening of
our credibility in the Persian Gulf, where our record is less than stellar. A brief recital of events in the past 30
years, ever since we unwisely allowed the British-run gulf security system to dissolve, establishes the point: the
undermining and fall of the shah of Iran and his replacement by an aggressive and fanatical Muslim regime; the
successful bombing of our embassy and Marines in Beirut, followed by a U.S. withdrawal; the
hostages-Iran-contra episode; and Saddam Hussein's post-Gulf War challenges (1993, 1994, 1996, 1998), none
of them effectively rebuked by American military power.
Sorry to say, both Republicans and Democrats have shared the blunders. The inconclusive Gulf War (and our
recent derring-do in Afghanistan) established our capabilities rather more than our wisdom in decisively ending
threats to our security and regional peace. Small wonder that local leaders (all of whom despise Saddam
Hussein) doubt we will do the job this time.
The second critical point is rejecting the fallacy that we must settle the Israeli-Palestinian war before we can do
anything about Iraq. This was false in 1990-91, and it remains untrue today. Those who counsel going to
Jerusalem before going to Baghdad will never complete either journey. Bush has already committed the United
States in support of the riskiest of propositions: a secure, democratic and peaceful Palestinian state. A successful
strike against Iraq will surely not hurt that prospect. Does anyone believe that a Saddam Hussein with a growing
arsenal of rocket-equipped weapons of mass destruction will help it?
A third and final point: The war with Hussein never ended. Whatever the merits of announcing a preemptive
military strategy or an objective of regime change, we need neither of these to justify action against Iraq. Iraq's
agreement that international inspectors would confirm the destruction of its weapons of mass terror was essential
to ending the Gulf War. Hussein has grossly violated these provisions since 1998. The U.N. Security Council is
united on the demand that inspectors must return, and even those Arab governments publicly opposed to an
attack on Iraq will, in almost the same breath, urge the Iraqis to cooperate on inspections. Thus, should we
choose to go to Baghdad, we would simply be saying to Hussein: We are enforcing the international mandate on
your weapons of mass destruction reached in 1991 and reaffirmed ever since. Stand in the way and you will be
destroyed. The alternative is to destroy your weapons. Period.
Some of those urging war on Iraq have suggested that we seek a fresh mandate from the United Nations. Of
course we should consult with our coalition partners. But to seek new Security Council resolutions after Hussein's
Page 56 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
blatant violations would also suggest that the previous clearly stated U.N. demands were irrelevant and
unenforceable. This is a sure way to discredit the United Nations.
To sum it up: We have a historical credibility problem in the gulf that will not be easily overcome through rhetorical
posturing or diplomatic niceties. We need less talk and more unity in Washington; a clear-headed presidential
exposition of why Iraq and why now, tied to the existing international consensus on weapons of mass destruction;
and regional actions that show our resolve and focus. Ultimately, an American foreign policy, or, for that matter,
an international order that allows a country such as Iraq to acquire weapons of mass destruction while violating
solemn agreements, is a guarantee of a world on the edge of greater terrors to come.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,79,107,2001,0.786680931,0.66312,29.3065918,32.3858915
"McInerney, Thomas",1994,1,2002-10-11,1,0,1,WSJ,Air Force,,,M,Liberation Blitz,Our objectives are as follows: Help the Iraqi people liberate Iraq; eliminate weapons of mass destruction and production facilities; protect economic and infrastructure targets; identify and terminate terrorism connections; and set up an interim government that will establish the process for a long-term stable and democratic Iraq.,"Barring a coup d'etat in Baghdad, it now appears certain that the U.S. will launch a major military strike on Iraq in
coming months. As President Bush made clear in his speech on Monday evening, such a strike would be
designed to prevent Saddam Hussein from providing weapons of mass destruction to terrorists groups such as al
Qaeda that could be used against the U.S.
In the past week, Congress has wisely rallied behind the president. Yesterday, the House overwhelmingly
approved a resolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq; at press time, the Senate looked certain to
follow. Consequently, I would like to discuss the strategy for a very swift military campaign of liberation that will
remove Saddam's despotic regime and his weapons of mass destruction.
Our objectives are as follows: Help the Iraqi people liberate Iraq; eliminate weapons of mass destruction and
production facilities; protect economic and infrastructure targets; identify and terminate terrorism connections; and
set up an interim government that will establish the process for a long-term stable and democratic Iraq.
The campaign to achieve these objectives will have numerous allies, sans the U.N., assisting this liberation force;
but without a doubt, the U.S. forces will be the leader of what I call ""blitz warfare."" This is an intensive (24-7),
precision air-centric campaign supported by small fast-moving ground forces composed of a mixture of heavy
armored, medium Marine, light-air mobile, and special covert operations to include opposition forces. Our forces
will use effects-based operations for the target set and correlate their timing of attacks to achieve rapid
dominance of those Iraqi forces that have not either defected or elected to remain neutralized.
This precision air campaign will be characterized by the use of many new satellite precision weapons (90%) using
our latest command, control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets that will be fused into a
Network Centric Configuration. We will use the Air Force's Global Strike Task Force and the Navy's Carrier Strike
Forces composed of over 1,000 aircraft to conduct the most massive precision air campaign in history. Blitz
warfare enables the attacking ground forces to be one-tenth the size of the defenders which is radically different
than the old ratio of the attacker being three to five times larger than the defenders. The speed of our ground
forces is more important than their size in blitz warfare.
This air power will achieve rapid dominance in the first 72 hours of combat. The targets are focused on
regime-change targets such as Saddam's leadership, command and control, weapons facilities, palaces, air
defenses, plus those military units that elect to resist.
Now let's discuss a notional campaign. I must emphasize that I am not privy to real-world plans that could risk
endangering our forces -- and do not want to be. However, I do want to let the American people know that the
Cassandras are painting a distorted picture of Saddam's capabilities, just as they did in 1991. This campaign will
be less difficult and quicker, but no cakewalk.
In a multi-directional campaign, coalition forces could initially seize the cities of Basra in the south and Mosul in
the north and most of the oil fields. Turkey already has 5,000 troops in Northern Iraq, so our ability to project this
blitz ground force with the simultaneous air attacks on Iraqi air defenses and border-covering forces will go very
rapidly, making it highly unlikely that Saddam will be able to launch attacks on neighboring countries and oil fields,
as he did in 1991.
Our stealth bombers and air superiority assets will neutralize Iraqi air defenses within 24 hours so we achieve air
dominance, which is critical to coalition success. The expansion of our beachheads in the north, south and west
Page 58 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
regions, with airheads being seized with alarming speed, will allow opposition forces to play a very helpful role in
determining the status (friend or foe) of the Iraqi Army for our advancing forces.
All the Iraqi military forces will be told through our ""information operations campaign"" that they have two choices:
either help us rebuild a democratic Iraq or be destroyed. In addition, commanders and men in weapons of mass
destruction units will be told that they will be tried as war criminals if they fire their weapons against coalition
forces or other nations.
Simultaneously, the political arm of the opposition will communicate to the Iraqi people that they are liberating
them from 22 years of oppression. The Iraqi people must help us to do this quickly with minimum loss of life. This
information operation campaign must be well planned and executed, as it will help cause a rapid disintegration of
any resistance to include the vaunted ""urban warfare"" of Baghdad.
It now appears that Saddam and his henchmen are trying to use the same propaganda that Hitler did when he
talked of his last redoubt in the Alps. Fundamentally, our information operation campaign will appeal to the Iraqi
army and people who have no love for this tyrant and will not die for him. Not a family in Iraq has gone unharmed
by his reign and we will send an enabling force to help them liberate their country.
This is not an invasion; it is liberation.
The Iraqi forces we are facing are about 30% of the Iraqi force in Desert Storm, with no significant modernization.
We are about ten times more effective with the addition of the B-2 Stealth Bomber, Joint STARS, the new drones,
Global Hawk and Predator plus the satellite guided Joint Direct Attack Munition, which allows our bombers to drop
up to 16 to 24 bombs simultaneously at different targets.
These additional capabilities will enable the coalition forces to conduct a campaign that will be over within 30 days
and have fewer casualties than we had in Desert Storm with a smaller attacking force. We should expect some
attempts at use of weapons of mass destruction against our forces. We can cope with this by moving fast and
with our appropriately equipped strike forces. In addition, we will specially target those geographical boxes that
Saddam's Scud missiles must move into to reach Iraq's neighbors.
We did not ask for this fight but we cannot hope it will go away. Hope is not a strategy. Our forces and our allies
are very capable of liberating the Iraqi people and we must act soon. The threat posed by Saddam and his
weapons of mass destruction will only worsen with time, and as President Bush told the world on Monday, ""We
refuse to live in fear.""

We -- and they -- are entitled to a full and fair accounting by our military authorities. Trying this case in the media would be a great injustice to both men, and to the service to which they belong.","On April 17, 2002, around 12:52 a.m., an Airborne Warning and Control Aircraft (Awacs) Controller told the two
F-16 pilots of Coffee 51 Flight, to ""Hold fire -- Need more details on Safire,"" the acronym for surface-to-air fire that
one of the pilots thought was tracking the other's aircraft. The two F-16s, in the sky near Kandahar, Afghanistan,
were on what is termed an ""on call interdiction"" mission, circling the area to respond to any calls from ground
units needing their cover fire. Shortly after the Awacs order to hold fire, the wingman -- Coffee 52 -- rolled in on a
target declaring, ""I got some men on a road and it looks like they are firing at us. I am rolling in in self-defense.""
American Rules of Engagement (ROE) always authorize a response in self-defense. Coffee 52 dropped a
500-pound laser-guided bomb and scored a direct hit on Alpha Company, 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's
Canadian Light Infantry, which was engaged in night live-fire training at Tarnak Farms Range. Four Canadian
soldiers were killed, and eight wounded.
Four minutes elapsed from the time Coffee Flight initially saw the firing on the ground to the time it released the
laser-guided bomb. Eight seconds after impact, Awacs called out ""friendlies.""
People make mistakes in the heat of combat. Was this one that we should accept as a tragic error and write off as
an honest mistake? Many were made during Desert Storm, when we had around 30% of our casualties attributed
to friendly fire. Why hadn't this live-fire exercise been briefed to the pilots, Maj. William Umbach and Maj. Harry
Schmidt, two very well-qualified pilots from the Illinois Air National Guard? What was the urgency of this target
that it had to be attacked after Awacs had already told Coffee 52 to ""Hold fire"" when he initially requested to fire
on the location with his 20mm cannon? We all know that they would not deliberately fire on friendly forces. What
went wrong that night?
The military has a process to answer these questions, and it is under way. Earlier, a Coalition Investigation Board
(CIB) found the cause of this friendly-fire incident to be the failure of the two pilots to exercise appropriate flight
discipline. This resulted in a violation of the ROE and inappropriate use of lethal force. Commander of the U.S.
Central Command, Gen. Tommy R. Franks, approved the CIB findings and returned the report to the Air Force for
action.
Last week, an Article 32 hearing (the military equivalent of a grand jury) started at Barksdale Air Force Base,
Louisiana. Prior to the start of the Article 32, the case had been well-publicized in the media by the pilots'
attorneys and supporters. Unfortunately, virtually all those who have appeared on television are not fighter pilots
and have not experienced surface-to-air fire at night. In addition, none were in the chain of command as a
General Court Martial Authority. Because I have served in both of those capacities, I want to explain the facts to
the public as I understand them.
We have an extraordinary amount of recorded audio and video to reconstruct this case and most of it is in the
public domain. I have personally reviewed the audio and video tapes from both cockpits plus talked to Air Force
members who have appeared at the Article 32 hearing.
The issue is whether Coffee 52, Maj. Schmidt, was acting in self-defense when he dropped the laser-guided
bomb on friendly forces. The initial evidence does not support this contention for several reasons. First, he had
been told to ""Stand by"" and ""Hold fire"" by the Awacs controller. Second, surface-to-air fire -- for those who have
experienced it at night -- is very easy to distinguish from ground-to-ground fire, and Maj. Schmidt apparently
mistook ground fire for fire aimed at his flight leader.
Page 60 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Coffee 51 Flight was at 18,000 feet or higher and surface-to-air fire is not very effective at that altitude -- which is
why they were there. Third, if the surface-to-air fire was tracking them, they took no evasive action nor discussed
it when it happened. There was never any urgency expressed on the audio recordings. Fourth, from the time he
locked his Forward Looking Infra Red Pod on the target there was no enemy fire coming at either plane according
to both their cockpit video recorders. After bomb impact, and only when asked by Awacs, Coffee 52's audio
recording did say ""it seemed like it [Safire] was tracking around us and trying to lead us, with some sort of
continuous fire with tops around 10,000 ft."" Fifth, the daily Air Space Control Order had stipulated that Tarnak
Farms was a Restricted Operating Zone (ROZ) with small arms firing up to 11,000 feet 24/7! Unfortunately, the
pilots had not seen this nor had their squadron intelligence briefed them about this continuous ROZ.
These facts compel me to say that there is sufficient reason for the CIB to have acted, and for the ongoing Article
32 investigation to proceed. We have an important obligation to protect the integrity of our Command and Control
System and our support of Coalition Ground Forces. People make mistakes in combat and we accept that, but
when it appears that there is a violation of the ROE we must investigate and take appropriate action. This was not
a split-second life-or-death decision. This was done during a very slow night of no combat activity by two very
skilled pilots.
That said -- and this cannot be stressed enough -- there is absolutely no evidence to support the ongoing,
spurious claims made in the media that ""go pills,"" faulty night-vision goggles, or, most incredibly, U.S.-Canada
relations had anything to do with why the ROE were violated that night above Afghanistan.
As Coffee 52 was exiting the area after being told by Awacs that there were ""friendlies"" in the area, he said, ""I
hope that was the right thing to do,"" and his leader, Coffee 51, responded, ""Me too."" Both men knew they would
be scrutinized closely for their actions that night. What counts most now is that the process of military justice be
fair, as I have every expectation it will be. The Air Force must continue to do the right thing, as must Majors
Schmidt and Umbach. A tragic mistake was made and four brave Canadian soldiers were killed and eight injured.

One thing we can offer in return is not something tangible, but something that North Korea might value highly: a formal pledge that the U.S. does not have hostile intent against North Korea. Much as we object to North Korea's treatment of its people, we do not plan to go to war to change it. We can live in peace. Only the U.S. can make this pledge, which is why direct talks are required.","While the world prepares to disarm Iraq of chemical and biological arms, by force if necessary, it does nothing as
a potentially larger disaster unfolds in North Korea -- loose nukes.
News reports indicate that North Korea has begun to move fuel rods containing six bombs' worth of plutonium
from its nuclear facility at Yongbyon, where it also announced yesterday it is restarting its reactor. For eight years,
since 1994, that plutonium has been stored at Yongbyon where it could be seen by on-site inspectors and, if
necessary, entombed by an air strike of precision bombs. Now it is being trucked away, perhaps to one of North
Korea's many caves, where it will be difficult to find or destroy.
This development undermines global nonproliferation efforts that have been successful for decades, and
represents an imminent danger to the security of the region. Even more, in an age of terrorism it poses the
additional specter of putting nuclear weapons into the hands of parties even more threatening than the North
Korean government. North Korea has few cash-generating exports other than ballistic missiles. Now nuclear
weapons or fissile material could take their place in its shopping catalogue. Or North Korea's government might
collapse, losing control of the nukes in the process. While hijacked airlines and anthrax-dusted letters are a
dangerous threat to civilized society, it would change the way Americans were forced to live if it became an
ever-present possibility that a city could disappear in a mushroom cloud.
---
North Korea has not been allowed to reprocess nuclear fuel rods to obtain weapons plutonium since 1989. In that
period, North Korea obtained a quantity of plutonium that it did not declare honestly to the IAEA, as it was
required to do. How much is uncertain, but estimates range as high as two bombs' worth. Whether it has had a
bomb or two for the past 15 years is not known, but for sure it is now only a few months away from obtaining six
bombs. The North Koreans might reckon that's enough to sell some and have some left over to threaten the U.S.
and its allies, South Korea and Japan.
North Korea also admitted last October that it aims to produce the other metal from which nuclear weapons can
be made -- uranium. It will be years, however, before that effort produces anything like the amount of fissile
material now being trucked from Yongbyon. The material at Yongbyon is the immediate threat.
Even if their nukes remain in the hands of the current government, a nuclear North Korea could prompt a domino
effect of proliferation in East Asia. South Korea once had a nuclear weapons program that it stopped because it
was persuaded its security could be assured without them. Will some in South Korea start to reconsider? Similar
questions might be asked in Japan and Taiwan -- questions no government wants asked.
We cannot wait for the Iraq situation to resolve itself while the North Korean government is taking actions that
cross a dangerous ""red line."" The North Koreans have chosen, as many predicted, the most inconvenient time to
take the wheel and drive out of Yongbyon. So far, they have been in the driver's seat. The U.S. needs to develop
a policy that gets its hands back on the wheel.
First, we must make it clear that the concealment or reprocessing of those rods constitutes an unacceptable
threat to our security and to the security of the region.
Second, we must repair our relations with South Korea, because no American strategy can succeed if it does not
have the support of our allies. Their national interests and ours are not identical, but they overlap strongly. South
Korea can provide vital assistance in persuading North Korea's leaders to change course -- or it can undermine
Page 4 of 82 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
our position if it is not persuaded we are right. Above all, our troops must stand shoulder to shoulder to deter
North Korean aggression.
Third, President Bush must begin now the diplomacy he has said will be his first resort for staving off a nuclear
setback on the Korean peninsula. No one can say whether diplomacy will work. Perhaps the North Koreans are
determined to attempt to get nuclear weapons despite our resolve and the world's condemnation. We can only
ascertain that by beginning direct talks.
Our position in that diplomacy must be clear: We require the complete and verifiable elimination of North Korea's
nuclear and missile programs. One thing we can offer in return is not something tangible, but something that
North Korea might value highly: a formal pledge that the U.S. does not have hostile intent against North Korea.
Much as we object to North Korea's treatment of its people, we do not plan to go to war to change it. We can live
in peace. Only the U.S. can make this pledge, which is why direct talks are required.
We can argue that since North Korea has enough conventional firepower on the DMZ to make war a distinctly
unpleasant prospect to us, it doesn't need nuclear weapons to safeguard its security. Far from guaranteeing
security, pursuit of nuclear weapons will force a confrontation. Once the nuclear program is gone, the relative
stability that will remain can provide the time and conditions for a relaxation of tensions, and, eventually, improved
relations if North Korea transforms its relations with the rest of the world.
---
The other thing the U.S. can offer is assistance with the process of dismantling the North's nuclear and missile
weapons and facilities, in a version of the historic Nunn-Lugar program that dismantled the former Soviet Union's
weapons of mass destruction.

highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps that is educated and trained to command America's racially diverse
enlisted ranks. A cohesive officer corps is essential to the military's ability to protect national security. This is not
an abstract academic goal, it is a combat imperative.
That is why the outcome of the University of Michigan affirmative action cases now before the Supreme Court is
so important to us. It will, inevitably, have a powerful effect on the ability of our fighting forces to fulfill their vital
mission.
Last month we joined 27 former top-ranking officers and civilian leaders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine
Corps -- including military academy superintendents, former secretaries of defense, and present and former
Senate leaders -- in submitting an amicus brief supporting the use of race-conscious admission policies. For the
good of the nation, the policies established by the Supreme Court in University of California v. Bakke must not be
overturned.
Over the past two decades, the military has made major progress in achieving a fully integrated, highly qualified
officer corps. It cannot maintain the diversity it now enjoys without the ability to recruit and educate a diverse
officer corps. The primary sources for the nation's officer corps are the ROTC and our service academies. The
academies use limited race-conscious recruiting and admissions policies. The pool of minority candidates at any
given ROTC member institution is limited by the number of minority students admitted. A cohesive military
requires a diverse officer corps, and it requires that our officers be educated and trained in diverse educational
settings.
During the 1960s and '70s, while integration increased the percentage of minorities in the enlisted ranks, the
percentage of minority officers remained disturbingly low. The perception of discrimination was the standard. This
contributed to low morale and heightened racial tension. The resulting danger is not theoretical, as the Vietnam
era demonstrated. As that war continued, the armed forces suffered increased racial polarization, pervasive
disciplinary problems and racially motivated incidents in Vietnam and in other places around the world. By the
early '70s, racial strife in the ranks was pervasive. The dearth of minority officers substantially exacerbated the
problems.
To resolve this threat to combat readiness, the armed services moved aggressively to diversify the officer corps
and, equally important, to train all officers in diverse educational environments. In full accord with Bakke and the
Defense Department's affirmative action program, the academies and the ROTC have set goals for minority
officer candidates, and they work hard to achieve those goals. They use financial and tutorial assistance as well
as recruiting programs to expand the pool of highly qualified minority candidates in a variety of explicitly
race-conscious ways. They also employ race as a factor in recruiting and admissions policies and decisions.
These efforts have substantially increased the percentage of qualified minority officers. Moreover, increasing
numbers of officer candidates are trained and educated in racially diverse educational settings, giving them the
irreplaceable educational benefits inherent in a mix that matches the nation's highly diverse enlisted ranks.
No workable alternative to limited, race-conscious programs currently exists that would increase the pool of
high-quality minority officer candidates and ensure diverse educational training for officers. The military's
aggressive minority recruiting programs must continue to increase the pool of qualified minority candidates.

The relevant questions are these: Will this second infusion be sufficient, and why weren't these troops there when the war started?","All of a sudden there is less talk of shock and awe, of lightning moves and a swift decision inthe war in Iraq. Our leaders are preparing us for a long struggle. At the same time, thedetermined Iraqi resistance has led to more heated talk about whether there are sufficientground troops in Iraq to do the job.
The fact is that more ground troops are needed. And more ground troops are on the way. Therelevant questions are these: Will this second infusion be sufficient, and why weren't thesetroops there when the war started?
In 1991, the Central Command, which has responsibility for the Persian Gulf region, hadseven-plus Army divisions, two Marine divisions, one French division and one Britishdivision, in addition to sizable Arab forces. All this to liberate Kuwait, a country about thesize of New Jersey. Today in Iraq, there are two Army divisions plus two separate brigades,a Marine division and a United Kingdom division, to conquer a country the size of California.
This disparity of forces is attributed to the advances in technology over the past 12 years.Yet despite our improved intelligence and smarter bombs, prudent planning still requiresthat sufficient ground forces be assigned to deal with all reasonable contingencies: poorweather; long, vulnerable supply lines; an enemy that decides to fight; an undecided, if notdownright hostile, civilian populace; and the use of guerrilla tactics.
The officials in the chain of command responsible for making decisions on troop strength arethe president, the secretary of defense and the head of the Central Command. Each has aconsiderable staff to help him develop and review plans. In 1990, Secretary of Defense DickCheney, using his staff and the Joint Chiefs, scrubbed the Central Command's initial plan,then reshaped it into the strategy that was subsequently executed with great success.
In that process, the rest of the military and the public knew that the stated needs of thecommander, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, were always given significant weight. Today,however, nobody outside a small circle of players knows exactly who developed the plan forthis invasion or what the prevailing views were.
Why Aren't There Enough Troops in Iraq?

There was an opportunity last summer to let senior military officials talk when the Senateheld hearings on giving the president authority to act in Iraq. Unfortunately, the DefenseDepartment's civilian leadership turned down a request from the Senate that officers likeGen. Tommy Franks, the head of Central Command, or any of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testify.Instead, the Senate committees got most of their input from a disparate group of retiredgenerals and civilians with wide-ranging views of the requirements for the campaign.
On Sunday, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said the invasion plan was ''essentially''put together by General Franks, and yesterday he said that it had the unanimous approvalof the Joint Chiefs. I'm sure that is true. However, it is not clear, in the give and take ofdeveloping the plan, who the key players were, who in the process gave ground, who amongthe National Security Council, the Pentagon officials and the Central Command staff hadtheir way. This is important because, while the central tenet of the military establishment iscivilian control, the concepts of accountability and responsibility are a close second andthird.
Over the past several months, many military officials have reported to the community ofretired officers that there were serious disagreements between the uniformed military andthe civilian leadership. Some have told me that those in uniform who called for using threeadditional divisions in Iraq were ridiculed for their ''old thinking.'' One retired four-stargeneral warned that this debate was about more than just invading Iraq -- that civilianswanted the war done in a new, leaner way to justify their vision of the ''transformationforce'' expected to be in place by 2010.
Last winter, Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, and Gen. James L. Jones, a formercommandant of the Marine Corps, both veterans of ground combat, expressed reservationsabout the paucity of Army and Marine divisions in the plan. And on the battlefield last weekLt. Gen. William S. Wallace, commander of the V Corps, said that the foe he is facing is verydifferent ''from the one we'd war-gamed against.''
In the White House, as in the Clinton administration, there is a belief among civilians thatmilitary technology has advanced to the point where wars can be won with relatively fewground forces. There will probably be a time in the future when this is so. Until then, soldiersand marines, in large numbers, will still be required to seize and hold terrain.
That we do not now have enough troops on the ground is not important in terms of theoutcome -- we will win and depose the regime in Iraq. However, the concept of risk in amilitary operation is not solely about winning and losing, it is also about the cost. In thiscase, the cost will be measured in American lives.

"McPeak, Merrill",1994,1,2003-04-02,1,0,1,NYT,Air Force,,,M,Shock and Pause,"The key is, and has always been, Baghdad. Our reception there, whether they throw bouquets or hand grenades, will determine our success or failure in the days ahead. Taking a pause was the right thing to do","The ''pause'' that British and American forces took on the road to Baghdad was a setback, right? After all,
hesitation looks bad, particularly when it follows sunny pronouncements of a warm reception in the Iraqi capital.
But as the coalition advance slowly resumes, we would do well to recall that the last few conflicts have taught us
that in warfare, winning sometimes involves looking bad for a while.
First, let's consider the Pentagon's plan. Using long-range air against an opponent whose only strength is in
short-range ground power is ''asymmetrical'' warfare in our favor. That is why in the 1991 Persian Gulf war we put
up a 39-day air campaign before ground forces jumped off. Thus the critics have a point asking why things seem
to have been reversed this time around.
But do they? Instead of holding back in Kuwait while we bombed the Iraqi Army as in 1991, American forces
headed for Baghdad -- the Third Infantry Division at the spearhead lost only one soldier during the advance. For a
time it looked as if the troops might even make it to the city. But those pesky unpredictables, in this case the
weather and a motivated militia force, got in the way.
Now 50 miles short of the city, the coalition forces are on the move again. Troops have been resupplied -- the
pause that refreshes -- and the air campaign has intensified. Flying about a thousand sorties a day, we've lost a
total of zero war planes -- in itself an amazing performance. The Republican Guard can either hunker down
outside Baghdad and die slowly, or maneuver and die quickly. Looks like pretty good tactics to me.
If there is a criticism to be made militarily, it concerns the shortage of air support from land bases. We are relying
to a great extent on cruise missiles, of which we have a limited supply; long-range bombers, which are not great
against moving forces; helicopters, which are vulnerable to ground fire; and air strikes from carriers, which can
carry only so many planes. Land-based tactical air is the First Team. Yet we don't have enough of it -- largely
because diplomatic failures cost us the use of air bases in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. (Here, I mean no criticism of
Secretary of State Colin Powell, who played the cards the White House dealt him as well as can be imagined.)
This means that a decisive air campaign may take longer than it would otherwise. Still, in every recent
engagement -- Kosovo and Afghanistan come to mind -- the criticism about long air campaigns hit full voice just
before the other side collapsed. So Americans should be patient. We can continue air attacks as long as we wish.
At some point our ground forces will be large enough for the next job.
The key is, and has always been, Baghdad. Our reception there, whether they throw bouquets or hand grenades,
will determine our success or failure in the days ahead. Taking a pause was the right thing to do.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,82,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915

-- Saddam Hussein
For all but the resolutely sightless, it is now obvious that air combat determines the outcome in modern war. In the
early hours of March 20, the salvo aimed at Saddam Hussein himself was preceded by nearly a month of air
attacks in and around Baghdad -- to say nothing of a decade or so of bombing in connection with enforcing the
no-fly zones. So it's incorrect to say that, unlike Desert Storm 12 years before, there was no independent air
campaign in advance of the jump off of our ground forces from Kuwait. Because of this aerial preparation, Iraq's
air defenses stayed mostly silent and our aircraft were able to begin reducing opposing ground forces
immediately. Army and Marine Corps formations, judged by ""experts"" to be much too small for the job, captured
Baghdad in just 22 days, and with comparatively light casualties. Not only did coalition air power systematically
disorganize Iraq's ground forces, it did so at small cost. It was more dangerous to be an embedded reporter than
to fly combat sorties.
Nevertheless, the coming flood of ""lessons learned"" will focus on a stale issue: Can advanced (principally
aerospace) technology substitute for large, heavy ground combat forces? That matter is settled. Because air
warfare is so plainly the centerpiece of modern combat, it would be far more productive to figure out how to fight it
better. This is not only more relevant but also trickier, because success is so poor a teacher. For instance,
munitions delivery has become almost too accurate: We sometimes used bombs that were defused because we
were more worried about collateral damage than about taking out the target. This is the sort of head-swelling
achievement that can make us immune to asking the tough questions.
The air war did feature lackluster performance involving two pieces of equipment: the Apache helicopter gunship
and the Patriot air defense missile. The Apache gives the ground commander his own close air support capability.
It's a fine aircraft and can be useful as part of a combined arms team -- that is, when supported organically by
Army artillery or from outside the Army by fast jets. The problem: The Army, ignoring recent scar-tissue building
experiences in Kosovo and Afghanistan, insists the Apache can be used for unsupported deep attack. The issue
here is control; the Army refuses to agree that a joint commander -- probably an Air Force officer -- should
coordinate air tasking, which would ensure the needed support.
On March 24 a battalion of 32 Apaches went deep -- and naked -- against the already much weakened Medina
Division of the Republican Guard. Every aircraft suffered battle damage; one was downed, and the others were
badly shot up. Interestingly, the fact that 31 came home is being touted as evidence of helicopter survivability.
After World War II, the assignment of roles and missions made the Army the only service that could not fly
fixed-wing combat aircraft. If it wanted to get into the air fight, the Army was stuck with the helicopter. It has been
making lemonade ever since.
Aircrews have no choice but to love the machine they fly. But make no mistake: Helicopters obey physical laws.
They are unlikely to achieve operationally useful amounts of speed or stealth, the best defenses against aimed
ground fire. As a practical matter, the Army should restrict the Apache to close air support -- or, if it must go deep,
hand it over for joint tasking.
Page 165 of 168 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The Patriot air defense missile seems to be performing well after modifications that corrected earlier deficiencies.
Too bad, as both the aircraft it shot down this time were friendly. We will eventually learn the technical reason for
this, probably a software glitch. But it's hard to figure out why Patriot crews should be so quick on the draw. First,
the Iraqi air force was simply not present for duty. More important, air defense is a ""system of systems,"" with
friendly fighter aircraft also responsible for preventing air attack. For 50 years -- indeed, since the establishment
of a separate Air Force -- the battle for control of the air has been fought well away from our ground forces -- over
the Yalu, over Hanoi, over Baghdad. No U.S. soldier has been attacked by an enemy aircraft since the early
1950s, a period that encompasses fully half the history of powered flight.
As with close air support, air defense is complicated and likely to disappoint, because unreliability is so often an
aspect of complexity. To make the best of a bad situation, most countries put fighter aircraft and theater missile
defenses in the same service, bringing to air defense the best integration tools available: a common culture and a
single-service chain of command. The United States, alone among countries that know what they're doing,
separates the fighters and missiles, creating a seam that has to be stitched up in the press of combat.
Both the Apache and the Patriot are great weapons systems, their recent failures not primarily technical but
organizational -- and, more deeply, cultural. A decade ago, while serving as Air Force chief of staff, I went quietly
to my Army counterpart, Gordy Sullivan, and proposed that we make a trade: swap the Air Force's primary close
air support aircraft, the A-10, for the Army's theater air defense missile, the Patriot. Had he agreed, Sullivan and I
would have faced bitter opposition from within our own services and probably could not have pulled it off. But I
thought it worth a try, because the result would have been much-improved integration of these two critical mission
areas -- close air support and theater air defense. In any case, Sullivan gave me the cold shoulder, claiming the
Army could not afford to operate the A-10. Of course, the real problem was not cost but an inability to imagine
how our combat effectiveness might be dramatically improved by bold, non-incremental change.
Memo to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld: Good luck with ""transformation.""",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,82,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915
"McFarlane, Robert",,0,2003-07-09,1,0,1,WSJ,Marine Corps,,,M,Gas That's Good For Us,The good news is that there is plenty of gas in stable parts of the world.,"Gas That's Good for Us
Three weeks ago Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in testimony before theHouse Committee on Energy and Commerce, drew our attention to America's heavyreliance on natural gas. It fuels our power plants, our homes and other industry, and putsvirtually every sector of our economy at risk if gas supplies are squeezed -- and prices rise-- in the months and years ahead. Although not much can be done to affect matters in thenext year or so, assuring adequate supplies of reasonably priced gas is a matter ofprofound consequence to us all.
The good news is that there is plenty of gas in stable parts of the world. The challenge isthat getting it to the U.S. market will require ingenuity, leadership and cooperationbetween the U.S. and foreign suppliers -- including Russia, the largest repository of gas inthe world.
The U.S. consumes 60 billion cubic feet of gas daily. Roughly 20% of it is imported --almost entirely from Canada (95%). U.S. production of natural gas is declining, as isCanada's. Russia possesses almost a quadrillion cubic feet of gas, enough to meet U.S.needs -- and indeed the needs of the entire world -- for several decades.
One might conclude that if this is true a solution to our problems lies in liquefying Russiangas and shipping it to the four liquefied natural gas (LNG) stations on the Gulf and Eastcoasts of the U.S. Analysts express confidence that Russian LNG could be delivered tothese terminals at between $4 to $5 per thousand cubic feet -- well below current gasprices. The figures would also suggest that Russia is truly in the catbird seat. As the gasreserves of the North Sea decline, Russia will have the opportunity to at least double itsexports to Western Europe -- a huge potential windfall for the Russian economy in theyears ahead.

Faced with these circumstances it would surprise most Americans to learn that Russiangas production is actually declining. Gazprom, the dominant state-controlled gascompany, cannot afford to get its considerable gas resources out of the ground and tomarket. This anomaly results from the huge subsidy built into domestic gas sales toRussian consumers -- Gazprom is required to deliver gas domestically below its cost ofproduction -- and the impossibility in such circumstances of accumulating the capitalneeded to develop new production. Russian President Vladimir Putin is well aware of theimperative of liberalizing the Russian energy sector; an opening of the market appearslikely after next year's elections. But we need not wait for that breakthrough. Russian gasis available for shipment today by private Russian companies if we are willing to devotethe time and resources needed to organize the trading relationships and infrastructureneeded to move it to our market.
This gas is located in the Yamal peninsula, a finger of tundra on Russia's Arctic coastcloser to New England than the Persian Gulf or most other plausible sources of LNG. Thereis more than 100 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves in the Yamal peninsula --enough to supply the U.S. LNG requirement for over 400 years.
The transport system needed to get this gas to the U.S. market is a daunting task from anoperational point of view. First it will be necessary to build a liquefaction plant on the
peninsula. And during the six months of the year that the northern reaches of the Yamalpeninsula are icebound it will be necessary to send Russia's nuclear-powered ice-breakersahead of LNG tankers to load and transport the gas to the U.S. But this is feasible -- it'sbeen done -- and a project to launch LNG trade between Russia and the U.S. could belaunched within weeks of a word of encouragement from both governments.
Such encouragement would lead to the availability of finance from export credit agenciesand to increased willingness of commercial lenders to believe in the project and to lend.Presidents Bush and Putin could provide such encouragement at the forthcoming U.S.-Russian Energy Summit in September in St. Petersburg.
Russia is also blessed with huge gas resources suffused within its massive coal reserves.In the coal mining region of west Siberia the methane (i.e. gas) resources are estimated atmore than 400 trillion cubic feet -- four times those of the Yamal peninsula. At the level ofrecovery anticipated this region could easily enable Gazprom or private developers tomeet European and Chinese needs for the indefinite future. To stimulate this energy-trading relationship, Russia needs investment capital and government encouragement.The capital is available from U.S. energy companies. The rest can be left to market forces.
* * *
Some will say that we cannot afford to become overly reliant on foreign sources of gas anymore than for oil. But is it not in America's interest to see Russia prosper and to seedemocracy and free enterprise take root there, gradually removing the specter of renewedCold War animosities? A good first step requires nothing more than making thedevelopment of Yamal gas for delivery to the U.S. a priority for both countries. Suchformal government encouragement would go far toward alleviating Mr.Greenspan'sconcerns.

Iraq. It will take no less than two years of inspired leadership, courageous soldiering and $100 billion to put that
nation back on its feet. Make no mistake, the air-ground-sea tactical victory by Gen. Tommy Franks's coalition
forces was nothing less than brilliant. But to finish the job we need more U.S. combat forces on active duty to
sustain the required force levels. We currently have 190,000 U.S. troops directly engaged in Iraq and Kuwait.
Without the overall troop strength to support our Iraq, Afghanistan and Korea deployments, we risk breaking the
back of the U.S. Army and Marine Corps in the coming 24 months.
Let's be clear here: Our troops' current morale is superb. Their courage in Afghanistan and Iraq was inspiring.
Their dedication and tactical competence mark them as the most effective fighting force the world has ever seen.
Innate respect for the law, self-discipline, tremendous initiative and sensitivity to protecting vulnerable civil
populations characterizes our military culture. It took us 15 years after Vietnam to create this proud fighting force.
We must be careful to preserve it while providing Gen. John Abizaid, the new commander of Centcom, the forces
he needs to build the security required.
Right now, U.S. active and reserve force-structure of infantry, military police, civil affairs, special operations,
aviation and field logistics formations are inadequate. Contractors and allies (now a tiny 7% of the coalition
supporting the effort) can mitigate some of the burden in Iraq. And if everything goes to plan, an additional 40,000
allies, organized in three multinational divisions, will be on the ground in Iraq by September. But we should be
skeptical about their military effectiveness, independent funding, and logistics support. The only long-term
solution is to create a well-trained and -equipped Iraqi police, civil defense corps, border guards, army and
contract security force. L. Paul Bremer, chief administrator, and Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of U.S.
ground forces, are seized of this effort. We must see to it that they have the cash, equipment and training
resources required for the mission.
Gen. Jack Keane, one of the most experienced and thoughtful Army officers we have, has laid out the global
rotation plan for the near term. If you analyze the plan, the U.S. Army is very close to being overextended. The
risk is too great. Our active strength of 491,000 is too small. Twenty-four of our 33 active brigades (73%) are
deployed. Fifteen of our 45 National Guard battalions are deployed. Some 368,000 Army soldiers are deployed to
120 foreign nations. We are in a global war on terror with inadequate forces.
We must immediately call up nine National Guard Brigades (not just the two currently planned) and keep them
permanently in the force structure, returning the Guard soldiers to civil life after 12-month tours. We should then
sustain these additional units through active-duty recruiting. The current rate of return to active duty is far too
high, and runs the risk of driving away our reserve component. About 22% of the 900,000 available Guard and
Reserve forces of all services are now on temporary duty.
The U.S. is dealing with the consequences of success. Our resolve has made us immeasurably more secure
since Sept. 11, 2001. Yet history will judge us on how well we sustain our accomplishments in Afghanistan and
Iraq. Our war on terror has achieved great initial results. Now we must finish the difficult phase of ensuring the
fruits of our victory.",10,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,82,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915

talks with the U.S., China, Russia, South Korea and Japan. This was welcome but it changes nothing
fundamental. Kim Jong Il has clearly demonstrated his capacity for falsehood in multilateral as well as bilateral
forums. The bigger, and much worse, news is the overall course of events this summer.
In early July, krypton 85, a gas produced when spent nuclear fuel is reprocessed into plutonium for nuclear
weapons, was detected coming from North Korea. This means that in a few months it could have several
additional bombs' worth of plutonium. Add this to Pyongyang's breach of the 1994 Agreed Framework by its
secret uranium-enrichment program, and its boast in April that it would sell weapons-grade plutonium to
whomever it pleased (rogue states? terrorist groups?), and it is apparent that the world has weeks to months, at
most, to deal with this issue, not months to years.
Interdiction of shipments out of North Korea will not stop the export of such fissionable material. Even if current
efforts to intercept North Korean shipping are successful, this would be completely inadequate to the purpose.
The plutonium needed for a bomb is about the size of a soccer ball. There is no reason the North Koreans would
refrain from using air shipments, including those protected by diplomatic immunity, to smuggle and sell such
material.
In the midst of the just-announced six-way talks, one fact stands out: The only chance for a peaceful resolution of
this crisis before North Korea moves clearly into the ranks of nuclear powers is for China to move decisively.
Indeed we see no alternative but for China to use its substantial economic leverage, derived from North Korea's
dependence on it for fuel and food, to press, hard and immediately, for a change in regime. Kim Jong Il's regime
has shown that agreements signed with it, by anyone, mean nothing.
What could induce China to follow such an uncharacteristically decisive course? North Korea's escalating nuclear
aspirations run the risk of creating not one but four new nuclear powers in Asia. South Korea, Japan and probably
Taiwan will find it very difficult to refrain from moving toward nuclear capability as North Korea becomes more
threatening. Also, China must be clearly told that North Korea's long-range ballistic missile program and the
prospect of its sale of fissionable material to terrorists make this a direct matter of U.S. security. Presidents Bush
and Roh declared in May that they will ""not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea.""
Unfortunately, the reflexive rejection in the public debate of the use of force against North Korea has begun to
undermine U.S. ability both to influence China to act and to take the preparatory steps necessary for
effectiveness if force should be needed. The U.S. and South Korea must instead come together and begin to
assess realistically what it would take to conduct a successful military operation to change the North Korean
regime.
It is not reasonable to limit the use of force to a surgical strike destroying Yongbyon. Although the facility would
need to be destroyed, the possible existence of another plutonium reprocessing plant, uranium-enrichment
facilities or plutonium hidden elsewhere makes it infeasible to limit the use of force to a single objective.
Moreover, military action against North Korea must protect South Korea from certain attack, particularly from
artillery just north of the DMZ that can reach Seoul. In short, we must be prepared to win a war, not execute a
strike.
U.S. and South Korean forces have spent nearly half a century preparing to fight and win such a war. We should
not be intimidated by North Korea's much-discussed artillery. Around half of North Korea's 11,000-plus artillery

pieces, some of them in caves, are in position to fire on Seoul. But all are vulnerable to stealth and precision
weapons -- e.g., caves can be sealed by accurate munitions.
Massive air power is the key to being able both to destroy Yongbyon and to protect South Korea from attack by
missile or artillery. There is a significant number of hardened air bases available in South Korea, and the South
Koreans have an excellent air force of approximately 550 modern tactical aircraft. The U.S. should begin planning
immediately to deploy the Patriot tactical ballistic missile defense system plus Aegis ships to South Korea and
Japan, and also to reinforce tactical air forces by moving in several air wings and aircraft carrier battle groups,
together with the all-important surveillance aircraft and drones.
The goal of the planning should be to be prepared on short notice both to destroy the nuclear capabilities at
Yongbyon and other key North Korean facilities and to protect South Korea against attack by destroying North
Korean artillery and missile sites. American cruise missiles and stealth aircraft, equipped with precision bombs,
will be crucial -- these weapons can be tailored to incinerate the WMD and minimize radiation leakage.
The key point is that the base infrastructure available in the region and the accessibility of North Korea from the
sea should make it possible to generate around 4,000 sorties a day compared to the 800 a day that were so
effective in Iraq. When one contemplates that the vast majority of these sorties would use precision munitions,
and that surveillance aircraft would permit immediate targeting of artillery pieces and ballistic missile launch sites,
we believe the use of air power in such a war would be swifter and more devastating than it was in Iraq. North
Korea's geriatric air defenses -- both fighter aircraft and missiles -- would not last long.
Marine forces deployed off both coasts of North Korea could put both Pyongyang and Wonsan at risk of rapid
seizure, particularly given the fact that most of North Korea's armed forces are situated along the DMZ. With over
20 of the U.S. Army's 33 combat brigades now committed, it would be necessary to call up additional Reserve
and National Guard units. However, the U.S. forces that would have the greatest immediate effect are
Expeditionary Air Forces and Carrier Battle Groups, most of which have been removed from the Iraqi theater.
The South Korean Army is well equipped to handle a counteroffensive into North Korea with help from perhaps
two additional U.S. Army divisions, together with the above-mentioned Marine Expeditionary Force and dominant
air power. We judge that the U.S. and South Korea could defeat North Korea decisively in 30 to 60 days with such
a strategy. Importantly, there is ""no doubt on the outcome"" as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Richard Meyers, said at his reconfirmation hearing on July 26 to the U.S. Senate.
Nobody is eager to see force used on the Korean peninsula. We can hate it that we are forced now to confront
this choice. But we should not take refuge in denial.",9,Warfighting,,,,,,,82,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915

It's not likely that Hussein's overture this week will stay Bush's hand.

Now the president must also make it clear that he is prepared to commit whatever troops are necessary to bring a war with Iraq to a speedy and victorious conclusion. The war will not need anything like the numbers used in Desert Storm, but it cannot be done on the cheap, as was done in Afghanistan. It is presumptuous for those outside the Pentagon to calculate the exact number of troops needed, but it will certainly be more than 100,000.

There is a powerful strategic argument for dispatching a sizable American force and not trying to use the Iraqi opposition as a proxy. Psychologically, the Iraqi army and even the Republican Guards must be convinced that the United States is absolutely committed to Hussein's overthrow and that they are doomed to destruction if they oppose it. The larger the army deployed against them the more it will become clear that resistance is futile and the less resistance we will face. The more powerful the force arrayed against them, the more likely Iraqi commanders will realize that resorting to chemical or biological weapons will not stave off defeat but simply put them before a tribunal once the war is over.

Just the buildup of forces on their border will have a depressing psychological effect on those in Hussein's army. The Iraqis know from the Gulf War that they are no match for the Americans. The president should capitalize on this fear and drive home the point. The Iraqi armed forces are a shadow of their pre-Gulf War selves, but they are still formidable -- too formidable for the United States to use the Afghan model of relying on local proxies supported by American air power and Special Operations forces.

According to unclassified sources, the Iraqi army is about half the size of that pitted against a half-million-man coalition force in 1991. Except for favored Republican Guards, it suffers severely from a shortage of spare parts, poor maintenance and a resulting lack of mobility. Of its 2,200 tanks, at least half are estimated to be nonoperational. The army is made up mostly of infantry divisions. Unclassified sources indicate that it is spread over the length and breadth of Iraq -- unlike during the Gulf War, when it massed facing Saudi Arabia. Two corps are in the north in Iraqi Kurdistan, one in the south facing rebellious Shias and two facing Iran. Iraqi morale is considered questionable and fighting ability marginal. These five corps are backed up and kept under surveillance by two Republican Guard corps, one in the north and one near Baghdad to the south. The Republican Guards are the cream of the Iraqi armed forces, but they are widely separated and have only two armored divisions and three mechanized divisions between them. Saddam Hussein also has a Special Republican Guard for his protection, made up of four loyal and well-armed brigades. These forces protect Baghdad.

Given that the Iraqi army and the Republican Guards are spread out, an American ground attack out of Turkey in the north and from Kuwait in the south would force the Iraqis to fight on multiple fronts, allowing it to be defeated piecemeal. Iraqi commanders recognize this and know their vulnerability. They also know that their air defenses will be destroyed in the opening days of combat, leaving them helpless in the face of American air attacks.

Though Hussein opponents are not powerful enough to serve as the main anti-Hussein force, they can be useful in targeting these strikes, as was done in Afghanistan. Supported by American Special Operations forces, their greatest value is as a magnet to draw opposing Iraqi forces out of their barracks and into the open, allowing American air power to attack them. The dissidents could also be useful in encouraging civilian and tribal uprisings.

By concentrating U.S. air power on the Iraqi military in the field, and not on Iraq's infrastructure, as was the case in the Gulf War, civilian casualties would be minimized. But it would probably force retreating military units loyal to Saddam Hussein to fall back on the cities, where American power would be less effective. Fighting in cities is a nasty business, accompanied by terrible casualties all around, to say nothing of the destruction wrought. This may be Hussein's plan, as there are reports that the Iraqis are digging trenches and erecting fortifications around urban centers. But historically, when a regime's army is defeated in the field and loses control of the countryside, troops trapped in cities don't hold out long. The Iraqis are credited with having a substantial tactical and strategic chemical and biological capability. That is their key strength, and it makes sense that in his bid to survive, Saddam Hussein would try to use that capability. It should be made clear that any officer who authorizes chemical or biological weapons, even if ordered to do so by Baghdad, will be treated as a war criminal.

The United States knows where some of the sites of weapons of mass destruction are, but not all of them. A vigorous intelligence campaign would be needed to locate and destroy those weapons. Even then there is no guarantee of getting them all. But chemical and biological weapons, once they are released on the battlefield, can be a greater danger to the user than to his intended target. American forces have far better protective clothing and equipment than do the Iraqis. Defense against mobile Scud missiles armed with poison warheads depends on early detection by satellites and manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, and their speedy destruction by precision-guided munitions and Patriot missiles. Special Operations teams would have to play a major role in tracking down hidden and mobile launchers.

When attacked by American bombs and missiles the Iraqi armed forces will be challenged to look to the better interests of Iraq -- and to their own survival. It should be made clear to the Iraqis that those who stay neutral or join in Hussein's demise will be treated well. Those who resist will continue to be attacked. Saddam Hussein and his regime must go, and the sooner the better. But the strategy of the U.S. military campaign is important. The campaign must be decisive, swift and psychologically devastating for Iraqi forces. Undermining the military support for the Baghdad regime is key to rapid success and to keeping American casualties to a minimum.",9,Warfighting,,,,,,,82,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915
"McFarlane, Robert",,0,2003-09-26,1,0,1,NYT,Marine Corps,,,M,What's Good for Russia is Good for America,"While it is true that America's roots are more deeply intertwined with the countries of Western Europe,the United States need not choose between Russia and Europe. It will always be in America's interest to cooperate with both. ","As President Bush meets with President Vladimir Putin of Russia today and tomorrow at Camp David, he should take the opportunity to chart a new course for Russian-American relations. The logic for such a change is compelling, especially regarding United States interests in Iraq, and it is clear to Russian officials in both government and industry.

This new thinking is the product of several factors involving the common experience of Russia and the United States as victims of terrorism and a common interest in nurturing greater stability in the Middle East. The countries' complementary capacities could accelerate the rebuilding of Iraq and help to end the violence there.

Russia and the United States have had similar experiences with terrorism. Both countries have seen violence in their major cities: the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center and the attack by Chechen terrorists on a theater in Moscow a year ago. The shattering impact of these events galvanized in the United States and Russia a determination to counter the terrorist menace.

Russia was -- and remains -- very helpful in the American campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. And whatever may have been their differences over how to deal with Saddam Hussein, President Putin agreed with President Bush that Saddam Hussein was a destabilizing influence in the Middle East.

Similarly, both have come to recognize the unacceptable implications of a nuclear-armed Iran. Chastened by the International Atomic Energy Agency's discovery of traces of enriched uranium at a power plant in Natanz, Iran, Russia has become much more demanding of credible safeguards for the Iranian nuclear program. It is also cooperating with the United States in seeking to deal with the nuclear ambitions of North Korea.

In a larger sense, an inchoate but palpable evolution in Russian thinking has been taking place. President Putin has absorbed a core value of pluralistic governance: nations operating under some measure of popular restraint are less likely to make war.

Mr. Putin has shown himself ready to join the United States in nurturing an evolution in this direction in the Middle East. Talking to reporters last month, he said Russia would support an international force in Iraq -- even under United States command -- if it were authorized by the United Nations Security Council. Such a statement would have been unthinkable six months ago.

But perhaps the greatest incentive for the United States to bring Russia into a more active role in Iraq is self-interested pragmatism. Russians know a lot more about the Iraqi infrastructure and how to repair it than Americans do (after all, they built much of it), and they are ready to join in the effort to restore power, water and other necessities of daily life. And since Russia has solid relationships with tribal leaders throughout the country, it is better able to gain their help. And it would be far better to get Iraqis involved in guarding their own patrimony than to have to rely on foreign forces.

True, Russia's motives -- like America's -- are not entirely altruistic. In return for its physical and financial involvement in rebuilding Iraq, Russia will want assurance that the oil contracts signed by Russian companies before the war will be honored. The United States should accept this, not least because it has no legal basis for denying these contracts.

Beyond helping to bring stability to the Middle East and revenue to Russian economy, Russian involvement will have benefits for the Russian people. Elevating Russia's role in dealing with the most daunting problems on the global agenda will have a profound impact on the view of average Russians about themselves, their leaders, their country and their role in world affairs.

The last decade has been traumatic for the Russian people. They lost two-thirds of their per capita income, half of ''their'' territory and their superpower status. To be once more engaged and contributing to the solution of vital matters will have an incalculable effect on Russia's sense of place and its commitment to a constructive role in the years ahead.

While it is true that America's roots are more deeply intertwined with the countries of Western Europe, the United States need not choose between Russia and Europe. It will always be in America's interest to cooperate with both.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,82,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915
"Bacevich, Andrew",1992,1,2003-10-12,1,0,1,WaPO,Army,,,M,"Lower Expectations, Set a Date, and Leave","Those of us who experienced Vietnam firsthand are perhaps too quick to shout quagmire at the first sign of a war going awry. Iraq is not Vietnam. Comparing the two may offer a useful device for discomfiting the Bush administration, but it provides little in terms of policy analysis.","Those of us who experienced Vietnam firsthand are perhaps too quick to shout quagmire at the first sign of a war
going awry. Iraq is not Vietnam. Comparing the two may offer a useful device for discomfiting the Bush
administration, but it provides little in terms of policy analysis.
So forget Vietnam. Instead, listen to what today's military leaders, innocent of personal involvement in that earlier
war, have to say. Gen. John Abizaid, the theater commander, has forthrightly categorized the situation in Iraq as
a ""classical guerrilla-type campaign."" Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of U.S. forces actually fighting that
war, tells us that resistance is increasing and that the enemy is becoming progressively more sophisticated.
What is implied by this assessment? Guerrilla wars tend to be protracted, as this one almost certainly will be.
They also tend to be ugly, politically complex and morally ambiguous -- qualities on display daily in Baghdad and
the Sunni Triangle. Guerrilla wars consume resources at a prodigious rate. Moreover, they do not play to the
strong suit of either American soldiers, who are impatient to finish the job and go home, or the American people,
who are impatient, period.
What to do about this predicament? Thus far, the policy debate has been a sterile one. The Bush administration
insists to an increasingly incredulous public that the United States must pay any price and bear any burden for
Iraqi freedom. Critics, meanwhile, citing the failure to find weapons of mass destruction as proof that the war was
unnecessary in the first place, promote the French position -- calling on Bush to admit his error and beg for
forgiveness.
Neither of these two positions withstands serious scrutiny. Absent a remarkable turnaround on the battlefield --
one that field commanders themselves do not foresee -- the pay-any-price option may be militarily unsustainable
as well as politically untenable. Assuming that the Democrats manage to unite around an electable candidate (by
no means a foregone conclusion), hanging tough could cost Bush the election -- as Bush political adviser Karl
Rove no doubt understands.
But a cut-and-run approach is equally implausible and would not serve the interests of the United States, Iraq or
even those nations currently indulging in the peculiar satisfactions of schadenfreude. Humiliating and discrediting
the world's only superpower will neither improve the prospects of winning the war on terrorism nor advance the
cause of what is loosely termed world peace.
Midway between pay-any-price and cut-and-run is a third option. It carries its own risks, but is certainly preferable
to the other two. This third option consists of the following:
First, lower our expectations about what military intervention can accomplish. Jettison rhetoric about a
""generations-long"" commitment aimed at imprinting American-style democracy on Iraq and transforming the entire
Middle East. In Baghdad, settle for a stable regime adhering to the international rules of the game.
Second, reduce the exposure of our troops and the burden imposed on the U.S. military and taxpayer. In short,
internationalize the occupation by conceding greater authority to the United Nations in exchange for troops and
money -- if the U.N. is not feeling too wounded or disrespected to accept the burden. Do this not because the
U.N. represents efficiency, effectiveness or moral authority -- it does not -- but because an open-ended effort at
nation-building, which is at best tangential to vital U.S. interests, is unaffordable and because the preoccupation

with Iraq detracts attention from more important priorities. In short, raise the blue flag in Baghdad and raise the
Stars and Stripes elsewhere. (And if Iraq does become a quagmire, let it be Kofi Annan's.)
Third, establish a schedule for drawing down U.S. forces and stick to it. Among other things, a phased reduction
of the U.S. presence would make clear that this is not a neocolonial occupation of indefinite duration. In doing so,
it will deprive the insurgent cause of its chief claim to legitimacy -- the notion that only violence will drive the
Americans out. Experts may quibble over when to complete that withdrawal, but one year after the fall of Baghdad
might make a nice benchmark. Certainly two years would suffice.
The idea informing this alternative is not to cut and run but to see that, contrary to President Bush's claims, Iraq is
not the ""central front"" in the war on terrorism. Recognizing that the real gains to be derived from Operation Iraqi
Freedom are quite modest will permit the United States to do two things: refocus the national security apparatus
on the pursuit of terrorists who, unlike Saddam Hussein, actually pose a proximate threat to the United States,
and assuage international concerns that 9/11 somehow converted the world's only superpower from a benign
hegemon into a dangerous rogue nation.
Americans of the Wilsonian persuasion are right to dismiss as paternalistic suggestions that Arabs are somehow
incapable of democracy. But they are themselves hardly less guilty of paternalism in suggesting that the
emergence of Arab democracy requires extensive tutelage by the United States. Let us wish the Iraqis well in
their pursuit of freedom, self-government and the rule of law. And let us show them the respect of letting them
select their own path.",6,Warfighting,,,,,,,82,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915

for the Iraq war: Iraq is better off, he suggested, and the rest of the world, including the United States, is safer
with Saddam Hussein gone. The Iraqi people will render judgment on the first point after the coalition forces have
departed and their new political course is set.
But the president does not have a constitutional duty to make Iraq a better place. He does have a constitutional
duty to protect and defend the United States. So, regardless of the final outcome in Iraq, the administration's case
for going to war -- and now, for how it deals with the aftermath of ""major combat operations"" -- must rest on
whether Americans are more secure. In our judgment, we are not.
The argument that America is safer rests on two premises: first, that Iraq posed a threat to this country that has
now been eliminated; second, that the war did not increase or create other threats. We believe both are incorrect.
The administration's primary justifications for the war were the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, especially nuclear weapons, and its links to al Qaeda. Neither claim has been borne out. Saddam, it
is increasingly clear, was safely in a box and was being kept there. But the case that America is less safe today
does not rest solely on the argument that Iraq posed no near-term threat. The Iraq war itself has made this
country less safe. There are six reasons why.
* The U.S. military, especially the Army, has been stretched to the breaking point and has very limited capability
to respond to a crisis on the Korean Peninsula or elsewhere. This situation is likely to last several years and be
compounded by declining enlistment, which is already affecting the National Guard and Reserve forces.
* The Iraq war has diverted resources from the effort to combat terrorism, the primary threat to our security. With
our intelligence, military and economic resources concentrated in Iraq, the Taliban has reconstituted itself in
Afghanistan and is challenging the Kabul government. The diversion of resources has also given Osama bin
Laden's organization the opportunity to regroup.
* The drain on the national budget is pulling money away from critical homeland security needs. The $87 billion
requested for Iraq and Afghanistan next year is almost the exact amount recommended in vain by an outside
panel to fund port security, first-responder training and equipment and other needs for the next five years.
* If Saddam did have some WMD, they are now loose in a dangerous part of the world where many groups and
nations do not wish us well.
* We have created a failed state in Iraq. There is currently no effective control of its borders. Radical Arabs from
outside Iraq have answered Bush's call to ""bring 'em on"" and entered the shooting gallery. They do not speak
English. They do not have passports or flight training. They were unlikely, before the war, to be able to attack us
here. But they can take their AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades and attack our troops next door in Iraq. This
may also have opened up a fertile recruiting and training ground for al Qaeda.
* Finally, our unilateralism has weakened and embittered our allies and undercut the United Nations. The United
States cannot defeat terrorism or successfully conclude the Iraqi campaign without them.

The threat to the United States posed by Saddam was greatly overstated. The reasons for that are not yet clear.
What is clear is that the dangers created by the president's decision to go to war must be addressed. We cannot
cut and run.
The most urgent task is to relieve the heavy burden on the U.S. Army, the troops and their families. They are
virtually the only Americans now sacrificing in this war. The new Iraqi army will help but not soon enough. If we
are unable or unwilling to make the political compromises to secure a U.N. mandate that will allow substantial
international participation, we will have to call up more National Guard and Reserve units in the short run and
expand the Army as soon as possible. We simply must reduce deployment rates and end ""stop loss"" orders that
keep service men and women in the military involuntarily, to the detriment of their family life and their jobs. If we
do not act soon, we may not be able to achieve recruitment levels to sustain the Army's current size, let alone
expand it.
Equally urgent is accounting for the weapons of mass destruction. We need an honest appraisal of what was
there and, if the weapons still exist, where they went. They may well be the most lethal legacy of the war.
The task in Iraq is to transfer decision making at the local and national levels to Iraqis, to reduce the visibility of
the U.S. presence and dampen hostility. This will be easier if the United Nations is engaged and troops from
countries acceptable to the Iraqi authorities participate. Reconstruction assistance must be speeded up and key
infrastructure projects must be offered to non-U.S. countries and companies.
There are two other overarching imperatives in the war on terrorism. We must refocus, no longer viewing Iraq as
its ""central front."" Iraq is more Gallipoli than Normandy. And we must stop trying to conduct the war on the cheap
without asking for sacrifices from anyone but military members and families. Our long-term safety also depends
on paying for operations abroad and security at home and not passing the bill to our children.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,82,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915

the heart of the Islamic world. Leaving precipitously would create a smoldering hole, a failed state on the frontier
between the Sunni and Shiite worlds. An imploding Iraq could become a strategic threat at least as grave as that
posed by Saddam Hussein. Let's face it: We're in Iraq for the long haul.
This responsibility isn't the sort that can be handed over to another nation or group of nations. Recent U.S. efforts
to recruit forces from other countries remind me of the ""many flags"" effort by President Johnson during the
Vietnam War. That wasn't too successful, either. Iraq will remain a predominantly American mission.
But it can be a successful mission, especially if we bear in mind lessons from places such as Bosnia. Like Iraq,
Bosnia was deeply divided along ethnic and religious lines, and many people believed that our peacekeeping
efforts there would be long, costly and futile. Yet after eight years of international presence, Bosnia is stable.
Our Bosnia experience suggests that the United States must allow time for Iraq's rival factions to make the kind of
deals that will cement their nation together. That slow process of accommodation will only take place if we create
the conditions for compromise.
Time is essential. In his classic book about Bosnia, ""The Bridge on the Drina,"" Ivo Andric describes how an
informal contract between a farmer and a merchant emerges unexpectedly from ""futilities and generalizations . . .
as if by some ancient ritual."" So many times in Bosnia, cooperation materialized in this way. In August 1999, for
instance, the intelligence services of rival ethnic groups worked together to apprehend individuals allegedly
planning an attack on heads of state at a conference in Sarajevo. The relations we had fostered with the factions
over several months made that cooperation possible.
In Bosnia, as in Iraq, immediate events and preconceptions clouded our progress. Once we took a reporter to a
community that had just been resettled by Bosniaks. Years before, Serbs had viciously ""cleansed"" the place, yet
about 80 families resettled there despite the shocking memory. This return and others in Serbian parts of the
country changed the pattern in Bosnia. But our visitor was not impressed. The snippet on national TV focused
instead on our failure to capture former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic.
With the media's propensity to be drawn to the violence and casualties, the American public does not often see a
truly balanced view of work done by U.S. forces in Iraq. Even if one were skeptical of the details coming from the
administration, the progress is staggering. Schools have been rebuilt, teachers retrained, universities and
hospitals reopened, newspapers published and police training begun. Visit for a few days and the pattern does
not emerge. Come back in a year and the difference may seem striking.
Yet patience is hard to sustain when Baathist hard-liners and Islamic fighters from other countries continue to
attack our will by killing our soldiers and civilians. But as intelligence improves and our troops adapt and invent
new tactics, the insurgent leaders will come off the game board. As economic opportunity accelerates, the less
doctrinaire foes will fade away and leave behind an isolated hard core that will be easier to target.
Though the subject of hot debate now, the fiscal cost of the operation in Iraq will not pose our biggest challenge.
By April, unless we increase the planned call up of National Guard units and commit Marine brigades to the Iraq

effort, troop levels will have to fall to somewhere between 46,000 and 80,000. The situation on the ground may
not require the current levels of troops past next spring. But even smaller deployments will tax soldiers, families
and unit leadership.
From the Army's decision to keep units together, one can predict that troops finishing a year in Iraq will face only
a year's respite before returning. In the Balkans, we learned that with 18 months to recover between six-month
tours in harm's way, soldiers and families would reenlist. That's less likely now that we are asking soldiers to
sustain cycles of one year on, one year off -- a very heavy commitment.
While the administration did a poor job of preparing the American public for the strains of peacekeeping in Iraq,
we cannot leave until a stable Iraq becomes a reality. From our experience in the Balkans, important lessons
resonate. Patience and an understanding of the subtleties of the local culture are vital. We must avoid allowing

The American intent has been clear from the start. The military must establish a degree of security that will allow
the coalition to achieve the three key goals of establishing a stable, representative government, restoring basic
services to a deprived population and building a free-market economy from a failed socialist state. The problem is
that an anti-coalition insurgency has gotten out of hand and has created serious security problems, especially in
the triangle region around Baghdad.
Conventional wisdom asserts that winning the hearts and minds of the people is absolutely essential to success
in an insurgency. Certainly U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine based on our experience in Vietnam and even as far
back as the Philippine insurrection at the turn of the last century validates this dictum. U.S. forces clearly pursued
this objective when they started their counterinsurgency campaign this past summer -- but with mixed success.
Until early October, U.S. and coalition forces attempted to treat the entire civilian population (Shiites, Kurds,
Sunnis, Turkomen, Assyrians) with kid gloves throughout the country. As the violence escalated -- helicopters
shot down, fixed sites bombed, patrols and convoys ambushed, police and political leaders targeted -- it became
clear that U.S. forces would have to be more aggressive in the insurgent strongholds in the Sunni Arab region.
Reviewing progress in pacifying the Sunni Triangle, I believe that American military leaders finally concluded that
their restrained tactics were not dampening the insurgency and were never going to win the hearts and minds of
the Sunnis as long as the people were dominated by former regime loyalists and the insurgents. So why try? It
was time to take off the gloves.
That is exactly what we are seeing: large, well-coordinated cordon and search operations prompted by the best
available intelligence; willingness to enter known insurgent strongholds and directly engage the enemy even
though these areas might be heavily populated; destruction of insurgents' homes with smart bombs; and sweep
operations that round up all likely suspects and turn them over to trained Arab interrogators for determination of
their true status -- insurgent or innocent. These aggressive operations, which are very much like those employed
by the Israeli Defense Forces, are daring and risky, but it appears this campaign is beginning to take insurgents
off the street and, more important, is developing useful intelligence that leads to further fruitful operations.
This is a virtuous cycle for the United States, but time may not be on our side. Will our aggressive tactics produce
success before we inflame the entire Iraqi population as well as the Sunnis against us? Will Muslim, and perhaps
world, opinion, which has thus far been relatively quiet, turn further against U.S. efforts in Iraq?
We have some yardsticks we can use to measure progress. Do the insurgent attacks in the Sunni Triangle abate?
Do we capture or kill Saddam Hussein and Izzat Ibrahim, one of his top aides? Does the security situation
improve enough to reestablish Iraqi police and security forces in the Sunni Triangle? Does the majority of the
Sunni population begin to ""see the light"" and start to cooperate with the coalition and participate in rebuilding the
country?
It will be the new year before answers to some of these critical questions are apparent and give some indication
whether this new campaign is working, but for now that campaign is clearly underway.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,82,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915
"Goodpaster, Andrew",1981,1,2003-12-11,1,0,1,NYT,Army,,,M,"George Marshall's World, and Ours","At the end of his speech, with characteristic humility, Marshall revealed his fear that his words had failed him. ''Due to my inability to express myself with the power and penetration of the great Churchill, I have not made clear the points that assume such prominence and importance in my mind,'' he said. He needn't have feared. His ideas helped shape the world we live in and, 50 years later, can still mold the future -- if only we are willing to listen.","In early December 1953, Gen. George C. Marshall was en route to Oslo to receive the Nobel
Peace Prize for his role in reconstructing Europe. The five-day passage aboard the Andrea Doria was a rough
one, and the general had a terrible cold. Marshall had intended to use the voyage to draft his acceptance speech,
but his illness prevented him from doing so. He landed in Europe with a few central ideas in his head but nothing
on paper.
When he arrived at the residence of the supreme allied commander of Europe for NATO, Marshall asked for help
with his speech. I was then serving as an assistant at NATO headquarters, working on policy and strategy issues,
and was soon dispatched to his bedroom. (Actually it was the room of Gen. Alfred B. Gruenther, who was then
supreme allied commander.)
In the room was a bedridden Marshall, his slate-blue eyes and tight smile unaffected by the cold in his head. He
had jotted down a few thoughts on some note cards; we met for 45 minutes and I emerged with a rough outline. I
had never seen the general so tired.
I knew his thinking, however, having worked with him previously, and by our third meeting his health had
improved greatly -- and his speech was all but finished. That address, delivered 50 years ago today in Marshall's
terse, no-nonsense style, outlined a vision for the nation, and the world, that remains relevant. It can serve as an
instructive and helpful guide as America and the world examine the United States' efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Like Marshall himself, the speech was straightforward, even blunt, and what it lacked in eloquence it made up for
in clarity. Although I was unable to travel to Oslo to see him deliver it -- by that time I had been assigned other
duties at headquarters -- I was keenly aware of the goodwill it engendered.
Never one to shy from controversy, early in the speech Marshall addressed the issue of awarding the Nobel
Peace Prize to a soldier, which had generated some comment in the press. ''I know a great deal of the horrors
and tragedies of war,'' he said, noting that he was chairman of the commission that supervised the construction of
American military cemeteries overseas. ''The cost of war in human lives is constantly spread before me, written
neatly in many ledgers whose columns are gravestones.''
Military strength was essential to winning World War II, Marshall knew, and in keeping order afterward. But he
also knew that it alone could not bring peace. ''The maintenance of peace in the present hazardous world
situation does depend in very large measure on military power, together with allied cohesion,'' he said in Oslo.
''But the maintenance of large armies for an indefinite period is not a practical or a promising basis for policy. We
must stand together strongly for these present years . . . but we must, I repeat, must find another solution.''
The basis for that solution had been laid a decade earlier. In 1943, with much of the war still to be fought and
won, Marshall set up a civil affairs division of the Army, which was charged with planning and preparing for
occupation. The idea was drawn from his experience with Gen. John Pershing in Europe and with occupation
after World War I. Marshall was Pershing's aide-de-camp in that war, and he saw firsthand what happens when
conquering nations abandon war-ravaged countries.
His proposed solution, of course, was the Marshall Plan, outlined in another famous speech five-and-a-half years
earlier, when Marshall was secretary of state. Surveying the European landscape of privation, need and unrest,
he saw that a viable foreign policy for the United States required coordinated collective action. Peace and
Page 83 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
security, economic prosperity and stable democracy were interdependent. In this situation, the recovery of Europe
was of vital importance. It was for this vision of collective action toward a common goal and shared purpose that
he received the Nobel Prize.
Marshall was an avid amateur historian and an admirer of General Robert E. Lee, who said, ''It is history that
teaches us to hope.'' Yet he was also suspicious of history. He preferred to rest his arguments on unchanging
principles, not on shifting historical interpretations.
''There are innumerable instructive lessons out of the past, but all too frequently, their presentation is highly
colored or distorted in the effort to present a favorable national point of view,'' Marshall said in Oslo. ''I am certain
that a solution of the general problem of peace must rest on broad and basic understanding on the part of free
peoples.''
''Tyranny inevitably must retire before the tremendous moral strength of the gospel of freedom and self-respect
for the individual,'' he said. ''But we have to recognize that these democratic principles do not flourish on empty
stomachs and that people turn to false promises of dictators because they are hopeless and anything promises
something better than the miserable existence that they endure.''
The true heart and genius of the Marshall Plan was that it gave the people of Europe hope, restored their pride
and delivered on the promise of something better. It proposed that the countries of Europe, acting in concert,
should tell the United States what they deemed best to meet their needs -- not the other way around. In the
discussions of the European Recovery Program, with a representative of West Germany at the table, the United
States involved the European community rather than simply imposing its own ideas at the outset.
The challenge of the United States and its allies today is restoring prosperity, security and order in Iraq and
Afghanistan. The factors, in both the short and long term, are many and complex: the realities of day-to-day life,
the demands of cultures rooted in history, the ability (or lack thereof) of governments to provide basic services,
and the varying interests of other countries. American and other leaders should learn from Marshall's experience
and shift from the role of occupation to one of collaboration. Only with the active, collective participation of Iraqis
themselves will their country build economic viability and democratic governance.
Despite Congressional approval of the administration's aid package for Iraq and Afghanistan, President Bush still
has much work to do to convince the public of the importance of rebuilding Iraq. He should spare no opportunity
to make his case, and should consider greater involvement of the United Nations in the reconstruction. But
prolonged and inconclusive debate could lead to more distress and instability for the Iraqi people. ''As doctors
deliberate, patients are sinking,'' Marshall once said.
A commitment to building democratic institutions and economic prosperity is now more important than ever. The
$87 billion that Congress approved, with $20 billion to be spent on rebuilding Iraq, may prove to be just a down
payment for the peace and prosperity in the region that must be our enduring aim. As Marshall well understood,
judicious economic aid and mutual defense commitments serve both humanitarian and national interests.
At the end of his speech, with characteristic humility, Marshall revealed his fear that his words had failed him.
''Due to my inability to express myself with the power and penetration of the great Churchill, I have not made clear
the points that assume such prominence and importance in my mind,'' he said. He needn't have feared. His ideas

Our troops in the field think they are winning. So do Sgt. Mohammed, Pvt. Ahmed and Pvt. Raal. From what I've seen, I believe them.","The mean streets of Sadr City in Baghdad are some of the worst in Iraq. Even Saddam Hussein's dread security
forces feared to go there. But there's a new authority in town. As the Jaguar Platoon of the Fifth Battalion, Iraqi
Civil Defense Corps (ICDC), patrols cautiously down a side street, its soldiers move with confidence. They
should; after all, this is home. Kids wave and young men, some brothers and cousins of the soldiers, chat briefly
with the troops. Every patrol also doubles as a recruiting trip.
The Iraqi Civil Defense Corps is something between a constabulary counterguerrilla force and a national guard. In
its six month of existence, it has grown into the nation's most respected security service, far outperforming the
struggling police and the still tiny New Iraqi Army, now renamed the Iraqi Armed Forces. It has about 20,000
personnel and is growing fast.
Jaguar Platoon was locally recruited and trained, along with the rest of the 5th Battalion, by the U.S. Second
Armored Cavalry Regiment. Almost all of its 45 soldiers are Shiites from Sadr City. Pvt. Raal, who is scanning a
side street as a flank guard, lives about a mile away and knows many of the families along the route; his former
high school is around the corner. As the last of the platoon clears the intersection, Raal sprints to the head of the
column, deftly leaping over a stray sheep that has wandered away from its herd as it is being driven to market.
Jaguar Platoon is in its last week of training, which in all consists of a week of pre-boot camp, a week of boot
camp at Camp Muleskinner several miles away and two more weeks of practical instruction. This live patrol is one
of the final events on the fourth-week training schedule. Next week, the platoon will begin on-the-job training on
these same streets under the tutelage of two American trainers, an officer and a staff sergeant, who have been
mentoring them for the past few weeks. They also have an Iraqi interpreter and a U.S. Army civil affairs specialist
who has been assigned to this mission to talk to the two local sheiks whose neighborhood we traverse. The
specialist inquires about local needs and potential civic improvement projects.
The platoon's members went through boot camp together and the platoon leader was selected from the ranks,
Israeli style, for his leadership ability. He happens to be a former officer in the old army, but that alone did not
help him achieve his rank. This is an army where, perhaps for the first time in Iraqi history, leadership skill and
hard work mean promotion. There is no influence-peddling here. Col. Brad May, commander of the Second
Armored Cavalry, and I are along for the patrol, which has more the feel of a stroll in Manhattan than a trip
through one of the toughest neighborhoods in Iraq.
Pvt. Raal is asked why the ICDC is accepted in Sadr City, where Saddam Hussein's soldiers and police were
detested. His answer is simple: ""We are their soldiers."" Several days later, at a checkpoint in a Sunni
neighborhood, Pvt. Ahmed and Sgt. Mohammed are enjoying a few moments of off time. This neighborhood is
not as friendly. Mohammed explains that the people are hostile when they patrol with the Americans. ""They will
respect us more when we can patrol alone, without the Americans,"" Ahmed says. They also complain that the flak
jackets they wear are inferior to the plated ones worn by the Americans. (New flak jackets are on the way).
The next day, a few miles to the northwest, at a U.S. Army camp on a bend in the Tigris, I'm with the 36th
Battalion of the ICDC. This unit is unique. It is the strike force of the ICDC. Unlike the regular battalions, which are
generally composed of members of a single ethnic group from one sector of the city, the 36th is made up of a mix
of fighters from the militias of the parties that opposed Hussein. Mentored by U.S. Special Operations troops, they
gather information that Americans could never get and act on it once action is approved by the unit that they are
attached to. The battalion commander is a Sunni from the Iraqi National Congress. The executive officer is Shiite,
Page 87 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
and two company commanders are Kurds. In the short month of its existence, the battalion has achieved some
remarkable successes, including foiling two plots involving attacks on the headquarters of the Coalition
Provisional Authority.
Since I've returned from Iraq, several people have asked me if we can win. Our troops in the field think they are
winning. So do Sgt. Mohammed, Pvt. Ahmed and Pvt. Raal. From what I've seen, I believe them.",6,Support,,,,,,,75,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915

He has not cherry-picked bases in battleground states that he has said he would protect. ,"Today's debate: Defense spending
Opposing view: Military requirements should determine base closures.
America is at war. And the next president will inherit enormous responsibilities to keep America safe and win the
war on terror. He will face key decisions on the size of America's military and how best to rebalance the roles of the
active and reserve components.
John Kerry says his administration would conduct a review of the country's force-structure needs before appointing
a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission. His common-sense position reflects the fact that military
requirements -- not ideology, foregone conclusions or the momentum of past decisions -- must drive the baseclosure
process.
The Department of Defense shrouds the BRAC process in secrecy to protect it from interference before the
secretary of Defense submits his recommendations to the BRAC commission. While the Bush administration is
preparing the process, it is potentially a Kerry administration that will bear the responsibility for closing or realigning
bases in a time of war.
The law authorizing the 2005 BRAC round takes these considerations into account and provides the new president
with a window between January and March in which to review and, if necessary, revise the force-structure plan on
which BRAC is based. It also allows him to terminate the process altogether if, in his judgment, the process is
flawed or unwarranted.
There is good reason to proceed with caution. The Bush administration continues to develop a global-basing
posture, which may result in 50,000 troops returning to U.S. bases from overseas. Kerry has called for 40,000 new
troops in the active-duty Army. Any new president would want to review the impact of these decisions on domestic
bases before proceeding.
Let us be clear: Kerry voted for BRAC and understands it's a necessary tool to eliminate facilities we no longer
need and thus free up resources to further modernize our military. He has not cherry-picked bases in battleground
states that he has said he would protect. He has made legitimate observations about the process and said he'd
trust the counsel of his own secretary of Defense -- just as the law envisions.

I believe those who didn't serve, or didn't show up for service, should have the decency to respect those who did serve -- often under the most dangerous conditions, with bravery and, yes, with undeniable patriotism.","When John Kerry released his military records to the public last week, Americans learned a
lot about Mr. Kerry's exceptional service in Vietnam. They also learned a lot about the Republican attack
machine.
The evaluations were uniformly glowing. One commander wrote that Mr. Kerry ranked among ''the top few'' in
three categories: initiative, cooperation and personal behavior. Another commander wrote, ''In a combat
environment often requiring independent, decisive action, Lt. j.g. Kerry was unsurpassed.'' The citation for Mr.
Kerry's Bronze Star praises his ''calmness, professionalism and great personal courage under fire.''
In the United States military, there's no ideology -- there are no labels, Republican or Democrat -- when superiors
evaluate a man or woman's service to country. Mr. Kerry's commander for a brief time, Grant Hibbard, now a
Republican, gave Mr. Kerry top marks 36 years ago.
Now the standards are those of politics, not the military. Despite his positive evaluations, Mr. Hibbard recently
questioned whether Mr. Kerry deserved one of his three Purple Hearts.
In the heat of a political campaign, attacks come from all directions. That's why John Kerry's military records are
so compelling; they measure the man before his critics or his supporters saw him through a political lens. These
military records show that John Kerry served his country with valor, and that those who served with him and
above him held him in high regard. That's honor enough for any veteran.
Yet the Republican attack machine follows a pattern we've seen before, whether the target is Senator John
McCain in South Carolina in 2000 or Senator Max Cleland in Georgia in 2002. The latest manifestation of these
tactics is the controversy over Mr. Kerry's medals.
John Kerry was awarded three Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star and a Silver Star for his service in Vietnam. In April
1971, as part of a protest against the war, he threw some ribbons over the fence of the United States Capitol.
Republicans have tried to use this event to question his patriotism and his truthfulness, claiming he has been
inconsistent in saying whether he threw away his medals or ribbons. This is no more than a political smear. After
risking his life in Vietnam to save others, John Kerry earned the right to speak out against a war he believed was
wrong. Make no mistake: it is that bravery these Republicans are now attacking.
Although President Bush has not engaged personally in such accusations, he has done nothing to stop others
from making them. I believe those who didn't serve, or didn't show up for service, should have the decency to

election.
In the face of growing evidence that the president was deceived and misguided about the cause and urgency for
waging war on Saddam Hussein, it is time for those responsible to stand forth and accept accountability. True, the
president is ultimately responsible for the actions of his vice president, his Cabinet and the executive
departments. But it has become clear that the counsel the president received from the vice president, secretary of
defense, deputy secretary of defense and senior uniformed leadership was severely flawed and uncorroborated.
Whether the president was intentionally misled by neoconservatives or whether their advice was a result of pure
incompetence remains to be seen. The fact is that he was misled sufficiently to require him to take bold action to
restore his diminished credibility.
The supposedly urgent need to attack Iraq was based partly on inflated, creative intelligence information, some of
which originated with Ahmed Chalabi, an associate of the vice president and deputy secretary of defense. The
information from Chalabi led the vice president and defense secretary to believe that war with Iraq would be a
""cakewalk"" and U.S. forces would be received with open arms. This belief resulted in a fatal flaw in developing a
complete war strategy. A principal tenet of forming a strategy -- have a ""war termination"" phase -- was neglected.
Although the tactical and operational phases of the war were conducted flawlessly by superior field commanders,
the absence of a complete strategy has needlessly cost lives.
Our service members are the ultimate victims of this incomplete strategy, misguided policy and false intelligence.
It is inconceivable and derelict not to have a viable war termination strategy for an operation as complex as a
major theater war. America's citizens and our service members deserve far better for their sacrifices. This
combination of things -- misleading the president with false intelligence and omitting a principal element from our
war strategy -- is reason enough to seek change in the vice presidency and senior defense leadership, civilian
and military.
It is our patriotic duty to speak out when egregiously flawed policies and strategies needlessly cost American
lives. It is time for the president to ask those responsible for the flawed Iraqi policy -- civilian and military -- to
resign from public service. Absent such a change in the current administration, many of us will be forced to

More broadly, the so-called intelligence ""community"" -- structurally dysfunctional and lacking effective oversight --
essentially failed in its analyses of the two salient threats of the late 20th century: the Soviet Union and radical
Islam. The Sept. 11 commission's proposed overhaul would go far toward restoring its effectiveness.
At present, the six peer agencies (CIA, DIA, NSA, INR, FBI and National Reconnaissance Office) are dominated
by one -- the CIA. Since all intelligence is filtered through the CIA, this creates an inevitable bias in what is
presented to the president and diminishes the prospect that sound, though differing, judgments will be heard. The
goal of the commission's recommendations is to make the bureaucracy functional by removing it from the control
of one of its members and relying on the new national intelligence director's staff to oversee the production of
objective, integrated intelligence.
I see no reason for concern that this restructuring could distance the president even further from dissenting
intelligence voices. It would be far less threatening for a lone dissenter to approach the president's staff directly
than to have to risk first going through a CIA filter to make his or her point.
In addition, as it would be unfettered by agency loyalty and bias, the new staff could have a dramatic impact on
what I call ""inertial budgeting"" -- the practice of funding systems and programs this year because we did it last
year -- and instead could make it possible to focus resources on new priorities or to exploit new technologies in a
more timely way.
The military's unified command structure, which has proven so effective in bringing the four uniformed services
into a cooperative working relationship, is a sound model for the new director's office. A superior NID staff could
be created by careful recruiting of experienced professionals from within and outside government. And giving staff
members separate career status would insulate them against special pleading from their former ""parent"" agency.
Giving the new director a fixed term that overlaps administrations, as suggested by some in Congress, is the right
way to go to avoid the post's becoming politicized. The challenge lies in selecting a nonpartisan, experienced
individual, but there's a solid cohort of candidates to choose from, including such professionals as John Lehman,
9/11 commission member and former Navy secretary; Marine Gen. Jim Jones, NATO's top military commander;
retired Adm. Dennis Blair, former commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific; Jim Woolsey, former director of
central intelligence; and former ambassador David Miller, to name a few.
Do I think that this arrangement risks placing more power over intelligence gathering in the national intelligence
director's hands than in the president's? No. Clearly, the director would receive tasking from -- and be
accountable to -- the president.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,75,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915

He characterized such activity as reckless and destructive on the part of the politicians and the officers, supposedly calling into question the political impartiality of our armed forces. By openly participating in the political process of selecting presidential candidates, he asserts, retired generals and admirals ""diminish American politics, and damage the national defense.""

When Colin Powell openly campaigned for Bob Dole and four years later did the same for George W. Bush, I wonder if he realized that he was diminishing American politics and damaging the national defense? When Gen. Charles Krulak, the then recently retired Commandant of the Marine Corps, and a large number of other retired flag officers openly endorsed George W. Bush, did they understand that they, too, were diminishing American politics and damaging the national defense?

They, and those who joined me in Boston in endorsing John Kerry, are true modern-day patriots and, at one time or another while on active duty, have laid their lives on the line in defense of America's interests. I doubt they need a lecture on their responsibilities to keep America safe.

There is no debate on the wisdom of such a political ""vow of silence"" on the part of our military.

In fact, there was a time when staying out of politics meant that officers shouldn't vote. The act of voting implied preference for one political party or another, and this called into question the apolitical position of an officer. In time, it was seen that officers could remain politically impartial in the execution of their duties despite having voted for one party or another. Officers have been voting now for well over half a century and, to all outside appearances, our military is no more politicized today than ever in its history.

For a number of years now, retired senior military leaders have been endorsing political parties as well as specific candidates. As a rule, they have gone out of their way to be responsible in their endorsements and have spoken as individuals, rather than for the military institution. In turn, the candidates they have endorsed have never attempted to ""buy"" or ""reward"" such support.

Mr. Cohen is correct that, as long as an individual wears the uniform of the U.S. military, he or she must never cross the line into the political world. In that regard military leaders must remain ""purer than Caesar's wife.""

Mr. Cohen is wrong, however, when he asserts that generals never retire. Generals do retire. When they do, they share the same responsibility as Mr. Cohen and the rest of America to participate responsibly in the political process.

Bush has his eye on that ball and Senator John Kerry does not. ,"President Bush and Senator John Kerry have very different views of the war on terrorism, and those differences
ought to be debated in this presidential campaign. But the debate should focus on facts, not distortions of history.
On more than one occasion, Senator Kerry has referred to the fight at Tora Bora in Afghanistan during late 2001
as a missed opportunity for America. He claims that our forces had Osama bin Laden cornered and allowed him
to escape. How did it happen? According to Mr. Kerry, we ''outsourced'' the job to Afghan warlords. As
commander of the allied forces in the Middle East, I was responsible for the operation at Tora Bora, and I can tell
you that the senator's understanding of events doesn't square with reality.
First, take Mr. Kerry's contention that we ''had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden'' and that ''we
had him surrounded.'' We don't know to this day whether Mr. bin Laden was at Tora Bora in December 2001.
Some intelligence sources said he was; others indicated he was in Pakistan at the time; still others suggested he
was in Kashmir. Tora Bora was teeming with Taliban and Qaeda operatives, many of whom were killed or
captured, but Mr. bin Laden was never within our grasp.
Second, we did not ''outsource'' military action. We did rely heavily on Afghans because they knew Tora Bora, a
mountainous, geographically difficult region on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is where Afghan
mujahedeen holed up for years, keeping alive their resistance to the Soviet Union. Killing and capturing Taliban
and Qaeda fighters was best done by the Afghan fighters who already knew the caves and tunnels.
Third, the Afghans weren't left to do the job alone. Special forces from the United States and several other
countries were there, providing tactical leadership and calling in air strikes. Pakistani troops also provided
significant help -- as many as 100,000 sealed the border and rounded up hundreds of Qaeda and Taliban
fighters.
Contrary to Senator Kerry, President Bush never ''took his eye off the ball'' when it came to Osama bin Laden.
The war on terrorism has a global focus. It cannot be divided into separate and unrelated wars, one in
Afghanistan and another in Iraq. Both are part of the same effort to capture and kill terrorists before they are able
to strike America again, potentially with weapons of mass destruction. Terrorist cells are operating in some 60
countries, and the United States, in coordination with dozens of allies, is waging this war on many fronts.
As we planned for potential military action in Iraq and conducted counterterrorist operations in several other
countries in the region, Afghanistan remained a center of focus. Neither attention nor manpower was diverted
from Afghanistan to Iraq. When we started Operation Iraqi Freedom we had about 9,500 troops in Afghanistan,
and by the time we finished major combat operations in Iraq last May we had more than 10,000 troops in
Afghanistan.
We are committed to winning this war on all fronts, and we are making impressive gains. Afghanistan has held
the first free elections in its history. Iraq is led by a free government made up of its own citizens. By the end of this
year, NATO and American forces will have trained 125,000 Iraqis to enforce the law, fight insurgents and secure
the borders. This is in addition to the great humanitarian progress already achieved in Iraq.
Many hurdles remain, of course. But the gravest danger would result from the withdrawal of American troops
before we finish our work. Today we are asking our servicemen and women to do more, in more places, than we
have in decades. They deserve honest, consistent, no-spin leadership that respects them, their families and their

sacrifices. The war against terrorism is the right war at the right time for the right reasons. And Iraq is one of the

not.",10,Warfighting,,,,1,,Defense of President George W. Bush ,75,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915

election in my memory. America is at war on a scale unmatched in scope and importance since World War II. The
threat today isn't monolithic like Hitler's Germany or Hirohito's Japan -- or bin Laden's al Qaeda of the '90s. But it's
just as deadly, with diverse cells in 60 countries, linked by ideology and hatred. The war is global, complex and
lethal, and the fundamental choice we must make is whether we fight that war offensively, by pursing the
terrorists relentlessly around the world, or defensively, by waiting for them to strike again on American soil.
There's no third choice. We cannot play for a tie. America did not create terrorism, terrorists did. And now we
must wage war until we win -- no half measures, no equivocation, no ""global test.""
John Kerry recently suggested that he'd be satisfied if terrorism were rolled back to the point where it was a
""nuisance."" Terrorism was never merely a nuisance. Terrorists have been killing Americans for more than two
decades. The problem is that we chose to do something about it only in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
The bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983; the first World Trade Center attack in 1993; the killing of
our airmen at Khobar Towers in 1996; the bombings of our embassies in East Africa in 1998; and the attack on
the USS Cole in 2000 -- these were not a ""nuisance."" They were deadly acts of war. The president of the United
States must recognize the difference.
I know from firsthand experience that George W. Bush understands this reality. As commander of the Allied
Forces in the Middle East, I worked with him as we laid out a strategy and reviewed operations. I came away from
every meeting, every conversation, impressed by his consistency, his honesty, and his character. He does not
hesitate, but neither does he rush to judgment. His decisions are based on the best information available. He
respects the military and trusts the judgments of our serving military leaders. At each step of planning, he asked
me directly whether I had the resources I needed to accomplish each mission. Yet his desire for thoroughness
never led to wavering. I knew I could count on him to have the steadiness and patience to see the mission
through -- and so did my subordinate commanders.
President Bush's leadership has come under attack by Sen. Kerry, who accuses the president of ""incompetence""
in pursuing the war on terror. With the release of the latest Osama bin Laden tape, Sen. Kerry has once again
attempted to capitalize on Americans' most urgent security concerns. The notion that we ""outsourced"" our mission
at Tora Bora is completely wrong. The Afghan forces at Tora Bora were working in concert with the best fighting
forces America has to offer. In addition, the Afghan troops had a long history of opposing the Taliban and fighting
for freedom in their own country.
This past week we also saw Sen. Kerry pounce on news stories about the Al Qaqaa facility in Iraq. Those stories
first said 380 tons of high explosives were missing, presumed taken after our soldiers were on the scene. Now it
turns out the story is more complicated. We don't know how many munitions were stored there when the war
began. And we don't know when the munitions that are gone were taken. What we do know is that our forces
have seized or destroyed more than 400,000 tons of munitions and explosives -- weapons that Saddam Hussein
controlled. If Sen. Kerry's view had prevailed, we wouldn't be arguing about 380 tons of munitions; Saddam would
still be in control of all 400,000 -- and potentially much more.
We still need to gather more information about the missing munitions. And, true to form, President Bush will
gather the facts and respond appropriately. I respect his thoughtfulness, and his willingness to work with our
generals to develop strategy -- strategy based on analysis and experience, not media headlines. All due respect
to the media, that's not the way to win a war.

I don't know Sen. Kerry's plan for victory. But I do know that his criticism of the military conduct of our global war
on terrorism disrespects our troops. I also know that he cannot lead troops to victory in a war when he's made it
perfectly clear that he doesn't support the cause. And he cannot attract more international support for this cause
when he denigrates the allies who are helping us.
President Bush understands that destroying terrorism requires a consistent, committed effort on a global scale.
And he knows we need the help of other nations committed to freedom. Since Sept. 11, 2001, he has built the
largest coalition in history. And the mission determined the coalition; the coalition did not determine the mission.
With the help of these allies, we have made remarkable progress in the last three years: 50 million people are
free, two regimes that sponsored terror are gone, and America is safer. But much remains to be done. As voters
consider their choice, they must think about how America will continue to confront challenges to our freedom.

to catch bin Laden, ""ignored"" warnings from our own officers about incorrect methodology, and that we also relied

2 general at CentCom in charge of the Afghanistan War, I can say with certainty that all of these allegations are

---
We strategized Tora Bora in essentially the same way we strategized the rest of the Afghanistan war: by using a
combination of our elite Special Forces and CIA Agents, embedded with native Afghan troops. We chose this
approach in waging the Afghan war for many reasons: it minimized the number of U.S. troops put in harm's way; it
drew on the strengths of the native Afghans who had been fighting in that terrain for years and who were adept at
traversing the mountainous terrain on horseback; and it helped avoid the same mistake the Soviets made in
Afghanistan. They had opted for a large troop presence and ended up with thousands of their troops killed.
The fact that we took Afghanistan in a matter of weeks -- a feat which tens of thousands of Soviet troops were
unable to accomplish in a matter of years -- proves that our strategy was exactly the right approach for
Afghanistan. This was essentially the same strategy we employed at Tora Bora. Thus, to say that we
""outsourced"" the job when we relied primarily on American Special Forces and American CIA agents is absurd.
This is especially the case in Tora Bora. I said ""essentially"" the same strategy because in Tora Bora we did shift
tactics. Instead of letting the Afghan warlords have command (as they had for the rest of the Afghan war), we put
U.S. Special Forces in command. These Special Forces conceived and executed the attack on Tora Bora, while
the Afghan warlords took orders from us. We never ""relied"" on them: we were 100% in charge. Few people
realize that Tora Bora began as a ground war, led by U.S. troops; bombing only followed later. Despite what
some have said, no caves were too deep for our reach. We bombed nonstop for three weeks. We received many
leads on bin Laden's whereabouts, and had U.S. troops rush in only to find dry holes.
The Knight Ridder reporters claim that we let 1,200 U.S. Marines sit idly by in an air base 80 miles away from
Tora Bora while the Afghans did the fighting for us. This is also not the case. Gen. Tommy Franks, working with
the Special Forces commander and consulting with the secretary of defense, all agreed that tactically it would be
best not to use those 1,200 troops. It was a deliberate decision, because using them would have meant killing
hundreds -- if not thousands -- of Afghan civilians, hostile to a heavy U.S. presence. A strong Afghan warlord
presence was essential. We could have sent more U.S. forces in and killed everybody -- but we may very well still
not have gotten bin Laden, and we would have definitely forever put the South at odds with us. Indeed, if we
pursued such a strategy, the ramifications would be so great that it is quite possible there would be no stable
Afghan government today.
The same holds true for the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan, where bin Laden likely escaped (if
indeed he was there to begin with). The Knight Ridder reporters claim that we relied on the Afghan warlords to
block the border for us. Again, this is incorrect. We relied on the Pakistani Frontier Forces -- once again, because
we had to. The U.S. could not go in to the border region with a heavier presence without sparking a war with the
locals; indeed, the regular Pakistani army could not even go in there without sparking a war. The border area had
to be blocked by Pakistani Frontier Forces if we didn't want to risk murdering thousands of civilians and making
Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf's position untenable with his people. Such actions would have meant
Page 97 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
losing a strong U.S. ally in Gen. Musharraf, an ally who has facilitated the killing or capturing of the largest
percentage of al Qaeda in the world since 9/11.
Finally, most people fail to realize that it is quite possible that bin Laden was never in Tora Bora to begin with.
There exists no concrete intel to prove that he was there at the time. Most importantly, capturing bin Laden was
not our No. 1 priority. Our mission was to topple the Taliban regime and rid Afghanistan of al Qaeda. If we caught
bin Laden it would have been a major plus -- but it was not our No. 1 objective.
One must remember that Tora Bora was a military operation and its execution was a tactical decision, which
means that it was never run by the president, and never should have been -- which makes this one less reason to
hold the president directly accountable on this issue. If anyone should be accountable, it should be us. And we
are more than satisfied with the way we handled the Afghan war -- including Tora Bora. If we had to do it again,
we'd do it exactly the same way.",10,DomesticPolicy,,,,1,,Endorsement of George W. Bush for President,75,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,29.3065918,32.3858915
"Marks, James",2004,1,2004-11-10,1,1,1,NYT,Army,,,M,"Rebels, Guns, and Money","One of the most difficult aspects of counterinsurgency operations is deciding when to declare victory and head on home, and it is far too early to even begin thinking about that. But with each American and Iraqi soldier that steps into Fallujah this week, we are that much closer to the end. ","The Marine and Army forces now entering Falluja, Iraq have prepared for this fight for some time, and not just since the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime last spring. Our military has a long history of training for and battling against unconventional enemies -- the Revolutionary War, the Indian wars, Vietnam and, in particular, a battle few American think much about: the invasion of Panama City in 1989.

In the effort to topple the corrupt government of Manuel Noriega, the American military pulled off one of the most complex and risky operations in the history of warfare. The elements were daunting: a diversity of urban and jungle terrain; a need to synchronize air power, airborne troops, light forces and special operations troops (some 23,000 Americans in all) on nearly 30 simultaneous missions; and a desire to keep civilian casualties and damage to a minimum. Yes, some things went wrong, and two dozen Americans were killed. But on the whole it was an overwhelming success.

That fight served to inform, teach and train a generation of leaders, many of whom are entering Falluja today. The young lieutenants, corporals and privates of 15 years ago are now battalion commanders and senior sergeants in Iraq. They carry with them the scar tissue of experience.

Urban fighting is grinding, destructive and deadly. When I entered Baghdad last year the city was without power, order or livestock. Dead horses rotted in the slums of Sadr City while looters, called ''couchpushers'' by the coalition troops, made off with everything. Nothing was without value; everything was pilfered. But other than a few isolated spots where there had been pitched battles, the city wasn't destroyed.

In Falluja things may be different. We will use precision weapons where there is a high probability of killing innocent Iraqis, but for the most part we will use conventional artillery, mortars and rockets. Buildings will crumple -- the train station demolished on Monday will not be the last -- because we will destroy them and so will the insurgents. Dust will be everywhere, small fires and smoke will obscure the vision of our troops and the enemy.

But it will not be as out of control as it may seem; the destruction will have a purpose. We will not do what the Russians did to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya: level the city and completely strip it of its form and shape. Our goal is to bring democracy and liberty to Iraq, and that won't happen if we destroy whole cities and towns. Fortunately, our soldiers have extensive training in urban operations down to the platoon and company level.

This training paid off last spring, when our Army and Marine Corps executed the largest urban maneuvers since World War II on their march northward to Baghdad. The most important lesson they learned was voiced to me by a soldier from the 507th Maintenance Company, who was taken prisoner when his unit was ambushed at Nasiriyah. After his rescue and return to American control he told me, ''there is no front line.'' The corollary is true as well: there is no rear. The enemy is everywhere and will fight everywhere. So must we.

What can we expect in the next few days? Unlike last year's invasion, in which the military's primary goal was to defeat the Iraqi troops and move toward Baghdad, the fight in Falluja is about taking terrain and holding it. It does no good to push the insurgents out and move on. They are like water; they will flow right back into any void.

This is why the military placed so much importance on taking the roads that lead into the city and securing a foothold. They will not be given back. Controlling access into and out of Falluja is key; with no escape possible, the enemy must surrender or die.

This is also why the military will likely launch a number of ''lillypad'' operations, in which forces move by ground or air into a contested area, kill insurgents and then return to a secure base to refuel and rearm. While this doesn't gain territory, it sends a psychologically devastating message: we will go where we want to go.

Firepower is important, but so is intelligence. In fact, the intelligence we gather in Falluja will dictate the pace and scope of the operation. The focus will be on ''human intelligence'' -- that is, soldiers and Marines will get information from Iraqi civilians and captured insurgents and use it to kill the bad guys or capture key leaders.

Why will ordinary Iraqis help? Many reasons, but the most effective tool in any counterinsurgency is money -- we will pay, and they will talk -- just as sources already have in places like Sadr City. In addition, the people want combat and its hell to go away, which will only happen when the insurgents are killed or captured.

The insurgents are surprisingly vulnerable, too -- in large measure because we can exploit the differences among them. Some are former Baathists, who believe they are fighting for their lives. Others are fighting for religious reasons, especially the foreign jihadists who came from across Asia to fight the satanic Americans. But many are fighting out of a sense of Iraqi pride, or simply to improve their political position in a post-war Iraq, and may thus be open to negotiation. As their situation deteriorates, so will their cohesiveness. There is a reason the operations are beginning now: it is because our top military and intelligence officials feel that conditions are right. As in Panama, we chose the timing of the fight, not the enemy.

After Falluja, what then? One of the goals in this fight is to gather more information on how the insurgents wage war and what their support systems are throughout the country. American units that are training in the United States today will absorb the lessons learned in Falluja into their training for their deployment in coming months. These troops will in turn conduct operations throughout the Sunni Triangle: Ramadi, Tikrit, Mosul. In the longer run, the counter-insurgency campaign will be defined by the breadth of its daily mission. Seemingly insignificant steps like seeing to it that medical teams provide inoculations to American engineers building roads or schools can be as important as military operations. Over time, the coalition will take away the insurgents' home court advantage and turn each city, town and stretch of road into a neutral playing field.

Thus it is vital that we have included several thousand Iraqi troops in the Falluja operation. The press may emphasize that the Iraqis do not have the skills and training to close on and kill the insurgents, and that the heavy lifting will be left to us. That's true, but the criticism misses the point. The Iraqis will be of great help in talking to the locals and gathering leads. And, in the longer run, their presence will give them the experience they will need to take over the security of their country when our troops come home.

And when will that day come? One of the most difficult aspects of counter-insurgency operations is deciding when to declare victory and head on home, and it is far too early to even begin thinking about that. But with each American and Iraqi soldier that steps into Falluja this week, we are that much closer to the end.",8,Warfighting,,,,,,,75,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,32.2203157,35.8318493
"McFarlane, Robert",,0,2004-12-20,1,1,1,WSJ,Marine Corps,,,M,A Declaration of Energy Independence,"In sum, it is entirely in American and Russian interest to encourage and facilitate a growing trade in LNG. Especially when one considers the alternative of remaining reliant on oil and gas from the Persian Gulf.","In the 30 years since the oil shocks of the 1970s, our original hopes to achieve energy independence have given way to the less ambitious goal of achieving energy security, defined as ""secure access to adequate supplies of primary energy at affordable cost.""

Recent expert analysis suggests, however, that we may have given up too soon and that while energy security may be the best we can hope for in the short term, within a generation we can be truly independent -- free of all reliance on foreign oil. Let's consider what will be required to get us through both periods successfully -- starting with the holy grail, energy independence.

Since the 9/11 attacks, two trends have emerged that seriously impact our ability to achieve energy security, let alone independence: the evident vulnerability of Persian Gulf regimes and the oil flows from them (not to mention the cost of providing security to the region), and the separate but related run-up in the price of oil. These trends have led Westerners to begin finally to think seriously about the need for a national energy policy. New ideas for tackling these problems are emerging on both the supply and demand side. And while we are far from consensus, it is already possible to see the contours of a comprehensive policy that will enable us to cope with the foregoing threats to our energy security on an affordable basis if we have the leadership and political will to do so.

Thus far supply-side proposals such as oil production in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge or developing natural gas offshore the lower 48 states have dominated the debate. These ideas are sound but they alone will not enable us to achieve energy independence.

Perhaps the most rigorous and surely the most dramatic analysis of what it will take to wean us from foreign oil was tasked by the Pentagon and carried out by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a respected center of hard-headed, market-based research. The report, ""Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profits, Jobs and Security"" (www.oilendgame.org.), is now out in book form and has received positive reviews.

In his forward to the book, George Shultz writes, ""How many more times must we be hit on the head by a two-by-four before we do something decisive about this acute problem? . . . Hybrid technology is already on the road and currently increases gas mileage by 50% or more. . . . New, ultralight-but-safe materials can nearly redouble fuel economy at little or no extra cost . . . hydrogen could be produced from natural gas saved from currently wasteful practices.""

The report outlines the steps to get us from here to zero reliance on foreign oil: First, to retool automobile, truck and aircraft manufacturing to reap fuel efficiencies by using advanced composite and lightweight steel construction. Such a metamorphosis could eliminate as much as 52% of the oil we use today by 2030 with no loss in safety or performance. Second, we should exploit recent advances in technologies for converting cellulose to ethanol and thereby replace another 25% of the oil we consume today. In the process we could increase farm income by tens of billions of dollars and create 750,000 jobs.

In the book's powerful summary conclusion, Dr. Amory Lovins, president of the Rocky Mountain Institute and the report's principal author, argues persuasively that by 2035 we can be entirely independent of imported oil and that ""it will cost less to displace all of the oil that the United States now uses than it will cost to buy that oil."" Specifically, he continues, ""by 2025, the annual economic benefit of displacing all of our current oil imports would be $130 billion gross (or $70 billion net of the displacement's cost). To achieve this does not require a revolution, but merely consolidating and accelerating trends already in place.""

But 2035 is not, of course, tomorrow. In order to improve our immediate energy security, we must diversify our sources of hydrocarbons away from the Middle East. Even a cursory survey of alternative sources of natural gas leads one to consider Russia.

First, a few facts. Today, measured in barrels of oil equivalent, Russia is the largest producer of energy in the world. It also has more natural gas than any other country in the world -- roughly 1,700 trillion cubic feet (proven recoverable). This gas is heavily concentrated on the North coast of Russia on the Yamal peninsula. And it is stranded. That is, there are no pipelines to get it to the market. These circumstances, however, make it an ideal site to anchor several so-called trains to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) for ship transport to North America.

Today, independent companies are producing gas in the Yamal peninsula for less than $1 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and there is solid evidence that it could be liquefied, shipped and delivered to North America for at least one-third less than the current price of over $6/mcf.

Some will say -- in the wake of the Yukos affair -- that the risk of politically motivated interference in Russia is too great for investments of the scale required. It takes little thought, however, to distinguish between an isolated confrontation driven by personal differences -- as the Yukos affair is -- and one driven by the huge Russian strategic interest in penetrating the U.S. gas market.

In sum, it is entirely in American and Russian interest to encourage and facilitate a growing trade in LNG. Especially when one considers the alternative of remaining reliant on oil and gas from the Persian Gulf.

Among the serious problems facing the new administration surely the long-term threat to our economy of $45/bbl oil and $6/mcf natural gas must be near the top. This threat is accentuated by the threat of disruption of deliveries from the Persian Gulf. It is becoming clear, however, that the means to achieving near-term energy security and ultimate independence from foreign oil are at hand. Courage and leadership are all that it takes to get us there.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,75,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,32.2203157,35.8318493
"Krohn, Charles",,1,2004-12-29,1,1,1,WaPO,Army,,,M,"In Iraq, Echoes of Another Offensive","The suspicion lingers that someone is whispering in the ears of the insurgent leadership that the American public will remember Tet '68 soon enough if there is sufficient violence as the elections approach, and if there are more suicide attacks than U.S. forces can readily suppress. They will assure each other that invalidating the elections is the tipping point and that the odds are in their favor.","Jan. 30 will mark Iraq's first elections on the road to democracy, provided all goes according to plan and
administration expectations. It will also mark the 37th anniversary of the turning point in another American war:
the Tet offensive of 1968. That was when Americans lost confidence in official pronouncements that the war in
Vietnam was winnable.
It must be coincidence that the election date was set for this anniversary. Yet those of us who have vivid
recollections of what it was like in and around Hue that year have reason to keep our fingers crossed, hoping that
there is indeed no parallel between the two dates.
In January 1968 I was serving with the 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry, ordered by the commander of the Army's 1st
Cavalry Division to relieve the Marines surrounded in Hue. It was a valiant but futile effort, and the battalion
casualty rate was more than 60 percent.
I wonder: Are the insurgents in Iraq students of history? Have they studied Ho Chi Minh's playbook? Are they
familiar with Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap's dream of cutting the country in two? Do they recall what happened on Jan.
30 -- the storming of our embassy and the attacks on virtually every provincial capital? Do they know it took 28
days to eject Giap's soldiers from Hue, the ancient -- and highly symbolic -- imperial capital? Are they aware that
protracted war goes against the grain of the American experience? Do they understand that the president's
encouraging words are effective, but only up to a point, given battlefield reversals and disappointment?
I support the war in Iraq because I believe its people deserve more breaks in life than they had under Saddam
Hussein. I also hope a democratic Iraq will influence regional politics. And, yes, I define democracy in very loose
and liberal terms at the moment. I know that we failed to find weapons of mass destruction, and perhaps there
was some manipulation of details in the buildup to the war. It doesn't matter now.
Regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction were found, the war we started off with in March 2003
doesn't exist anymore. We defeated Hussein. This war is more serious, because it pits us against a
fundamentalist Islamic insurgency that will keep growing if we fail. Insurgents will learn that murder works -- that
they are strong and the West is weak. Not all fundamentalists are murderers, but enough are to create a threat
that's hardly trivial.
I'm aware that nearly half of polled Americans think that going to war in Iraq was a mistake. The fact that early
reports of strategic success failed to materialize was a political depressant, especially among conservatives like
me who thought Rumsfeld was the ultimate realist. When he denied for so long that there was an insurgency, he
fractured his reputation permanently in some circles, discrediting himself and the president. The public at first
accepted his explanation that there were only ""dead-enders"" making mischief and that they'd soon run out of
steam. But after a few months people saw that the facts were otherwise, especially as casualties grew and the
ranks of the insurgents swelled. This trend continues.
Our apparent inability to control the insurgency is troubling. In South Vietnam there was a government we could
work with -- one that understood how to combat insurgency better than we outsiders did. That such a government
might coalesce only after the elections makes the success of the elections critically important. If they fail, the
options are few and stark.

The suspicion lingers that someone is whispering in the ears of the insurgent leadership that the American public
will remember Tet '68 soon enough if there is sufficient violence as the elections approach, and if there are more
suicide attacks than U.S. forces can readily suppress. They will assure each other that invalidating the elections is
the tipping point and that the odds are in their favor.
The gnawing question -- the one we cannot wish away -- is: Whose side is history on?",5,Warfighting,,,,,,,75,108,2003,0.793021562,0.650133578,32.2203157,35.8318493
"Clark, Wesley",2000,1,2005-02-01,1,0,1,WSJ,Army,,,M,Set Kosovo Free,"Unlike Iraq, there is today no active conflict in Kosovo. But prompt measures to resolve Kosovo's final status are warranted now, lest we lose both peace and freedom in the Balkans.","In his visionary inaugural address, President Bush talked about the challenges of promoting freedom abroad.
Naturally our attention has been focused on the elections in Iraq. But to focus exclusively on Iraq will raise
dangers elsewhere, such as in the Balkans. With each passing day, tensions in Kosovo grow, threatening to
destroy hard-won freedoms with renewed conflict. In 2005, the U.S. and the international community must
address the resolution of Kosovo's final status before it is too late to prevent tragedy.
Since NATO's intervention in 1999, Kosovo's final status has never been resolved. It is a U.N.-administered
province whose sovereignty still formally rests with Serbia and Montenegro. But after a decade of Belgrade's
oppression capped by war, mass expulsion and atrocities, Kosovo's 90% Albanian majority rejects completely any
renewed link with Serbia and will not settle for less than independence.
Nearly six years on, Serbs and Albanians still cannot live together. Serbia's avowed aim is to prevent Kosovo
from becoming independent. With conflict simmering, Kosovo's Albanian majority regards the Serb minority as a
fifth column, and neither side is ready for bridge-building. The puzzle of Kosovo is clearly not going to resolve
itself.
Tensions in Kosovo and Serbia are now on the rise again, and a violent collision may occur before year-end if not
headed off by a concerted Western effort. Further clashes, like the ones last spring, in which 20 people died and
another 800 were wounded, could result in an emergency partition of Kosovo's territory, creating a precedent
threatening to unravel U.S. and EU investments in stabilizing multi-ethnic states throughout the Balkans.
After the rioting of last March, some have questioned whether this fragile, volatile and underdeveloped society
either deserves or can sustain its own state. While these concerns are valid, it is important to remember that
Kosovo has already held two democratic elections and developed the foundations of a modern, functioning
economy. It has laid the basis for statehood. But the protection of minority rights cannot be assured without
progress in resolving final status. And this, of course, is the key issue.
Some in Serbia's political, security and media establishment have signally failed to move on from the Milosevic
era in their attitudes toward Kosovo, and a territorial carve-up takes higher priority in their maneuvering than the
welfare of the Serb minority on the ground.
They see advantage in further Albanian frustration and violence, and are making a sustained effort to provoke it in
order to force a partition solution that would hive off the Serb-inhabited northern municipalities of Kosovo and part
of the divided town of Mitrovica (a perennial flashpoint for violence), while jettisoning the two-thirds of Kosovo's
remaining Serbs who live farther south.
A relentless Serbian media campaign predicting new Albanian riots, saber-rattling over the Albanian-inhabited
Presevo Valley in south Serbia, and a southward redeployment of the Serbian army in December, may mark just
the opening salvoes in a strategy of provocation.
To head off the nightmare scenario of a Kosovo Albanian rebellion triggering all-out fighting over Mitrovica and a
Serbian army adventure to secure north Kosovo, a vigorous U.S.-led drive to resolve Kosovo's status has to begin
now.
The six-nation Contact Group (the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia) and the U.N. Security Council
have set mid-2005 as a date for deciding whether to begin a process to decide Kosovo's future status. Beginning
immediately, they should set the ground rules for negotiations and a timeline for a settlement. The framework for
Page 102 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Kosovo's future should be: no return to Belgrade rule; no partition of its territory; and no future union with Albania
or any neighboring territory. The pace at which Kosovo is allowed to progress toward full independence should be
made contingent on its treatment of minorities. This last point is absolutely critical.
The U.N. secretary general should also appoint a special envoy to begin consultations on a draft settlement text,
the ""Kosovo Accord,"" to include a new Kosovo constitution guaranteeing minority rights and continuing
international monitoring, assistance and security presences in a new Kosovo state.
---
Finally, an international conference should be organized in late 2005 to finalize and endorse the Kosovo Accord.
If Serbia cooperates, it will gain a role in shaping guarantees for Serbs in Kosovo's new constitution, to be drafted
by Kosovo's Assembly in agreement with the conference's international sponsors. But if Serbia boycotts the
process and refuses formally to relinquish sovereignty, Kosovo is in too fragile a condition to be kept hostage.
Similarly, should resolution of Kosovo's status be blocked in the Security Council, the U.S. should lead a coalition
of its European allies to organize the conference; endorse a Kosovo referendum for adoption of the new
constitution to go ahead in early 2006; and then give diplomatic recognition and sustained support to Kosovo as a
new state.
Unlike the case of Iraq, there is today no active conflict in Kosovo. But prompt measures to resolve Kosovo's final
status are warranted now, lest we lose both peace and freedom in the Balkans.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,74,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493

The U.S. and India should have the confidence and capability to take full advantage of this moment to move forward with a robust package of new strategic, political, economic and business ties.","America's relationship with India is at a crossroads, as U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice arrives in New
Delhi today. This represents a strategic opportunity for both countries. The U.S. and India should have the
confidence and capability to take full advantage of this moment to move forward with a robust package of new
strategic, political, economic and business ties.
On our visit to India last month as co-leaders of a U.S.-India Business Council group of American
defense-industry officials, we witnessed what can only be described as a sea change in Indian attitudes toward
cooperation with the U.S. There is broad recognition emerging throughout all levels of Indian government and the
business community of the distance that the U.S.-Indian relationship has traveled. The close cooperation on relief
operations that occurred in January between New Delhi and Washington following the disastrous tsunami in Asia
would not have been possible just a year ago. U.S. and Indian military forces train together in India and operate
jointly in the South Asia region, Washington and New Delhi share sensitive intelligence on mutual threats both
countries face in dealing with global and local terrorism.
Senior Indian government officials with whom we met emphasized a new willingness and desire to move forward
in the strategic relationship with the U.S. This new attitude manifested itself not only in the tone and tenor of our
meetings, but also in repeated requests for defense-industrial teaming relationships with American companies
and for closer cooperation with U.S. officials to better understand American procedures, rules and regulations.
The Indians understand they have a big government bureaucracy and demonstrated new willingness to open up
to the U.S.
Following India's test detonation of a nuclear weapon in May 1998, the U.S. introduced economic and trade
sanctions which brought most high-tech and defense trade between the two countries to a standstill. As a result,
India viewed U.S. companies as unreliable suppliers, because they could no longer guarantee the supply of spare
parts and technology upgrades for equipment India had already purchased. While the sanctions are behind us,
the issues of trust and confidence remain critical to both sides and will require significant improvement by both
governments for true U.S.-Indian defense-industrial partnerships to take hold.
India is the largest democracy in the world and holds foreign currency reserves of more than $130 billion. It wants
to spend a significant portion of this money and its regular defense budget on upgrading its older, outdated
Soviet-era military equipment. India recently made a request for information to support the possible purchase of
American fighter aircraft like the F-16 and F-18. If this request goes unapproved by the U.S. Government
licensing process, the Indians will likely buy French or Russian aircraft instead.
New Delhi wants to upgrade or replace many of its other current air and naval platforms and is looking for the
best product at the best price. Under the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership process, the U.S. has already
pledged to increase cooperation with India in the areas of missile defense, civilian space, civilian nuclear-energy
production, and high-technology trade. But, by considering the U.S. as a key provider of new military equipment
and upgrades, New Delhi is also telling Washington that it wants to more fully align itself with America.
India is focused on becoming a regional political, economic and military power, as a counterweight to growing
Chinese influence and as a check to Chinese ambitions. After China, India is the largest consumer of energy
resources in Asia. As competition for the world's supply of oil and gas heats up, India cannot afford to let China
outmaneuver it in energy dealings in the Middle East or Russia. This competition between India and China needs
to be managed properly because long-term peace, stability, and security in Asia is in everyone's best interests,
including those of the U.S.

In addition to Ms. Rice's current visit to India, a number of high-profile Indian government leaders are expected in
Washington this year. These visits will offer ample opportunities for U.S. administration officials and
Congressional lawmakers to take full measure of the new Indian attitude toward cooperation with America. Bold
and innovative thinking on both sides and the courage to get beyond some long-held mistrust holds promise of an
even more vibrant, rich, and mutually beneficial new relationship, and a true strategic partnership.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,74,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493

Yet none of the commissions or congressional committees investigating them has proposed more than platitudes about the FBI's reforming itself. Blistering criticism has been abundant, but not a single serious remedy has been demanded.","Of all the failures that allowed al Qaeda's attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, to succeed, those of the FBI are the most egregious. Yet none of the commissions or congressional committees investigating them has proposed more than platitudes about the FBI's reforming itself. Blistering criticism has been abundant, but not a single serious remedy has been demanded.

Meanwhile, evidence of the FBI's inability to reform continues to pile up. It has botched its expensive programs for acquiring state- of-the-art information technology systems. Its intelligence personnel still take a back seat to its crime-fighters. The FBI's expanded role abroad has been more disruptive than productive: Populating legal attache offices in U.S. embassies, usually with G- men, the bureau creates tensions with CIA stations and displays its incompetence to foreign counterpart agencies.

A few members of the commission on weapons of mass destruction belatedly seemed to realize that leaving counterintelligence responsibility within the FBI was not a good idea. But they would still leave it in the Justice Department, even if it were taken out of the FBI. That would be a fatal mistake. It cannot be effective there.

The problem is systemic. No one can turn a law enforcement agency into an effective intelligence agency. Police work and intelligence work don't mix. The skills and organizational incentives for each are antithetical. One might just as well expect baseball's Washington Nationals to win football's Super Bowl as believe the FBI can become competent at intelligence work.

Consider the different organizational incentives. FBI officials want arrests and convictions. They want media attention and lots of it. FBI operatives want to make arrests, to ""put the cuffs on"" wrongdoers. They have little patience for sustained surveillance of a suspect to gain more intelligence. They prefer to gamble on an early arrest and an intimidating interrogation that might gain a confession. To them, sharing intelligence is anathema. Intelligence is something to be used, not shared. Getting the credit is far more important than catching the spy or the terrorist.

Intelligence officials do not want public attention. They want to remain anonymous. They do not need arrest authority. They want to follow spies and terrorists secretly, allowing them to reveal their co-conspirators. Their reward comes from providing intelligence to others, not hiding it. They are quite happy to let the FBI make the arrests and take the credit.

There is, of course, an overlap between the two cultures: Gathering sufficient evidence to make an arrest and prove guilt is common to both. But counterintelligence agents tend to be more thorough, taking their time to develop evidence both for trials and for operational use. They know that they cannot let spies or terrorists get away without risking considerable danger to the country. Cops worry much less that a criminal will get away. Criminals are abundant and there are plenty more to arrest.

Spies and terrorists will almost always defeat police officers. Spies and terrorists are normally backed by large state bureaucracies or non-state organizations with abundant resources and worldwide operational support. Criminals seldom are. Thus FBI techniques of recruiting ""stoolies,"" tapping phones and conducting rough interrogations often work with mobsters but not with spies and terrorists.

In fact, if one looks closely at the FBI's record vis-a-vis Soviet intelligence operatives throughout J. Edgar Hoover's reign, it is saturated with disgraceful failures. The famous Venona file of decryptions of Soviet agents' communications during the 1940s yielded more than 200 names of U.S. citizens. Of those, the FBI was able (or willing) to follow and gain adequate evidence to support the conviction of only two: Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Scores of others duped the FBI completely.

The only hope for improvement is the creation of a separate agency, equal to the CIA and under the new director of national intelligence. Sometimes called the ""MI-5 solution,"" after the British example, it has been dismissed by members of Congress who say that the American public will not tolerate a ""domestic spy agency."" This is simply untrue. They have tolerated such an agency for decades -- the FBI -- and it is not known for respecting Americans' civil rights.

Congress celebrated passing the new intelligence reform law, pretending that it will ""fix"" the Sept. 11 problems. It will not. At the same time, Congress refused to do the single thing that could fix them: create a national counterintelligence service.",9,Warfighting,,,,,,,74,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493

Resolve isn't enough to mend a flawed approach -- or to save the lives of our troops. If the administration won't adopt a winning strategy, then the American people will be justified in demanding that it bring our troops home.","In the old, familiar fashion, mounting U.S. casualties in Iraq have mobilized increasing public doubts about the
war. More than half the American people now believe that the invasion of Iraq was a mistake. They're right. But it
would also be a mistake to pull out now, or to start pulling out or to set a date certain for pulling out. Instead we
need a strategy to create a stable, democratizing and peaceful state in Iraq -- a strategy the administration has
failed to develop and articulate.
From the outset of the U.S. post-invasion efforts, we needed a three-pronged strategy: diplomatic, political and
military. Iraq sits geographically on the fault line between Shiite and Sunni Islam; for the mission to succeed we
will have to be the catalyst for regional cooperation, not regional conflict.
Unfortunately, the administration didn't see the need for a diplomatic track, and its scattershot diplomacy in the
region -- threats, grandiose pronouncements and truncated communications -- has been ill-advised and
counterproductive. The U.S. diplomatic failure has magnified the difficulties facing the political and military
elements of strategy by contributing to the increasing infiltration of jihadists and the surprising resiliency of the
insurgency.
On the political track, aiming for a legitimate, democratic Iraqi government was essential, but the United States
was far too slow in mobilizing Iraqi political action. A wasted first year encouraged a rise in sectarian militias and
the emergence of strong fractionating forces. Months went by without a U.S. ambassador in Iraq, and today
political development among the Iraqis is hampered by the lack not only of security but also of a stable
infrastructure program that can reliably deliver gas, electricity and jobs.
Meanwhile, on the military track, security on the ground remains poor at best. U.S. armed forces still haven't
received resources, restructuring and guidance adequate for the magnitude of the task. Only in June, over two
years into the mission of training Iraqi forces, did the president announce such ""new steps"" as partnering with
Iraqi units, establishing ""transition teams"" to work with Iraqi units and training Iraqi ministries to conduct
antiterrorist operations. But there is nothing new about any of this; it is the same nation-building doctrine that we
used in Vietnam. Where are the thousands of trained linguists? Where are the flexible, well- resourced,
military-led infrastructure development programs to win ""hearts and minds?"" Where are the smart operations and
adequate numbers of forces -- U.S., coalition or Iraqi -- to strengthen control over the borders?
With each passing month the difficulties are compounded and the chances for a successful outcome are reduced.
Urgent modification of the strategy is required before it is too late to do anything other than simply withdraw our
forces.
Adding a diplomatic track to the strategy is a must. The United States should form a standing conference of Iraq's
neighbors, complete with committees dealing with all the regional economic and political issues, including trade,
travel, cross-border infrastructure projects and, of course, cutting off the infiltration of jihadists. The United States
should tone down its raw rhetoric and instead listen more carefully to the many voices within the region. In
addition, a public U.S. declaration forswearing permanent bases in Iraq would be a helpful step in engaging both
regional and Iraqi support as we implement our plans.
On the political side, the timeline for the agreements on the Constitution is less important than the substance of
the document. It is up to American leadership to help engineer, implement and sustain a compromise that will
avoid the ""red lines"" of the respective factions and leave in place a state that both we and Iraq's neighbors can

support. So no Kurdish vote on independence, a restricted role for Islam and limited autonomy in the south. And
no private militias.
In addition, the United States needs a legal mandate from the government to provide additional civil assistance
and advice, along with additional U.S. civilian personnel, to help strengthen the institutions of government. Key
ministries must be reinforced, provincial governments made functional, a system of justice established (and its
personnel trained) and the rule of law promoted at the local level. There will be a continuing need for assistance
in institutional development, leadership training and international monitoring for years to come, and all of this must
be made palatable to Iraqis concerned with their nation's sovereignty. Monies promised for reconstruction simply
must be committed and projects moved forward, especially in those areas along the border and where the
insurgency has the greatest potential.
On the military side, the vast effort underway to train an army must be matched by efforts to train police and local
justices. Canada, France and Germany should be engaged to assist. Neighboring states should also provide
observers and technical assistance. In military terms, striking at insurgents and terrorists is necessary but
insufficient. Military and security operations must return primarily to the tried-and-true methods of
counterinsurgency: winning the hearts and minds of the populace through civic action, small-scale economic
development and positive daily interactions. Ten thousand Arab Americans with full language proficiency should
be recruited to assist as interpreters. A better effort must be made to control jihadist infiltration into the country by
a combination of outposts, patrols and reaction forces reinforced by high technology. Over time U.S. forces
should be pulled back into reserve roles and phased out.

troops should stay in Iraq, I was able to see the issue through the eyes of America's friends in the Persian Gulf
region. The Arab states agree on one thing: Iran is emerging as the big winner of the American invasion, and both
President Bush's new strategy and the Democratic responses to it dangerously miss the point. It's a devastating
critique. And, unfortunately, it is correct.
While American troops have been fighting, and dying, against the Sunni rebels and foreign jihadists, the Shiite
clerics in Iraq have achieved fundamental political goals: capturing oil revenues, strengthening the role of Islam in
the state, and building up formidable militias that will defend their gains and advance their causes as the
Americans draw down and leave. Iraq's neighbors, then, see it evolving into a Shiite-dominated, Iranian buffer
state that will strengthen Tehran's power in the Persian Gulf just as it is seeks nuclear weapons and intensifies its
rhetoric against Israel.
The American approach shows little sense of Middle Eastern history and politics. As one prominent Kuwaiti
academic explained to me, in the Muslim world the best way to deal with your enemies has always been to
assimilate them -- you never succeed in killing them all, and by trying to do so you just make more enemies.
Instead, you must woo them to rejoin society and the government. Military pressure should be used in a
calibrated way, to help in the wooing.
If this critique is correct -- and it is difficult to argue against it -- then we must face its implications. ''Staying the
course'' risks a slow and costly departure of American forces with Iraq increasingly factionalized and aligned with
Iran. Yet a more rapid departure of American troops along a timeline, as some Democrats are calling for, simply
reduces our ability to affect the outcome and risks broader regional conflict.
We need to keep our troops in Iraq, but we need to modify the strategy far more drastically than anything
President Bush called for last week.
On the military side, American and Iraqi forces must take greater control of the country's borders, not only on the
Syrian side but also in the east, on the Iranian side. The current strategy of clearing areas near Syria of
insurgents and then posting Iraqi troops, backed up by mobile American units, has had success. But it needs to
be expanded, especially in the heavily Shiite regions in the southeast, where there has been continuing
cross-border traffic from Iran and where the loyalties of the Iraqi troops will be especially tested.
We need to deploy three or four American brigades, some 20,000 troops, with adequate aerial reconnaissance, to
provide training, supervision and backup along Iraq's several thousand miles of vulnerable border. And even then,
the borders won't be ''sealed''; they'll just be more challenging to penetrate.
We must also continue military efforts against insurgent strongholds and bases in the Sunni areas, in conjunction
with Iraqi forces. Over the next year or so, this will probably require four to six brigade combat teams, plus an
operational reserve, maybe 30,000 troops.
But these efforts must go hand-in-glove with intensified outreach to Iraqi insurgents, to seek their reassimilation
into society and their assistance in wiping out residual foreign jihadists. Iraqi and American officials have had
sporadic communications with insurgent leaders, but these must lead to deeper discussions on issues like
Page 111 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
amnesty for insurgents who lay down their arms and opportunities for their further participation in public and
private life.
Iraq, for its part, must begin to enforce the ban on armed militias that was enshrined in the new Constitution,
especially in the south. Ideally, this should be achieved voluntarily, through political means. But American muscle
will have to be made available as a last resort. The Iraqi government should request that for the next two years,
six to eight American brigades serve as a backup, available as a last resort if there is trouble in cities with large
militia factions like Baghdad, Basra and Najaf. And it is vital that the Pentagon provide our forces with better
crowd-control training and many more translators than they have now.
As important as these military changes are, they won't matter at all unless our political strategy is rethought. First,
the Iraqis must change the Constitution as quickly as possible after next week's parliamentary elections. Most
important, oil revenues should be declared the property of the central government, not the provinces. And the
federal concept must be modified to preclude the creation of a Shiite autonomous region in the south.
Also, a broad initiative to reduce sectarian influence within government institutions is long overdue. The elections,
in which Sunnis will participate, will help; but the government must do more to ensure that all ethnic and religious
groups are represented within ministries, police forces, the army, the judiciary and other overarching federal
institutions.
And we must start using America's diplomatic strength with Syria and Iran. The political weakness of Bashar
al-Assad opens the door for significant Syrian concessions on controlling the border and cutting support for the
jihadists. We also have to stop ignoring Tehran's meddling and begin a public dialogue on respecting Iraqi
independence, which will make it far easier to get international support against the Iranians if (and when) they
break their word.
Yes, our military forces are dangerously overstretched. Recruiting and retention are suffering; among retired
officers, there is deep concern that the Bush administration's attitude on the treatment of detainees has
jeopardized not only the safety of our troops but the moral purpose of our effort.
Still, none of this necessitates a pullout until the job is done. After the elections, we should be able to draw down
by 30,000 troops from the 160,000 now there. Don't bet against our troops.
What a disaster it would be if the real winner in Iraq turned out to be Iran, a country that supports terrorism and
opposes most of what we stand for. Surely, we can summon the wisdom, resources and bipartisan leadership to
change the American course before it is too late.",10,Warfighting,,1,,,,The author is criticizing George W. Bush's Iraq policy. ,74,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493
"Hansen, Victor",,1,2005-12-15,0,0,1,WaPO,Army,,,M,No Secret Rules on Torture,"In the extremely difficult and dangerous operational environment that exists in the global war on terrorism, the Army needs to be clear on this issue, and commanders and soldiers need to know that there is one set of legal rules governing their actions. If the Army establishes two sets of rules and keeps one secret, it will be setting up commanders and soldiers for failure.","It's reported that the Army is forwarding a classified addendum to the new Army Field Manual on interrogation
operations. According to these reports, the 10-page addendum provides dozens of examples of what procedures
may and may not be used by interrogators, and it informs commanders on the circumstances for their
employment.
This move amounts to an attempt by the Army to use the back door to establish secret interrogation techniques at
the same time the new Field Manual on interrogation operations is coming out (later this month). It sends exactly
the wrong message to the world and, more important, fosters the same kind of confusion and contradictory
policies that have contributed to the abuse of detainees in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.
Every official investigation that looked into the causes for detainee abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison noted that
there was confusion at all levels and, most importantly, among the interrogators as to what were appropriate and
legal methods of interrogation. This confusion was caused by the fact that many interrogators were
inexperienced, that many came from different operational areas, and that numerous different and unauthorized
versions of proper interrogation techniques were in circulation among the troops. Most significantly, the current
Army Field Manual provides little guidance on what are appropriate and legal interrogation techniques under U.S.
and international law.
The Army's move to draft a more specific Field Manual is an attempt to rectify these problems and provide clear
guidance that commanders and soldiers at all levels can understand and readily implement. It has the added
benefit of sending a message to our allies and enemies that in an open society, we value the rule of law and will
not train soldiers to violate human rights. An unequivocal message is essential to begin to repair the enormous
damage caused by the incidents of detainee abuse broadcast throughout the world.
An addendum to the Field Manual that details secret techniques and sets out secret rules for their employment
undermines this entire effort. A secret list such as this contradicts our efforts to demonstrate that we are an open
society governed by the rule of law and that the U.S. military respects human rights.
This secret document also creates the very confusion that commanders and soldiers faced at Abu Ghraib. The
message to soldiers and commanders will be that there is one set of rules on interrogation techniques for public
consumption and then there are the ""real rules."" This secret set of rules puts added pressure on commanders at
all levels to use the most aggressive interrogation techniques possible.
At the time the abuse occurred at Abu Ghraib, there were official and unofficial secret documents circulating
among soldiers at the prison giving varied and often contradictory guidance on interrogation techniques. In that
difficult operational environment it was impossible for solders to sort through the confusion and contradictions.
If the reported secret addendum becomes part of the Army Field Manual, we can expect the same confusion in
future operations. This is a time and an opportunity for the Army to set a clear, open policy on proper interrogation
operations and to train commanders and soldiers at all levels to one standard on how to legally and humanely
conduct interrogations. This is not a time to send a mixed message to our allies and enemies and sow seeds of

The real issue is that we are relying on commercial companies largely to police themselves. Both Congress and the White House should embrace a framework of ""trust, but verify"" in President Ronald Reagan's phrase, based on real standards and oversight. ","THE political firestorm surrounding the takeover of five American container terminals by Dubai Ports World, a
United Arab Emirates company, is a political distraction, but in many ways a welcome one. Americans are finally
taking port security seriously.
Ports are the on- and offramps to global markets, and they belong to a worldwide system operated by many
different private and public entities. Since the United States cannot own and control all of that system, we must
work with our trade partners and foreign companies to ensure its security. A major step in that direction would be to
construct a comprehensive global container inspection system that scans the contents of every single container
destined for America's waterfront before it leaves a port -- rather than scanning just the tiny percentage we do now.
This is not a pie-in-the-sky idea. Since January 2005, every container entering the truck gates of two of the world's
busiest container terminals, in Hong Kong, has passed through scanning and radiation detection devices. Images of
the containers' contents are then stored on computers so that they can be scrutinized by American or other
customs authorities almost in real time. Customs inspectors can then issue orders not to load a container that
worries them.
The Department of Homeland Security has greeted this private-sector initiative with only tepid interest. But the
Dubai deal provides an opportunity to adopt a system like the one in Hong Kong globally. Washington should
embrace Dubai Ports World's offer to provide additional guarantees to protect the five American terminals it wants
to run. The company should agree to install scanning and radiation detection equipment at the entry gates of its 41
terminals in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, North America and South America within the next two years.
By making this commitment, the company could address head-on the anxiety of American lawmakers, governors
and port city mayors that is fueling the uproar. The 45-day review period that has recently been agreed upon
provides the breathing room to work out the details. Congress and the White House should appropriate the
necessary funds to allay the concerns of the severely strained Customs and Border Protection agency, which,
burdened by old and frail information systems, may worry that it can't tap the revolutionary potential of such a
comprehensive inspection approach.
Hutchison Port Holdings, a Hong Kong-based company that is the world's largest container terminal operator,
would probably join Dubai Ports World in putting Hong Kong-style inspection systems in place within its 42 ports.
Page 2 of 4
A Port in the Storm Over Dubai - Correction Appended
Hutchison's chief executive, John Meredith, is an outspoken advocate for improving container security and has
championed the Hong Kong pilot program, which runs in one of its terminals.
Hutchison Port Holdings along with PSA Singapore Terminals, Dubai Ports World and Denmark's APM Terminals
handle nearly eight out of every 10 containers destined for the United States. If they agreed to impose a common
security fee of roughly $20 per container, similar to what passengers are now used to paying when they purchase
airline tickets, they could recover the cost of installing and operating this system worldwide. This, in turn, would
furnish a powerful deterrent for terrorists who might be tempted to convert the ubiquitous cargo container into a
poor man's missile.
There is already a bipartisan bill that the White House and Congress could embrace to advance this effort. The
GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security bill, co-sponsored by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Patty
Murray, Democrat of Washington, provides incentives for American importers to accept the modest fees associated
with a global container inspection system. The bill would also establish minimum security standards and
encourages the tracking and monitoring of containers throughout the supply chain.
Moreover, it would create joint operations centers within American ports to ensure that, should there be a terrorist
incident or a heightened level of threat, the ports will respond in a coordinated, measured way that will allow the
flow of commerce to resume when appropriate.
A global regime for container security will require oversight. Congress should require that the security plans
developed by importers be independently audited. It should also provide the Department of Homeland Security with
adequate Customs and Coast Guard inspectors to audit these auditors. Today Customs has only 80 inspectors to
monitor the compliance of the 5,800 importers who have vowed to secure their goods as they travel from factories
to ship terminals. To assess worldwide compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, the
Coast Guard has just 20 inspectors -- roughly the size of the average passenger screening team at an airport
security checkpoint.
Congress and the White House should step back from the brink of political fratricide over the Dubai deal. Certainly
it is necessary and appropriate to closely examine any transaction that involves a foreign government having an
ownership interest in critical United States assets. But the 45-day security review will provide a chance to work
through those issues.
At the end of the day, America's port security challenge is not about who is in charge of our waterfront. The real
issue is that we are relying on commercial companies largely to police themselves. Both Congress and the White
House should embrace a framework of ''trust but verify,'' in President Ronald Reagan's phrase, based on real
standards and real oversight. When it comes to the flow of goods around the planet, we need to know what's in the

"Eaton, Paul",2006,1,2006-03-19,0,0,1,NYT,Army,,,M,A Top-Down Review for the Pentagon,"By that rule, Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld is not competent to lead our armed forces. First, his failure to build coalitions with our allies from what he dismissively called ''old Europe'' has imposed far greater demands and risks on our soldiers in Iraq than necessary. Second, he alienated his allies in our own military, ignoring the advice of seasoned officers and denying subordinates any chance for input.","DURING World War II, American soldiers en route to Britain before D-Day were given a pamphlet on how to behave
while awaiting the invasion. The most important quote in it was this: ''It is impolite to criticize your host; it is militarily
stupid to criticize your allies.''
By that rule, Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld is not competent to lead our armed forces. First, his failure to
build coalitions with our allies from what he dismissively called ''old Europe'' has imposed far greater demands and
risks on our soldiers in Iraq than necessary. Second, he alienated his allies in our own military, ignoring the advice
of seasoned officers and denying subordinates any chance for input.
In sum, he has shown himself incompetent strategically, operationally and tactically, and is far more than anyone
else responsible for what has happened to our important mission in Iraq. Mr. Rumsfeld must step down.
In the five years Mr. Rumsfeld has presided over the Pentagon, I have seen a climate of groupthink become
dominant and a growing reluctance by experienced military men and civilians to challenge the notions of the senior
leadership.
I thought we had a glimmer of hope last November when Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, faced off with Mr. Rumsfeld on the question of how our soldiers should react if they witnessed illegal
treatment of prisoners by Iraqi authorities. (General Pace's view was that our soldiers should intervene, while Mr.
Rumsfeld's position was that they should simply report the incident to superiors.)
Unfortunately, the general subsequently backed down and supported the secretary's call to have the rules
clarified, giving the impression that our senior man in uniform is just as intimidated by Secretary Rumsfeld as was
his predecessor, Gen. Richard Myers.
Mr. Rumsfeld has put the Pentagon at the mercy of his ego, his cold warrior's view of the world and his unrealistic
confidence in technology to replace manpower. As a result, the Army finds itself severely undermanned -- cut to 10
active divisions but asked by the administration to support a foreign policy that requires at least 12 or 14.
Only Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff when President Bush was elected, had the courage to challenge
the downsizing plans. So Mr. Rumsfeld retaliated by naming General Shinseki's successor more than a year before
Page 2 of 4
A Top-Down Review for the Pentagon - Correction Appended
his scheduled retirement, effectively undercutting his authority. The rest of the senior brass got the message, and
nobody has complained since.
Now the Pentagon's new Quadrennial Defense Review shows that Mr. Rumsfeld also fails to understand the
nature of protracted counterinsurgency warfare in Iraq and the demands it places on ground forces. The document,
amazingly, does not call for enlarging the Army; rather, it increases only our Special Operations forces, by a token
15 percent, maybe 1,500 troops.
Mr. Rumsfeld has also failed in terms of operations in Iraq. He rejected the so-called Powell Doctrine of
overwhelming force and sent just enough tech-enhanced troops to complete what we called Phase III of the war --
ground combat against the uniformed Iraqis. He ignored competent advisers like Gen. Anthony Zinni and others
who predicted that the Iraqi Army and security forces might melt away after the state apparatus self-destructed,
leading to chaos.
It is all too clear that General Shinseki was right: several hundred thousand men would have made a big difference
then, as we began Phase IV, or country reconstruction. There was never a question that we would make quick work
of the Iraqi Army.
The true professional always looks to the ''What's next?'' phase. Unfortunately, the supreme commander, Gen.
Tommy Franks, either didn't heed that rule or succumbed to Secretary Rumsfeld's bullying. We won't know which
until some bright historian writes the true story of Mr. Rumsfeld and the generals he took to war, an Iraq version of
the Vietnam War classic ''Dereliction of Duty'' by H. R. McMaster.
Last, you don't expect a secretary of defense to be criticized for tactical ineptness. Normally, tactics are the
domain of the soldier on the ground. But in this case we all felt what L. Paul Bremer, the former viceroy in Iraq, has
called the ''8,000-mile screwdriver'' reaching from the Pentagon. Commanders in the field had their discretionary
financing for things like rebuilding hospitals and providing police uniforms randomly cut; money to pay Iraqi
construction firms to build barracks was withheld; contracts we made for purchasing military equipment for the new
Iraqi Army were rewritten back in Washington.
Donald Rumsfeld demands more than loyalty. He wants fealty. And he has hired men who give it. Consider the
new secretary of the Army, Francis Harvey, who when faced with the compelling need to increase the service's size
has refused to do so. He is instead relying on the shell game of hiring civilians to do jobs that had previously been
done by soldiers, and thus keeping the force strength static on paper. This tactic may help for a bit, but it will likely
fall apart in the next budget cycle, with those positions swiftly eliminated.
So, what to do?
First, President Bush should accept the offer to resign that Mr. Rumsfeld says he has tendered more than once,
and hire a man who will listen to and support the magnificent soldiers on the ground. Perhaps a proven Democrat
like Senator Joseph Lieberman could repair fissures that have arisen both between parties and between uniformed
men and the Pentagon big shots.
More vital in the longer term, Congress must assert itself. Too much power has shifted to the executive branch,
not just in terms of waging war but also in planning the military of the future. Congress should remember it still has
the power of the purse; it should call our generals, colonels, captains and sergeants to testify frequently, so that
their opinions and needs are known to the men they lead. Then when they are asked if they have enough troops --
and no soldier has ever had enough of anything, more is always better -- the reply is public.
Our most important, and sometimes most severe, judges are our subordinates. That is a fact I discovered early in
my military career. It is, unfortunately, a lesson Donald Rumsfeld seems incapable of learning.",8,CivMilBalance,,1,,,,Attack of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld,73,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493

or be fired as ""growing military pressure"" for him to do so. These retired generals claim he should go for, among
other things, ignoring the advice of senior military leaders and bungling the global war on terror in Iraq with poorly
planned war-fighting strategies and post-Saddam planning efforts. We strongly disagree.
Like former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Richard Myers, we do not believe that it is appropriate for
active duty, or retired, senior military officers to publicly criticize U.S. civilian leadership during war. Calling for the
secretary's resignation during wartime may undercut the U.S. mission and incites individual challenge to the good
order and discipline of our military culture. At best, such comments may send a confusing message to our troops
deployed on dangerous missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. At worst, they can also inspire and motivate the evil
forces we seek to defeat.
Since our nation's founding, the principle of civilian control over the military has been a centerpiece of our system
of government. Under our constitutional system, it places elected and appointed government leaders in charge.
American soldiers are bound by this tradition to subordinate themselves to civilian authority. We give advice but it
is ultimately up to civilian leaders to make key strategic and policy decisions. Unlike many other democracies, this
is one important reason why we have never been ruled by the military, and have been the most successful
country the world has ever seen.
Some critics suggest that the calls by the six retired generals signify widespread discontent in the military with
Secretary Rumsfeld's leadership. It is preposterous for them to suggest that this small group represents the views
of the 1.4 million men and women serving on active duty or the 7,000 retired generals and flag officers who
respect, understand and appreciate the established American tradition of the military being subordinate to civilian
control and direction.
Moreover, despite the frustration of the current situation in Iraq, military morale remains high, as evidenced by the
high re-enlistment rate of active-duty forces. This fact belies the contention that there is rising military discontent.
The notion that Secretary Rumsfeld doesn't meet with, or ignores the advice of, senior military leaders is not
founded in fact. During his tenure, senior military leaders have been involved to an unprecedented degree in
every decision-making process. In addition to the Senior Level Review Group, Defense Senior Leadership
Conference, and Quadrennial Defense Review, in 2005 Secretary Rumsfeld also participated in meetings
involving service chiefs 110 times and combatant commanders 163 times. Gen. Myers correctly describes these
meetings as ""very collaborative"" with a free flow of information and discussion. Gen. Tommy Franks, U.S. Central
Command Commander during the liberation of Afghanistan and Iraq, echoes Gen. Myers's comments and
supports Secretary Rumsfeld as collaborative in the decision-making process. Gen. Franks has stated recently
that he is a tough collaborator and demands sound thinking and recommendations from the senior military
leadership and staff.
Much of the acrimony expressed by Secretary Rumsfeld's military critics appears to stem from his efforts to
""transform"" the military by moving to a joint expeditionary force that is lighter and more mobile in nature to meet
the nation's current and future threats. Many senior officers and bureaucrats did not support his transformation
goals -- preferring conventional weapons of the past like the Crusader artillery piece and World War II war-fighting
strategies, which prove practically useless against lawless and uncivilized enemies engaged in asymmetric
warfare. It unfortunately appears that two of the retired generals (Messrs. Zinni and Newbold) do not understand
the true nature of this radical ideology, Islamic extremism, and why we fight in Iraq. We suggest they listen to the
tapes of United 93.

Despite criticisms, Mr. Rumsfeld is arguably one of the most effective secretaries of defense our nation has ever
had. Under his watch, the U.S. military has been transforming; it brilliantly deposed Mullah Omar's barbaric
Taliban regime (Osama bin Laden's sanctuary) and Saddam Hussein's ruthless Baathist regime, freeing 50
million people from oppression and placing the countries on democratic paths. With these actions, terrorists have
been denied secure home bases. These are a few key factors why terrorists have been unable to attack the
American homeland again. The policy and forward strategy implemented by Secretary Rumsfeld has taken the
fight to the enemy as did the nation in World War II and the Cold War.

"Bacevich, Andrew",1992,0,2006-07-09,0,0,1,WaPO,Army,,,M,What's an Iraqi Life Worth,"For all the talk of Iraq being a sovereign nation, foreign occupiers are the ones deciding what an Iraqi life is worth. And although President Bush has remarked in a different context that ""every human life is a precious gift of matchless value,"" our actions in Iraq continue to convey the impression that civilian lives aren't worth all that much.","In Iraq, lives differ in value -- and so do deaths. In this disparity lies an important reason why the United States
has botched this war.
Last November in Haditha , a squad of Marines, outraged at the loss of a comrade, is said to have run amok,
avenging his death by killing two dozen innocent bystanders. And in March, U.S. soldiers in Mahmudiyah
allegedly raped a young Iraqi woman and killed her along with three of her relatives -- an apparently premeditated
crime for which one former U.S. soldier has been charged . These incidents are among at least five recent cases
of Iraqi civilian deaths that have triggered investigations of U.S. military personnel. If the allegations prove true,
Haditha and Mahmudiyah will deservedly take their place alongside Sand Creek, Samar and My Lai in the
unhappy catalogue of atrocities committed by American troops.
But recall a more recent incident, in Samarra . On May 30, U.S. soldiers manning a checkpoint there opened fire
on a speeding vehicle that either did not see or failed to heed their command to stop. Two women in the vehicle
were shot dead. One of them, Nahiba Husayif Jassim, 35, was pregnant. The baby was also killed. The driver,
Jassim's brother, had been rushing her to a hospital to give birth. No one tried to cover up the incident: U.S.
military representatives issued expressions of regret.
In all likelihood, we will be learning more about Haditha and Mahmudiyah for months to come, whereas the
Samarra story has already been filed away and largely forgotten. And that's the problem.
The killing at the Samarra checkpoint was not an atrocity; most likely it was an accident, a mistake. Yet plenty of
evidence suggests that in Iraq such mistakes have occurred routinely, with moral and political consequences that
have been too long ignored. Indeed, conscious motivation is beside the point: Any action resulting in Iraqi civilian
deaths, however inadvertent, undermines the Bush administration's narrative of liberation, and swells the ranks of
those resisting the U.S. presence.
Gen. Tommy Franks, who commanded U.S. forces when they entered Iraq more than three years ago, famously
declared: ""We don't do body counts."" Franks was speaking in code. What he meant was this: The U.S. military
has learned the lessons of Vietnam -- where body counts became a principal, and much derided, public measure
of success -- and it has no intention of repeating that experience. Franks was not going to be one of those
generals re-fighting the last war.
Unfortunately, Franks and other senior commanders had not so much learned from Vietnam as forgotten it. This
disdain for counting bodies, especially those of Iraqi civilians killed in the course of U.S. operations, is among the
reasons why U.S. forces find themselves in another quagmire. It's not that the United States has an aversion to all
body counts. We tally every U.S. service member who falls in Iraq, and rightly so. But only in recent months have
military leaders finally begun to count -- for internal use only -- some of the very large number of Iraqi
noncombatants whom American bullets and bombs have killed.
Through the war's first three years, any Iraqi venturing too close to an American convoy or checkpoint was likely
to come under fire. Thousands of these ""escalation of force"" episodes occurred. Now, Lt. Gen. Peter Chiarelli, the
commander of U.S. ground forces in Iraq, has begun to recognize the hidden cost of such an approach. ""People
who were on the fence or supported us"" in the past ""have in fact decided to strike out against us,"" he recently
acknowledged.
Page 123 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
In the early days of the insurgency, some U.S. commanders appeared oblivious to the possibility that excessive
force might produce a backlash. They counted on the iron fist to create an atmosphere conducive to good
behavior. The idea was not to distinguish between ""good"" and ""bad"" Iraqis, but to induce compliance through
intimidation.
""You have to understand the Arab mind,"" one company commander told the New York Times, displaying all the
self-assurance of Douglas MacArthur discoursing on Orientals in 1945. ""The only thing they understand is force --
force, pride and saving face."" Far from representing the views of a few underlings, such notions penetrated into
the upper echelons of the American command. In their book ""Cobra II,"" Michael R. Gordon and Gen. Bernard E.
Trainor offer this ugly comment from a senior officer: ""The only thing these sand niggers understand is force and
I'm about to introduce them to it.""
Such crass language, redolent with racist, ethnocentric connotations, speaks volumes. These characterizations,
like the use of ""gooks"" during the Vietnam War, dehumanize the Iraqis and in doing so tacitly permit the otherwise
impermissible. Thus, Abu Ghraib and Haditha -- and too many regretted deaths, such as that of Nahiba Husayif
Jassim.
As the war enters its fourth year, how many innocent Iraqis have died at American hands, not as a result of
Haditha-like massacres but because of accidents and errors? The military doesn't know and, until recently, has
publicly professed no interest in knowing. Estimates range considerably, but the number almost certainly runs in
the tens of thousands. Even granting the common antiwar bias of those who track the Iraqi death toll -- and
granting, too, that the insurgents have far more blood on their hands -- there is no question that the number of
Iraqi noncombatants killed by U.S. forces exceeds by an order of magnitude the number of U.S. troops killed in
hostile action, which is now more than 2,000.
Who bears responsibility for these Iraqi deaths? The young soldiers pulling the triggers? The commanders who
establish rules of engagement that privilege ""force protection"" over any obligation to protect innocent life? The
intellectually bankrupt policymakers who sent U.S. forces into Iraq in the first place and now see no choice but to
press on? The culture that, to put it mildly, has sought neither to understand nor to empathize with people in the
Arab or Islamic worlds?
There are no easy answers, but one at least ought to acknowledge that in launching a war advertised as a
high-minded expression of U.S. idealism, we have waded into a swamp of moral ambiguity. To assert that ""stuff
happens,"" as Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is wont to do whenever events go awry, simply does not
suffice.
Moral questions aside, the toll of Iraqi noncombatant casualties has widespread political implications. Misdirected
violence alienates those we are claiming to protect. It plays into the hands of the insurgents, advancing their
cause and undercutting our own. It fatally undermines the campaign to win hearts and minds, suggesting to Iraqis
and Americans alike that Iraqi civilians -- and perhaps Arabs and Muslims more generally -- are expendable.
Certainly, Nahiba Husayif Jassim's death helped clarify her brother's perspective on the war. ""God take revenge
on the Americans and those who brought them here,"" he declared after the incident. ""They have no regard for our
lives.""
He was being unfair, of course. It's not that we have no regard for Iraqi lives; it's just that we have much less
regard for them. The current reparations policy -- the payment offered in those instances in which U.S. forces do
own up to killing an Iraq civilian -- makes the point. The insurance payout to the beneficiaries of an American
soldier who dies in the line of duty is $400,000, while in the eyes of the U.S. government, a dead Iraqi civilian is
reportedly worth up to $2,500 in condolence payments -- about the price of a decent plasma-screen TV.
For all the talk of Iraq being a sovereign nation, foreign occupiers are the ones deciding what an Iraqi life is worth.
And although President Bush has remarked in a different context that ""every human life is a precious gift of
matchless value,"" our actions in Iraq continue to convey the impression that civilian lives aren't worth all that
much.
That impression urgently needs to change. To start, the Pentagon must get over its aversion to counting all
bodies. It needs to measure in painstaking detail -- and publicly -- the mayhem we are causing as a byproduct of
what we call liberation. To do otherwise, to shrug off the death of Nahiba Husayif Jassim as just one of those
things that happens in war, only reinforces the impression that Americans view Iraqis as less than fully human.
Unless we demonstrate by our actions that we value their lives as much as the lives of our own troops, our failure

A properly planned counterinsurgency campaign moves the population, by stages, from reluctant acceptance of the counterinsurgent force to, ideally, full support.","THREE years into the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, everyone from slicksleeved privates fighting for survival in Ramadi
to the echelons above reality at the Pentagon still believes that eliminating insurgents will eliminate the insurgency.
They are wrong.
There is a difference between killing insurgents and fighting an insurgency. In three years, the Sunni insurgency
has grown from nothing into a force that threatens our national objective of establishing and maintaining a free,
independent and united Iraq. During that time, we have fought insurgents with airstrikes, artillery, the courage and
tactical excellence of our forces, and new technology worth billions of dollars. We are further from our goal than we
were when we started.
Counterinsurgency is about gaining control of the population, not killing or detaining enemy fighters. A properly
planned counterinsurgency campaign moves the population, by stages, from reluctant acceptance of the
counterinsurgent force to, ideally, full support.
American soldiers deride ''winning hearts and minds'' as the equivalent of sitting around a campfire singing
''Kumbaya.'' But in fact it is a sophisticated, multifaceted, even ruthless struggle to wrest control of a population from
cunning and often brutal foes. The counterinsurgent must be ready and able to kill insurgents -- lots of them -- but
as a means, not an end.
Counterinsurgency is work better suited to a police force than a military one. Military forces -- by tradition,
organization, equipment and training -- are best at killing people and breaking things. Police organizations, on the
other hand, operate with minimum force. They know their job can't be done from miles away by technology. They
are accustomed to face-to-face contact with their adversaries, and they know how to draw street-level information
and support from the populace. The police don't threaten the governments they work under, because they don't
have the firepower to stage coups.
The United States needs a professional police organization specifically for creating and keeping public order in
cooperation with American or foreign troops during international peacekeeping operations. It must be able to help
the military control indigenous populations in failing states like Haiti or during insurgencies like the one in Falluja.
The force should include light armored cavalry and air cavalry paramilitary patrol units to deal with armed guerillas,
as well as linguistically trained and culturally attuned experts for developing and running informants. It should be
skilled and professional at screening and debriefing detainees, and at conducting public information and
Page 2 of 3
Killing Won't Win This War
psychological operations. It must be completely transportable by air and accustomed to working effectively with
American and local military forces.
Bureaucratic ownership of this force will doubtless be controversial. Because the mission of international
peacekeeping entails dealing mostly with civilians, the force would ideally be a civilian organization. But no civilian
department is currently structured in a way that seems suitable.
At least initially, the force would most likely fall under the Department of Defense. The establishing legislation
should include a fire wall, however, to guard against the tendency of paramilitary units to evolve into pure warriors
with berets, boots and bangles.
Crucial to the success of this force is that the American people thoroughly discuss and understand the
organization and its mission. Only by having this discussion can we avoid the example of the Phoenix Program in
Vietnam, which combined the Vietnamese National Police with American advisers to root the Viet Cong shadow
government out of rural villages. The Phoenix Program was highly effective; because it was supposed to be secret,
however, the program was not explained to the American people, and it became impossible to refute charges of
torture and assassination. Without the support of the American people, the program lost momentum and died.
The legislation establishing the police force should firmly anchor it in respect for human rights. Its mission will be to
advance American ideals of justice and freedom under the law, and it must do so by example as well as word. That
will be both difficult and critical in a place like Iraq, where it would have to wrest control of the population from
insurgents who regard beheading hostages with chain saws as acceptable.
Stringent population control measures like curfews, random searches, mandatory presentation of identity
documents, searches of businesses and residences without warrants and preventive detention would be standing
operating procedure. For such measures to be acceptable to the public, they must be based on solid legal ground
and enforced fairly, transparently and impartially.
The police are used to functioning within legal restraints. Our armed forces, however, are used to obeying only the
laws of war and the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice. Soldiers and marines are trained to respond to
force with massive force. To expect them to switch overnight to using force only as permitted by a foreign legal
code, enforced and reviewed by foreign magistrates and judges, is quite unrealistic. It could also threaten their
survival the next time they have to fight a conventional enemy.
Forcing the round peg of our military, which has no equal in speed, firepower, maneuver and shock action, into the
square hole of international law enforcement and population control isn't working. We need a peacekeeping force to
complement our war-fighters, and we need to start building it now.",5,Warfighting,,,,,,,73,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493
"Murtha, John",,1,2006-10-15,0,0,1,WaPO,Marine Corps,,,M,Confessions of a 'Defeatocrat',"Democrats are fighting a war on two fronts: One is combating the spin and intimidation that defines this administration. The other is fighting to change course, to do things better, to substitute smart, disciplined strategy for dogma and denial in Iraq.","The Republicans are running scared. In the White House, on Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail, they're
worried about losing control of Congress. And so the administration and the GOP have launched a desperate
assault on Democrats and our position on the war in Iraq. Defeatists, they call us, and appeasers and -- oh so
cleverly -- ""Defeatocrats.""
Vice President Cheney has accused Democrats of ""self-defeating pessimism."" Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld has faulted us for believing that ""vicious extremists can be appeased."" The White House calls
Democrats the party of ""cut and run.""
It's all baseless name-calling, and it's all wrong. Unless, of course, being a Defeatocrat means taking a good hard
look at the administration's Iraq policy and determining that it's a failure.
In that case, count me in. Because Democrats recognize that we're headed for a far greater disaster in Iraq if we
don't change course -- and soon. This is not defeatism. This is realism.
Our troops who are putting their lives on the line deserve a plan that matches our military prowess with diplomatic
and political skill. They deserve a clear and achievable mission and they deserve to know precisely what it will
take to accomplish it. They deserve answers, not spin.
Our military has done all it can do in Iraq, and the Iraqis want their occupation to end. I support bringing our
troops home at the earliest practicable date, at a rate that will keep those remaining there safe on the ground. It's
time that the White House and the GOP start working with Democrats in Congress to come up with a reasonable
timetable for withdrawal and for handing the Iraqi government over to the Iraqis.
The administration's use of Rovian catchphrases is nothing but propaganda designed to stifle the loyal opposition.
We Democrats are determined to restore our nation's military strength, refocus on the real terrorist threat, bolster
security safeguards at home and reestablish the credible standing we once had in the world. That is not defeatist.
It is a call to formulate and execute a winning game plan for the War on Terror.
Most Democrats voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of military force in Iraq. Regrettably, I was
not one of them. Since entering Congress in 1974, I have always supported the president on issues of war. But in
this case, I made a mistake -- and unlike certain members of the administration, I'm willing to say so. If I had
known in October 2002 what I know now, I would never have voted for the resolution.
Some of my Democratic colleagues questioned whether Iraq posed an immediate threat to our national security;
some were not convinced that Iraq was accelerating the development of nuclear weapons and had an active
chemical and biological weapons program; and almost all believed that Iraq was not involved in the Sept. 11,
2001, attacks. They turned out to be right on all three counts. Nevertheless, since our forces deployed to Iraq,
Democratic support for the troops has never wavered.
In the past nine months alone, $962 billion has been appropriated for the Defense Department, $190 billion for
the war effort. A vast majority of Democrats voted for the funding. Democrats also identified shortfalls in body
armor, armored vehicles and electronic jammers to defeat roadside bombs. Democrats uncovered problems with
the military readiness of our ground forces in the United States and fought for measures to restore it. That's hardly
defeatist.

When U.S. forces first entered Baghdad, the Iraqi people cheered as the statue of Saddam Hussein was torn
from its pedestal. Forty-two months and $400 billion later, we are caught in a civil war in which 61 percent of
Iraqis think killing Americans is justified and the Iraqi people butcher one another at an alarming rate. We are
considered occupiers. The longer we stay, the harder it becomes for the Iraqis to find their own destiny.
The administration's ""stay-the-course"" strategy is not a plan for victory. It's not even a plan. All we have is a new
military blueprint to keep 140,000 troops in Iraq through 2010.
We are seeing an astonishing and unprecedented parade of retired U.S. generals calling for a new direction in
Iraq. These are voices of bravery, experience, conscience and loyalty. These are men who have been taught to
look coldly and objectively at the facts of bloodshed. Can they all be wrong? How about the 15 intelligence
agencies that recently offered the opinion that this war has not made us safer? Are they all defeatists? Are they to
be ignored?
Was Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, former Army chief of staff, a defeatist when he said that it would take several hundred
thousand troops to prevail in Iraq? His recommendation was ignored. Or what about Gen. Jay M. Garner, our first
administrator in Iraq, who recommended that the Iraqi army be kept intact and used to stabilize the country? His
recommendations were ignored. The Iraqi army was disbanded and the former military took their munitions and
went off to form the core of the insurgency. Was former secretary of state Colin L. Powell defeatist when he
warned: ""If you break it, you own it""? Was Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower a defeatist when he ran for
president in 1952 to change the course of Democrat Harry S. Truman's administration in Korea?
Will the White House toss the same tired insults at Sen. John W. Warner (Va.), the Republican chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, who has voiced concern over the situation in Iraq? Or at former secretary of
state James A. Baker III when the commission he is co-chairing delivers its report on reassessing our options in
Iraq?
This administration's insistence on a ""go-it-alone, stay-the-course"" policy in the face of objections from a majority
of Americans and Iraqis and most world public opinion, and in the face of a deteriorating situation, defies logic.
The United States is about to begin its fifth year of occupation and fighting in Iraq. That makes this war longer
than U.S. participation in World Wars I and II, and longer than the Korean War and our own Civil War. With every
year of occupation, our efforts to fight global terrorism and our military's readiness to fight future wars have further
deteriorated, along with our standing in the world. Meanwhile, the radical Islamic cause wins more and more
recruits.
Despite the presence of more than 140,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, 23,000 Americans injured or killed, tens of
thousands of Iraqi deaths and the expenditure of nearly a half a trillion dollars, here are the dismal results:
* In September, 776 U.S troops were wounded in Iraq, the highest monthly toll in more than two years.
* Over the past year, the number of attacks against U.S. personnel has doubled, rising from 400 to more than 800
per week.
* Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, recently acknowledged that sectarian violence has replaced the
insurgency as the single biggest threat to Iraq.
* In the past two months, 6,000 Iraqis died, more than in the first year of the war.
* Last week, electricity output averaged 2.4 hours per day in Baghdad and 10.4 hours nationwide -- 7 percent less
than in the same period in 2005.
* A Sept. 27 World Public Opinion poll indicated that 91 percent of Iraqi Sunnis and 74 percent of Iraqi Shiites
want the Iraqi government to ask U.S.-led forces to withdraw within a year. Ninety-seven percent of Sunnis and
82 percent of Shiites said that the U.S. military presence is ""provoking more conflict than it is preventing."" And
Iraqi support for attacks against U.S.-led forces has increased sharply over the past few months, from 47 percent
to 61 percent.
Now, Karl Rove may call me a defeatist, but can anyone living in the real world deny that these statistics are
heading in the wrong direction? Yet despite this bleak record of performance, the president continues to stand by
his team of failed architects, preferring to prop them up instead of demanding accountability.

With Mr. Gates, look for a fresh start and fresh plan -- with both parties, and the entire cabinet and the military working through a robust interagency process -- to ensure it doesn't happen.","DURING the Watergate scandal, as I remember it, Garry Trudeau published a ''Doonesbury''
strip in which an embattled President Richard Nixon asks his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, ''Well, the Army's still
with us right?''
Haldeman replies, ''Sir, I'll go check.''
Perhaps President Bush and Donald Rumsfeld had a similar discussion after the midterm election results came
in, and Mr. Rumsfeld's resignation as secretary of defense indicates what the answer was.
So, what will the new Democratic-controlled House and Senate and the new Pentagon, apparently to be led by
Robert Gates, have to accomplish over the next two years to bring the Army -- and the other services -- back
''with'' us? I have a few suggestions.
First, on Iraq, the Democratic leadership needs to push the administration to move immediately on whatever
recommendations come from the Iraq Study Group led by James Baker and Lee Hamilton. The decision to hold
the commission's report until after the election was political idiocy -- every day we wait risks the lives of our
soldiers and our Iraqi allies.
At the same time, we need a Manhattan Project-level effort to build the Iraqi security forces. A good blueprint can
be found in an article in the July-August Military Review by Lt. Col. Douglas Ollivant, a former operations officer
with the Army's Fifth Cavalry Regiment in Iraq, and Lt. Eric D. Chewning. The plan is to create new multifaceted
battalions -- blending infantry, armor, engineers and other specialists -- that would live and work beside Iraqi
security forces and civilians. Some of our troops, working largely at the platoon level, have had great success
along these lines; but as the authors note, such small units ''lack the robust staff and sufficient mass to fully
exploit local relationships.'' It's time to replicate that success on a larger scale.
Democrats in Congress must also demand that the administration abide by the old adage, ''Keep your friends
close and your enemies closer,'' in the Middle East. We should return our ambassador to Syria and re-establish
diplomatic relations with Iran as first steps in building a coalition of Iraq's neighbors to plan the way forward. While
their motives may not be identical to ours, they have little desire to see Iraq dissolve into civil war.
It is also vital to reinvigorate the military leadership. First, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Peter
Pace, must begin to act in the role prescribed by the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986. This requires the senior man
in uniform to have direct access to the president, a role denied to him and his predecessor, Gen. Richard Myers,
by Mr. Rumsfeld.
As for the next secretary of defense, he must stand up to his own party. Congressional Republicans have told the
Army that 512,000 troops are enough, and that the Pentagon should pay for them with the money already
allocated, a zero sum game. This would mean raiding the funds that are supposed to go toward the first real Army
modernization program since the Reagan years. (Today, military spending is 4 percent of gross domestic product,
as opposed to 6.2 percent during the hugely successful Reagan build-up and more than 9 percent during the
Vietnam War.)
The Army must rise to at least 570,000 troops to meet the demands placed on it. Before he was forced out as
Army chief of staff in 2003, Gen. Eric Shinseki warned us to ''beware the 12-division foreign policy with a
10-division Army.'' That was a spot-on prediction of the problem we face today.

We must use the situation in Iraq to propel us toward this larger goal, and in doing so, we will also find the right way to wind down our deployment there.","The mission in Iraq is spiraling into failure. American voters have sent a clear message: Bring our troops home,
but don't lose. That's a tall order both for resurgent Democrats, some of whom are calling for a quick withdrawal,
and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which is presumably crafting new options.
Instead of cutting and running or staying the course, it is time for us to begin to redeploy. But how can we do this
and improve our prospects for success?
First, we have to think past Iraq and above partisan politics, folding actions in Iraq into a strategy to protect
broader U.S. interests throughout the region.
Neither the Bush administration's latest pronouncements nor the current political dialogue has adequately
engaged these vital interests. The calamity in Iraq has hogtied the Bush administration, inviting disarray, if not
instability, in neighboring countries that also require our attention.
U.S. interests include dissuading Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons and its hegemonic aspirations, providing
security assurances for the rapidly developing Arab Gulf states and working with our friends in the Middle East to
ensure access to oil resources and regional stability.
Timetables a bad idea
What about a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawals? Today, setting a rigid, Washington-driven timetable is an
option, but a bad one. A precipitous troop reduction could have far-reaching effects: emboldening Iran, weakening
U.S. security promises to friendly states, and even sparking military initiatives by other powers -- Turkey or Iran --
to deal with the resulting security vacuum. Our weakened position in Iraq also could undercut our leverage in the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
What about imposing a tripartite division of Iraq? That would merely feed ethnic cleansing and likely lead to a
wider, more intense conflict.
The right approach is a coordinated diplomatic, legal, economic and security campaign drawing upon broader
dialogue in the region and intensified political work inside Iraq.
Here is how to do this:
*Establish an effective, sustained shuttle diplomacy within the region.
*Form a high-level interagency diplomatic team, representing the White House and secretaries of State and
Defense and led by an experienced, respected diplomat.
*Begin talks within Iraq, and with all its neighbors, based on a clear set of principles outlined by the team. The
goal would be to seek the commitments necessary to achieve our aims inside Iraq and also advance U.S.
interests in the region.
These principles could include: Iraq would remain whole; oil revenue would go to the Iraqi people based on a
formula they determine; the rights and security of individuals must be protected; the United States would have no
permanent bases in Iraq; the covert flow of military arms and equipment into Iraq would be halted; and the
security needs of all states would be respected.
Page 134 of 152 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Regional dialogue needed
A permanent Gulf regional security dialogue could emerge that includes Syria and Iran, and the United States
could undertake a role as regional security guarantor. Preliminary discussions should lead to a more intensive
dialogue with Iran in which security assurances and nuclear programs are discussed.
In terms of diplomacy, our team would engage each state and party, solicit its views and challenge it to participate
in moving forward, just as U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke did in the Balkans a decade ago. Next steps might
include confidence-building measures, hosted discussions between factions, and perhaps one or more larger
meetings to conclude firm commitments, timetables or sequence of events.
Of course there are no guarantees, but from such a dialogue should emerge a prescription for U.S. troop levels
and activities consistent with our larger interests. Carrots and sticks could be employed. For instance, the factions
could vow certain actions in return for U.S. assistance or troop deployments, or redeployments, and possible
assistance from neighboring states.
Reaching an understanding on Iraq need not be a lengthy process, but the dialogue must be broadened in scope
and participation to be effective. The aim would be a consensual solution underwritten by outside guarantors, not
an imposed solution. And finally, military power would have a subordinated and supporting role.
Simultaneously, the United States would set about transforming its applied military power in Iraq into the useful
diplomatic influence essential to addressing broader security concerns.
Ultimately, security in the Gulf and winning against al-Qaeda will require that we work with regional powers,
promote stability and gradual transformation, and regain ""strategic consent"" for long- term U.S. assistance in the
region. We must use the situation in Iraq to propel us toward this larger goal, and in doing so, we will also find the
right way to wind down our deployment there.
The outline of what needs to be done is clear. But does the administration have the courage and foresight to do it,
or will it continue to march into profound failure?",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,73,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493
"Hammes, T.X.",,1,2006-11-26,0,0,1,WaPO,Marine Corps,,,M,The Way to Win a Guerilla War,"This was one of the real sources of frustration during my brief tour of duty in Iraq in 2004. The United States had clearly failed to learn from previous insurgencies. We were focused on killing insurgents rather than providing security and governance. Fortunately, we're now showing signs of learning -- thanks to some smart people who are both practitioners and students of counterinsurgency.","In all the barrels of ink being spilled in the argument over whether the United States can or can't possibly win the war against the insurgency in Iraq, one critical aspect is often overlooked: how the nature of insurgency has changed over the past few decades, and what that means for the counterinsurgent.

Insurgencies are still based on Mao Zedong's fundamental precept that superior political will, properly employed, can defeat greater economic and military power. Because insurgents organize to ensure political rather than military success, an opponent cannot defeat them with military force alone. But complicating our problem today is the fact that insurgencies are no longer the unified, hierarchical organizations that the Chinese, and later the Vietnamese, developed from the 1920s to the 1960s. Rather, they are loose coalitions unified only by the desire to drive out an outside power. All elements of the insurgency know that when the outside power is gone, they will fight a civil war to resolve their differences. Learning to adjust is the key to success in counterinsurgency. Conventional military weakness forces insurgents to be adaptable, so defeating them requires coherent, patient action -- encompassing a range of political, economic, social and military activities -- that can only be executed by a team drawn from all parts of government. You don't outfight the insurgent. You outgovern him.

This was one of the real sources of frustration during my brief tour of duty in Iraq in 2004. The United States had clearly failed to learn from previous insurgencies. We were focused on killing insurgents rather than providing security and governance. Fortunately, we're now showing signs of learning -- thanks to some smart people who are both practitioners and students of counterinsurgency.

Any study of modern insurgency has to start with Mao. The communist leader who defeated China's nationalist forces not only succeeded as an insurgent but also wrote about how he won. ""On Guerrilla Warfare"" is a how-to guide for insurgent leaders that has been quoted by nearly every insurgent strategist since, including al- Qaeda's. The best translation is by Marine Brig. Gen. Samuel B. Griffith, whose fluency in Chinese and extensive travel in China during its civil war enabled him to provide unique insights into Mao's work.

No American discussion of insurgency could ignore Vietnam. Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap's ""People's War, People's Army"" is still the basic reference on the North Vietnamese view of the war and an illustration of how warfare continually changes. While Mao was able to confront his opponent on the Chinese mainland, Ho Chi Minh and Giap had to defeat the French and the Americans without ever being able to threaten their home bases. They expanded on Mao's concept by using the media and peace activists to convince the American people that we couldn't win the war. They won not by defeating our armed forces but by breaking our political will.

In the 30 years since the fall of Saigon, insurgency has continued to evolve. For an up-to-date overview, National Defense University professor Bard O'Neill's ""Insurgency and Terrorism: From Revolution to Apocalypse,"" published in 2005, is hard to beat.

Counterinsurgency is a very different animal. Insurgents practice the art of destruction, which is easy; counterinsurgents have the far more difficult task of creating a functioning government. Written in 1964, David Galula's ""Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice"" is still one of the best books to make this case. Galula, who was a French army officer during World War II and later in Indochina and Algeria, makes it clear that counterinsurgency is not about killing insurgents but about providing security and the hope for a better future. If a government can't give its people both, the insurgents will overthrow it.

""Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam,"" by Lt. Col. John Nagl, is a comparison between the British experience in Malaya from 1948 to 1960 and the U.S. experience in Vietnam. The British army, Nagl says, managed to created a ""learning institution"" that was able to understand the type of war it was in and adjust accordingly. In contrast, the U.S. Army in Vietnam kept trying to apply conventional warfare doctrine to an unconventional war. By the time it finally did adjust, it was too late.

Journal articles offer another rich vein of enlightenment on the conduct of counterinsurgency. In ""Best Practices in Counterinsurgency,"" in the May-June 2005 issue of Military Review, Kalev I. Sepp, a former Special Forces officer and now professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, studied 51 recent counterinsurgencies to develop a list of 12 ""best practices"" common to all successful ones, and nine ""worst practices"" of the unsuccessful ones. Sadly, in Iraq, the United States scores below 50 percent on the first and above 50 percent on the second.

David Kilcullen's ""Counterinsurgency Redux"" appears in the current issue of Survival. I've found it the best discussion of insurgency's evolution from classical Maoist to the modern transnational, multilateral ""coalitions of the willing"" that challenge the United States today. ""In modern counter-insurgency,"" Kilcullen writes, ""the security force must control a complex 'conflict ecosystem' -- rather than defeating a single specific insurgent adversary."" This is a long way from the monolithic organizations Galula fought.

Two important articles are written from the unique perspective of a senior military officer fighting an active counterinsurgency. In ""Challenges in Fighting a Global Insurgency,"" in the summer 2006 issue of Parameters, Lt. Gen. David W. Barno, commander of U.S. and Coalition forces in Afghanistan from October 2003 to April 2005, highlights the insurgents' ability to think in terms of 25-year wars. ""The Americans may have all the wristwatches,"" he quotes the Taliban reminding villagers, ""but we have all the time."" And in his influential ""Winning the Peace: The Requirement for Full-Spectrum Operations"" in the July-August 2005 Military Review, Maj. Gen. Peter Chiarelli describes how his division in Baghdad not only had to conduct combat operations but also train Iraqi security forces, provide essential services, promote Iraqi efforts to establish an effective government and foster economic competition in what had been a controlled economy.

All these sources influenced the new Army/Marine Corps Field Manual 3-24, ""Counterinsurgency."" Posted on the Internet in draft form, it updates the badly outdated doctrine based on U.S. experiences in the 1960s, offering thought-provoking observations such as ""The best weapons for counterinsurgency do not shoot bullets"" and ""The more force you use, the less effective you are."" It's already influencing both how the military is fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and how it is preparing for future wars.

If you're not inclined to read an Army field manual, three notable movies provide an insight into at least one aspect of counterinsurgency. David Lean's 1962 epic ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" based on T.E. Lawrence's experiences in the Arab World War I uprising against the Turks, illustrates how hard it is for an outsider to understand another culture well enough to advise effectively. The 1966 classic ""Battle of Algiers"" shows how French brutality lost the war in Algeria. And 1993's ""In the Name of the Father"" reinforces that message, showing how ""aggressive interrogation"" techniques came back to haunt the British in their campaign against the Irish Republican Army -- a valuable insight for those trying to win these most difficult of wars.",6,Warfighting,,,,,,,73,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493
"McCaffrey, Barry",1995,1,2006-12-13,0,0,1,WaPO,Army,,,M,Beyond Baker-Hamilton: One Approch to a Last Try at Stability in Iraq,"All of this may not work. We have very few options left. In my judgment, taking down the Saddam Hussein regime was a huge gift to the Iraqi people. Done right, it might have left the region and the United States safer for years to come. But the American people have withdrawn their support for the war, although they remain intensely committed to and protective of our armed forces. We have run out of time.

We owe them and our own national interest this one last effort. If we cannot generate the political will to take this action, it is time to pull out and search for those we will hold responsible in Congress and the administration.","A collapse of the Iraqi state would be catastrophic -- for the people of Iraq, for the Middle East and for America's strategic interests. We need a new political and military approach to head off this impending disaster -- one crafted with bipartisan congressional support. But Baker-Hamilton isn't it.

Our objective should be a large-scale U.S. military withdrawal within the next 36 months, leaving in place an Iraqi government in a stable and mostly peaceful country that does not threaten its six neighboring states and does not intend to possess weapons of mass destruction.

The courage and skill of the U.S. armed forces have been awe- inspiring. Our soldiers, Marines and Special Operations forces have suffered 25,000 wounded and killed, with many thousands permanently maimed, while fighting this $400 billion war.

But the situation in Iraq is perilous and growing worse. Thousands of Iraqis are killed each month; hundreds of thousands are refugees. The government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is largely dysfunctional. Our allies, including the brave and competent British, are nearly gone. Baghdad has become the central battlefield in this struggle, which involves not just politically inspired civil war but also rampant criminality and violence carried out by foreign jihadists. Shiite and Sunni Arabs overwhelmingly anticipate and endorse a U.S. strategic withdrawal and defeat.

We could immediately and totally withdraw. In less than six months, our 150,000 troops could fight their way along strategic withdrawal corridors back to the sea and the safety provided by the Navy. Several million terrified refugees would follow, the route of our columns marked by the burning pyres of abandoned military supplies demolished by our rear guard. The resulting civil warfare would probably turn Iraq into a humanitarian disaster and might well draw in the Iranians and Syrians. It would also deeply threaten the safety and stability of our allies in neighboring countries.

There is a better option. First, we must commit publicly to provide $10 billion a year in economic support to the Iraqis over the next five years. In the military arena, it would be feasible to equip and increase the Iraqi armed forces on a crash basis over the next 24 months (but not the police or the Facilities Protection Service). The goal would be 250,000 troops, provided with the material and training necessary to maintain internal order.

Within the first 12 months we should draw down the U.S. military presence from 15 Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), of 5,000 troops each, to 10. Within the next 12 months, Centcom forces should further draw down to seven BCTs and withdraw from urban areas to isolated U.S. operating bases -- where we could continue to provide oversight and intervention when required to rescue our embedded U.S. training teams, protect the population from violence or save the legal government.

Finally, we have to design and empower a regional diplomatic peace dialogue in which the Iraqis can take the lead, engaging their regional neighbors as well as their own alienated and fractured internal population.

We are in a very difficult position created by a micromanaged Rumsfeld war team that has been incompetent, arrogant and in denial. The departing defense secretary, in a recent farewell Pentagon town hall meeting, criticized the alleged distortions of the U.S. media, saying that they chose to report a few bombs going off in Baghdad rather than the peaceful scene he witnessed from his helicopter flying over the city. This was a perfect, and incredible, continuation of Donald Rumsfeld's willful blindness in his approach to the war. From the safety of his helicopter, he apparently could not hear the nearly constant rattle of small-arms fire, did not know of the hundreds of Marines and soldiers being killed or wounded each month, or see the chaos, murder and desperation of daily life for Iraqi families.

Let me add a note of caution regarding a deceptive and unwise option that springs from the work of the Iraq Study Group. We must not entertain the shallow, partisan notion of rapidly withdrawing most organized Marine and Army fighting units by early 2008 and substituting for them a much larger number of U.S. advisers -- a 400 percent increase -- as a way to avoid a difficult debate for both parties in the New Hampshire primaries.

This would leave some 40,000 U.S. logistics and adviser troops spread out and vulnerable, all over Iraq. It would decrease our leverage with Iraq's neighbors. It would not get at the problem of a continuing civil war. In fact, significantly increasing the number of U.S. advisers in each company and battalion of the Iraqi army and police -- to act as role models -- is itself a bad idea. We are foreigners. They want us gone.

Lack of combat experience is not the central issue Iraqis face. Their problems are corrupt and incompetent ministries, poor equipment, an untrained and unreliable sectarian officer corps (a result of Rumsfeld's disbanding the Iraqi army), and a lack of political will caused by the failure of a legitimate Iraqi government to emerge.

We need fewer advisers, not more -- selected from elite, active military units and with at least 90 days of immersion training in Arabic. Iraqi troops will not fight because of iron discipline enforced by U.S. sergeants and officers. That is a self-serving domestic political concept that would put us at risk of a national military humiliation.

All of this may not work. We have very few options left. In my judgment, taking down the Saddam Hussein regime was a huge gift to the Iraqi people. Done right, it might have left the region and the United States safer for years to come. But the American people have withdrawn their support for the war, although they remain intensely committed to and protective of our armed forces. We have run out of time. Our troops and their families will remain bitter for a generation if we abandon the Iraqis, just as another generation did after we abandoned the South Vietnamese for whom Americans had fought and died. We owe them and our own national interest this one last effort. If we cannot generate the political will to take this action, it is time to pull out and search for those we will hold responsible in Congress and the administration.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,73,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493
"Ryan, Kevin",2003,1,2006-12-18,0,0,1,WaPO,Army,,,M,Stretched Too Thin; We Don't Have Enough Troops to Meet Defense Demands,"Throughout the 1980s we recruited an Army of more than 750,000 entirely from volunteers: the same Army that won the Persian Gulf War. It will take several years to recruit additional troops and build the organizations and facilities to house them, but these numbers are well within our reach.","When America's top general in charge of Iraq, John Abizaid, told Congress last month that our Army was unable to increase the number of troops deployed in Iraq, it was a first-of-its-kind admission from a senior defense official: that our ground forces had reached their capacity for military action. ""This is not an Army that was built to sustain a 'long war,' "" Abizaid told students at a Harvard lecture two days later. This is an Army built to achieve victory with speed and precision. This is a short-war Army fighting a long war.

On Dec. 6, the day after Robert Gates told Congress that he is ""open to the possibility of an increase"" in the size of our ground forces, the Iraq Study Group released its report, which declared that ""America's military capacity is stretched thin."" And last week the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Peter Schoomaker, told Congress that the Army is prepared to add up to 7,000 soldiers per year to its ranks if authorized.

The stage has been set for a serious discussion about the appropriate size for our Army: a discussion that should balance resources with demands. Today the 37 combat brigades of the active Army are almost totally consumed by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. With all units either deployed, returning from deployment or preparing to deploy, there are none left to prepare for other contingencies. Active brigades have only 14 months at home before they are recalled for their next 12-month deployment. The National Guard can muster only two or three of its 15 enhanced brigades at any given time, largely because of crippling equipment shortages.

The lack of ground forces has an impact beyond the ability to commit more troops to Iraq. Our published defense strategy requires a military that can defend our homeland, sustain two major wars, be present in key regions abroad and fight a global war on terrorism. With Marine and Army ground forces barely large enough to fight the two major wars, the other security tasks are left to flyovers and ship visits from our Air Force and Navy. According to Schoomaker, America is ""on a dangerous path that dictates we must increase our strategic depth, increase readiness and reduce our operational risk."" If Afghanistan and Iraq are typical of the two-war capability called for in our defense strategy, our Army must be able to sustain a deployment of 14 brigades. To do this and achieve the Defense Department goal of two years at home for every year in combat, the Army would need 56 brigades in its structure. To meet the demands of homeland defense, foreign presence and a global war on terrorism, one could make a good case that America must be able to sustain an additional five to seven brigades in deployment, which would require 20 to 28 more brigades in the structure.

A rough estimate therefore of active and Guard brigades needed for our defense strategy would be between 76 and 84. And these numbers assume that America's other ground force, the Marine Corps, continues to provide the forces it already does in the Middle East and around the globe. Currently the Army has 52 brigades (37 active and 15 enhanced Guard) and has authority to build to 70 brigades (42 active and 28 Guard), but Congress has not authorized enough troops to man these units.

The 2007 defense budget pays for only 512,000 active-duty soldiers. The Army needs a minimum of 575,000 to man the brigades our defense strategy requires. America must bring its military capabilities back in balance with its strategic demands.

Support is building to correct this mismatch. Colin Powell, the former secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said yesterday that both the Army and Marine Corps need to grow in size. Former Army chief of staff Gordon Sullivan has called for the active Army to have between 560,000 and 600,000 soldiers. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona has called for the active Army and Marine Corps to increase by 100,000 troops. The United States Army Relief Act, sponsored by Democratic senators Jack Reed, Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman and Bill Nelson, calls for an increase in end strength of 20,000 per year over the next four years. These recommendations all bring us closer to the mark.

Throughout the 1980s we recruited an Army of more than 750,000 entirely from volunteers: the same Army that won the Persian Gulf War. It will take several years to recruit additional troops and build the organizations and facilities to house them, but these numbers are well within our reach.",7,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,73,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493

When that day comes, gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are, and the military will no longer need to sacrifice those whose service it cannot afford to lose.","TWO weeks ago, President Bush called for a long-term plan to increase the size of the armed forces. As our
leaders consider various options for carrying out Mr. Bush's vision, one issue likely to generate fierce debate is
''don't ask, don't tell,'' the policy that bars openly gay service members from the military. Indeed, leaders in the new
Congress are planning to re-introduce a bill to repeal the policy next year.
As was the case in 1993 -- the last time the American people thoroughly debated the question of whether openly
gay men and lesbians should serve in the military -- the issue will give rise to passionate feelings on both sides. The
debate must be conducted with sensitivity, but it must also consider the evidence that has emerged over the last 14
years.
When I was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I supported the current policy because I believed that
implementing a change in the rules at that time would have been too burdensome for our troops and commanders. I
still believe that to have been true. The concern among many in the military was that given the longstanding view
that homosexuality was incompatible with service, letting people who were openly gay serve would lower morale,
harm recruitment and undermine unit cohesion.
In the early 1990s, large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians
serve. President Bill Clinton, who promised to lift the ban during his campaign, was overwhelmed by the strength of
the opposition, which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take. The compromise that came to be
known as ''don't ask, don't tell'' was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time
while the culture continued to evolve.
The question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration. Much
evidence suggests that it has.
Last year I held a number of meetings with gay soldiers and marines, including some with combat experience in
Iraq, and an openly gay senior sailor who was serving effectively as a member of a nuclear submarine crew. These
conversations showed me just how much the military has changed, and that gays and lesbians can be accepted by
their peers.
This perception is supported by a new Zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from Afghanistan
and Iraq, three quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people. And 24 foreign nations,
including Israel, Britain and other allies in the fight against terrorism, let gays serve openly, with none reporting
morale or recruitment problems.
Page 2 of 3
Second Thoughts on Gays in the Military
I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine
the efficacy of the armed forces. Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and
we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job.
But if America is ready for a military policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, the timing of the
change should be carefully considered. As the 110th Congress opens for business, some of its most urgent
priorities, like developing a more effective strategy in Iraq, share widespread support that spans political affiliations.
Addressing such issues could help heal the divisions that cleave our country. Fighting early in this Congress to lift
the ban on openly gay service members is not likely to add to that healing, and it risks alienating people whose
support is needed to get this country on the right track.
By taking a measured, prudent approach to change, political and military leaders can focus on solving the nation's
most pressing problems while remaining genuinely open to the eventual and inevitable lifting of the ban. When that
day comes, gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are, and the military will no longer need
to sacrifice those whose service it cannot afford to lose.",10,SocialPolicy,,,,,,"The author is clearly addressing a past opinion he had regarding DADT, and the specific military implications of the policy.",69,109,2005,0.809986312,0.686145455,32.2203157,35.8318493

Isolating our adversaries hasn't worked.","The odds are that this week President Bush will announce a ""surge"" of up to 20,000 additional U.S. troops into
Iraq. Will this deliver a ""win""? Probably not. But it will distract us from facing the deep-seated regional issues that
must be resolved.
The administration views a troop surge of modest size as virtually the only remaining action in Iraq that would be
a visible signal of determination. More economic assistance is likely to be touted, but absent a change in the
pattern of violence, infrastructure enhancement simply isn't practical.
Yes, several additional brigades in Baghdad would allow for more roadblocks, patrols and neighborhood-clearing
operations. Some initial successes would be evident. But how significant would this be? We've never had enough
troops in Iraq. In Kosovo, we had 40,000 troops for a population of 2 million. That ratio would call for at least
500,000 troops in Iraq; adding 20,000 now seems too little, too late.
Further, U.S. troops so far have lacked the language skills, cultural awareness and political legitimacy to ensure
that areas ""cleared"" can be ""held."" The key would be more Iraqi troops, but they aren't available in the numbers
required. Nor are the Iraqi troops reliable enough for the gritty work of dealing with militias and sectarian loyalties.
Even if militia fighters in Baghdad can be temporarily suppressed, they could redeploy to continue the fight in
other areas.
What the surge would do is put more American troops in harm's way, further undercut the morale of U.S. forces
and risk further alienating elements of the Iraqi populace. American casualties would probably rise, at least
temporarily, as more troops appeared on the streets -- as happened in the summer when a brigade from Alaska
was extended and sent into Baghdad. And even if the increased troop presence initially frustrated the militias, it
wouldn't be long before they found ways to work around the neighborhood searches and other obstacles, if they
chose to continue the conflict.
Other uses for troops include accelerating training of the Iraqi military and police. But vetting these Iraqi forces for
loyalty has proved problematic. So neither accelerated training nor adding Iraqi troops to the security mission can
be viewed as though a specified increase in effort would yield an identical increase in return.
The truth is that the underlying problems are political, not military.
Vicious ethnic cleansing is underway, as various factions fight for power and survival. In this environment,
security is unlikely to come from smothering the struggle with a blanket of forces -- and increasing U.S. efforts is
likely to generate additional resistance, especially from Iraq's neighbors. More effective action is needed to
resolve the struggle at the political level. A new U.S. ambassador might help, but the administration needs to
recognize that the neoconservative vision has failed.
Well before the 2003 invasion, the Bush administration was sending signals that its intentions weren't limited to
Iraq; ""regime change"" in Syria and Iran was often discussed in Washington. Small wonder then that both
countries have worked continuously to feed the fighting in Iraq.
Dealing with meddling neighbors is an essential element of resolving the conflict in Iraq. But this requires more
than border posts and threatening statements. The administration needs a new strategy for the region, before Iran
gains nuclear capabilities. While the military option must remain on the table, America should take the lead with
direct diplomacy to resolve the interrelated problems of Iran's push for regional hegemony and nuclear power, the
struggle for control of Lebanon, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Isolating our adversaries hasn't worked.

Absent such fundamental change in Washington's approach, there is little hope that a troop surge and

Unbelievably, in its Pentagon appropriations bill for 2007, Congress cut in half the financing for the Army's main research and treatment program on brain injury (which, no surprise, is at Walter Reed).","IN his 1997 book ''Dereliction of Duty,'' Col. H. R. McMaster wrote that ''the 'five silent men' on the Joint Chiefs
made possible the way the United States went to war in Vietnam.'' So it is today with the war in Iraq. Regrettably,
the silence of our top officers has had a huge impact not just on the battlefield but also on how we have brought our
injured warriors home from it. These planning failures led to the situation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center
recently reported by The Washington Post, which resulted in the firings of the hospital's commander and the
secretary of the Army.
The sad truth is that The Post's reports weren't entirely new: Mark Benjamin, of United Press International and the
Web magazine Salon, and Steve Robinson, the director of veterans affairs at Veterans for America, have been
reporting on the disgraceful treatment of our war wounded since 2003. More important, the Walter Reed scandal is
simply the tip of the iceberg: President Bush, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Congress all
pointedly failed to provide the money and resources for our returned troops wherever they are, both the obviously
wounded and those who may seem healthy but are suffering mentally and physically from their service.
Soldiers have long joked: ''If you are really sick or injured, Army medical care is O.K. But if you are hurting only a
little, especially if it isn't visible, you're in big trouble.'' The American soldier still receives the best trauma care in the
world, especially at Walter Reed. The problem there has been with deplorable outpatient care management. The
military health system is seriously undermanned and underfinanced for the number of casualties coming home.
Also, there has been little preparation for identifying and treating post-traumatic stress injuries.
Last year, because of spending in Iraq, the Army had a $530 million shortfall in its budget for posts at home and
abroad. This forced the Army's vice chief of staff, Richard Cody, to tighten belts that were already at the last notch.
Hospitals have taken a big part of the financial hit. General Cody has warned Congress that failure to shore up the
tottering military health care system could become a ''retention issue.'' David Chu, the Pentagon's under secretary
for personnel and readiness, told The Wall Street Journal that veterans' costs ''are taking away from the nation's
ability to defend itself.''
The result is that Walter Reed and every other domestic Army post have struggled to house soldiers properly after
their release from the hospital. For the lucky ones, family members pick up the slack, making sure that follow-up
care is provided, that prescription drug regimens are followed, that therapists show up for rehabilitation sessions.
Those without family help tend to slip between the cracks.
Page 2 of 4
Casualties of the Budget Wars
Walter Reed, in particular, has another problem. The Base Realignment and Closure Commission decided in 2005
to shutter this critical hospital. I won't debate that decision now -- what's done is done -- but when the commission
decides you will close within a few years, money dries up real fast. It is no wonder that buildings fell into disrepair
and recovering soldiers slipped off the radar screen.
This was the fiscal environment that Maj. Gen. George Weightman stepped into last August when he took
command of Walter Reed. I have known George since he was a plebe at West Point. He is bright, honorable and
energetic -- and always capable. But as another of his admirers told me, ''He was the captain of that ship.'' And now
he has gone down with his ship -- the victim of Mr. Rumsfeld's wrongheaded cost-cutting and the joint chiefs' failure
to stand up to the civilian leadership.
So, what can we do to ensure that good men like General Weightman aren't put in impossible situations and, more
important, that our fighting men and women get the care they need? A good first step has been taken: Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates fired the secretary of the Army, Francis Harvey, who was a true Rumsfeld man and viewed
by many as more loyal to his boss than to the Army. But some other prescriptions seem obvious:
I would encourage every member of Congress, ever senior Pentagon official and every White House staff member
to read the articles Mark Benjamin has written on soldier care, beginning with the 2003 report he did on Fort
Stewart in Georgia. The train in this wreck left the station a long time ago.
The Pentagon must do something it has, amazingly, never tried: develop an official doctrine on how to ''redeploy''
a soldier from the combat zone to the peaceful zone. This means hiring mental health experts to thoroughly analyze
the psychology of the returning soldier, and making a commitment to building a health care network that can meet
the needs of a growing population of injured soldiers.
Congress must increase financing for research into traumatic brain injuries, the signature malady of this war.
Unbelievably, in its Pentagon appropriations bill for 2007, Congress cut in half the financing for the Army's main
research and treatment program on brain injury (which, no surprise, is at Walter Reed).
The government should also expand grants to the Fisher House program, a public-private partnership that has
''comfort homes'' at every major military medical center. These provide families of wounded troops with housing,
kitchens, laundry rooms and other support services. The program serves more than 8,500 families a year, but will
struggle to keep pace with the growing number of returning wounded.
Like so many government departments, the military has a medical computer system that is made up of a
hodgepodge of antiquated machines with outdated software that often can't communicate with one another. This
needs to be replaced with a user-friendly system that can efficiently track the wounded as they make their way
through the system.
The Pentagon must revamp the Medical Evaluation Board process, the system under which a soldier suffering
from injury is screened to see if he should be given a discharge and a disability pension. Cases now are handled in
a haphazard way and can drag out indefinitely; each should be held to a disciplined timeline.
The general effort by Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Harvey to privatize services at Army bases needs to be reined in.
Some of the problems at Walter Reed seem to have been caused by the contracting out of maintenance services
and other support jobs.
While we address the needs of uniformed men and women, we need to assess our civilian employees as well;
most are excellent, but some are entrenched and in need of firing.
The money to care for our soon-to-be-veteran soldiers should not come from the Defense Department budget. The
immense costs of medical care are simply too attractive to Pentagon budget-cutters, creating a conflict of interest
between the war effort and the health of our troops.
And, of course, we must move the outpatient soldiers out of Walter Reed immediately. It is a small, old installation
with few recreational outlets in a neighborhood of Washington that is unwelcoming to patients' families. Fort Lewis

in Washington State, for example, is a large, well-equipped installation in a beautiful area with a good program for
recovering soldiers. And the big goal should be to get our wounded troops off bases entirely and back their own
homes, with adequate medical care and insurance.
The other day I had a phone conversation with Mr. Robinson, a former Army Ranger whose group aids Persian
Gulf war veterans suffering with health disorders. ''The problem with Walter Reed and the nation's defense health
program is much more than money, mold and mice,'' he said. ''It is about leadership.'' He's right. And with Secretary
Gates, I expect the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be able to resume their rightful role in our nation's defense",8,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,69,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,32.2203157,35.8318493

Tehran has the world scrambling to respond as it sets about assembling a nuclear weapon that may be more advanced than Fat Man and Little Boy, but which is still far less technologically advanced than the weapons systems we trust 20-somethings to operate every day in our military. Forcing Iran to expend its resources to keep pace with our technological advances is central to any strategy of defeating them.","President Reagan once famously quipped that his strategy in confronting the Soviet Union was ""We win, they lose."" Today, we need a similarly clear strategy to confront Iran, if we are to successfully counter its aim to drive the U.S. from the Middle East and -- as we see with the 15 British sailors the Iranians have taken hostage -- attempts to intimidate Western powers into inaction.

That strategy begins not with the Kabuki dance now underway at the United Nations. Turtle Bay is usually, and seems destined to be again in this case, a diplomatic sideshow meant more to distract us than to disarm a rogue regime.

While we dither the Iranians will acquire nuclear weapons, give support to our enemies in Iraq and undermine our credibility with our European allies. We need to demonstrate now that there are viable military options in dealing with a rogue regime in Tehran and that not all of those options will leave us embroiled in a shooting war with yet another large, sprawling nation in the Middle East.

I believe that our options for dealing with Iran are more numerous and could be more productive than many Washington policy makers have heretofore argued. Let us remember that Iran is a very diverse nation whose population is only 51% Persian. The rest is Azari (24%), Kurdish (10%) and a mix of other ethnic minorities including Turkman, Arab and others. This is a rich environment for unrest and one reason why there were an estimated 4,300 protest demonstrations in 2005 alone. In recent weeks, we may have benefited from another form of protest. Former Iranian deputy defense minister Ali Reza Asgari appears to have used a trip to Turkey to defect with his family. If he is now talking to Western intelligence officials, we'll soon know a lot more about the inner workings of the Iranian regime.

And the Middle East itself is no monolithic bloc of support for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Israel, of course, is a natural ally in gaining intelligence and lining up support against the Iranian regime. But Iran is bent on destabilizing and dominating the Arabian Peninsula from Lebanon through Gaza into Iraq with a stopover in Bahrain. That makes Saudi Arabia as well as Jordan potentially strong -- if not overt -- allies in countering Iranian influence. The situation has gotten so serious that King Abdullah of Jordan called it a Shia crescent sweeping across the Arabian Peninsula and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia summoned Vice President Cheney to Riyadh last fall.

If we demonstrate that we are sufficiently serious in countering Iran, we could form a coalition of the willing with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, the Gulf States, Turkey, Australia and those European allies with the courage to consider what their future will look like with a nuclear-armed Iran within missile range. No more denial or hoping Iran will negotiate their nuclear weapons development away. The criteria for joining this coalition would be to join in making the following demands of Iran: Stop developing fissile material, submit to unambiguous International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, turn over all al Qaeda operatives within your borders and stop supporting Hezbollah.

The hard part, of course, of forming any meaningful coalition is the consequences of noncompliance. And this case is no different. The obvious punishment for a defiant Iran could be an air strike that aims to destroy its nuclear development facilities and overt support for Iranians working to overthrow their government. This is where the discussion of taking stringent actions against Iran usually breaks down. Few people believe Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations would join a coalition that carried out a military strike and there is little reason to believe many European nations would either.

This is where President Reagan in confronting the Soviets is instructive. The Gipper was elected in 1980 at a time when it appeared inevitable that the Soviet Union would dominate world affairs and just as inevitably that the U.S. was unable to do anything about it short of waging a bloody, military campaign that would have few allies in fighting and not every chance of success. In the end, as they say, Reagan won the Cold War without firing a shot.

We have similar options now. One of which is to enact drastic economic sanctions that, oddly, would involve forcing a gasoline crisis in Iran. Tehran is kept afloat on oil revenues, but it has done so at the expense of its oil industry. While it exports large quantities of crude oil, Iran imports 40% of its domestically consumed gasoline, and each gallon at the pump is heavily subsidized. Shutting off or even restricting the supply of gasoline flowing into the country would put the regime in a crunch and drive up public discontent without creating a corresponding humanitarian crisis.

We could also apply minimal military pressure without straining our relations with our allies. To date Iran is responsible for killing more than 200 American soldiers and wounding over 635 through the introduction of what the U.S. military calls Explosively Formed Penetrators. These EFPs are shaped charges specifically designed to pierce the hulls of our armored vehicles and are much deadlier than what al Qaeda and run-of-the-mill insurgents could have come up with on their own in Iraq. Enough is enough. We could develop a tit-for-tat strategy for each EFP that is detonated in Iraq that could target nuclear support facilities or Iranian leadership or other targets calculated to put heat on the regime without endangering civilians. Many of these responses may be written off as mere happenstance or accidents in a dangerous part of the world. But even as Iran becomes the unluckiest country in the world, our allies in the region could hardly blame us for a calculated response.

The U.S. can also assemble a large-scale force capable of an air offensive. This would serve a similar role to Reagan's military buildup, forcing the Soviets into an arms race that they ultimately couldn't maintain. The immediate strike force could be composed of some 75 stealth attack aircraft -- B2s, F117s and the F22s -- and some 250 nonstealth F15s, F16s, B52s, B1s and three carrier battle groups. These carrier battle groups are composed of over 120 F18s and cruise missiles galore. We also have over 750 UAVs for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in Iraq today. There is more than enough to support a campaign aimed at demonstrating to the Iranian regime that with 48 hours we could hit its nuclear development facilities, command and control facilities, integrated air defenses, Air Force and Navy units and the Shahab 3 missiles using over 2,500 aim points.

Back in Washington, Congress also needs to exercise its responsibility and fund missile defenses, bunker busters and other technologies specifically designed to counter the Iranian regime. Tehran has the world scrambling to respond as it sets about assembling a nuclear weapon that may be more advanced than Fat Man and Little Boy, but which is still far less technologically advanced than the weapons systems we trust 20-somethings to operate every day in our military. Forcing Iran to expend its resources to keep pace with our technological advances is central to any strategy of defeating them.

We don't need to drop leaflets from the air spelling it out for the regime in Tehran that, if we were to carry out an air campaign, it would probably unleash a new Iranian revolution. But the leadership in Iran has to first come to understand that we neither fear a Hezbollah uprising over such a strike -- as Hezbollah is already carrying out terrorist attacks, we'd welcome an open fight on our terms -- nor would we need the main-line coalition ground forces we used in Iraq. Instead, we could simply use the Afghan model of precision airpower supporting covert and indigenous forces.

Joining the treaty is a national security action that would protect our country and its interests.","AS the world's most significant maritime power, the United States protects its national security interests by full
freedom of navigation around the globe. The seas make up about 70 percent of the surface of the earth. Yet we
have not ratified an international treaty that would enable our armed forces to defend us at home and abroad with
legal certainty, and would vastly increase our sovereign rights off the coasts of the United States.
That treaty is the Convention of the Law of the Sea, and the Senate should ratify it during this session of
Congress as President Bush has requested. Joining the treaty is a national security action that would protect our
country and its interests.
The treaty provides our military the rights of navigation, by water and by air, to take our forces wherever they must
go, whenever it is necessary to do so. Our ships -- including vessels that carry more than 90 percent of the logistic
and other support for our troops overseas -- are given the right of innocent passage through the territorial seas of
other states. In addition, the treaty permits American warships to board stateless vessels on the high seas.
The treaty also provides an absolute right of passage through, over and under international straits and through
archipelagoes like Indonesia. These rights -- the crown jewels of the treaty -- did not exist before 1982, when the
Convention was concluded. Our security and economic interests are tied directly to these rights.
Another provision in the treaty establishes the breadth of the territorial sea -- the area within which a state may
exercise sovereignty -- at 12 miles. This allows the United States to extend its territorial sea from three miles to 12
miles, while making several other nations reduce their excessive claims.
Our national security interests alone should be sufficient to persuade the Senate to act now. But the Convention
also advances the economic interests of our country. It gives us an exclusive economic zone out to 200 miles, with
sovereign rights for exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing the living and non-living natural resources of the
zone. Coastal states are given sovereign rights over the continental shelf beyond 200 miles if the shelf meets
specific geological and other scientific criteria. Under the Convention, our Arctic continental shelf could extend out
to 600 miles.
Our nation will be in a much stronger position to advance its military and economic interests if we ratify the treaty.
We can guide and influence the interpretation of rules, protecting our interests and deflecting inconsistent
interpretations. The agreement is being interpreted, applied and developed right now and we need to be part of it to
protect our vital interests in the area of security and beyond.

A Treaty That Lifts All Boats
The treaty is more favorable to our security interests now than we could achieve if we started all over again today.
Yet as the debate over ratification takes place, you will see and hear arguments against it that are confected of halftruths
and imagination.
The treaty does not authorize a ''United Nations navy'' or ''United Nations taxes.'' We are not giving away
American sovereignty by ratifying it, nor would joining it hinder our intelligence activities. An international institution
would not control the world's oceans.
The Reagan administration objected to certain treaty provisions related to seabed mining. But a 1994 agreement
fixed all flaws in the original Convention. The treaty now guarantees appropriate American influence with a
permanent seat on the decision-making body. It eliminates earlier provisions that would have required countries to
share technology. And it generally facilitates access to mining on reasonable commercial terms. With the
modifications enacted in 1994, the treaty now meets all the criteria established by President Reagan in 1982 to
make the treaty in the interest of the United States.
Twelve years ago we missed the opportunity to ratify the treaty in its present form. Our national security, if
anything, is more reliant on worldwide access to the sea and the air on an open and undisputed basis than it was
then.
The Convention of the Law of the Sea is by all lights in our national interest and has earned bipartisan support.
President Bush and his administration have spoken out favorably. The Clinton administration also fully supported
ratification.
We need to convert this important consensus into that simple action of advice and consent in the Senate, thereby
preserving and protecting our national security and other interests embodied in this important treaty.",10,ForeignPolicy,1,,,,,The author calls for the US to join a treaty. ,69,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,32.2203157,35.8318493
"Peters, Ralph",1998,1,2007-07-24,0,0,1,USA Today,Army,,,M,General failure; some of our finest combat leaders have commanded our Troops in Iraq.  Yet they must share the blame for the mess in the Middle East - in large part for their lack of candor. ,"The generals' greatest shortcoming, though, is that they failed in their duty to inform decision makers as to what war means and requires, to give honest advice -- and to keep giving it, even at the cost of their careers. ","There is only one test for a generation of generals: Did the men with stars on their shoulders win or lose their war? No matter the mitigating circumstances and political restrictions military leaders face, there is no ""gentleman's C"" in warfare. The course is pass- fail.

Despite including many fine combat commanders, our military leadership could fail in Iraq, defeated by terrorists, rough-hewn insurgents and shabby militiamen who understood America's limitations better than the generals did.

The generals point out that they don't control the strategic decisions, that all they can do is to follow orders, that then- secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld wouldn't listen to anyone, that Congress undercut the military, that the media's behavior has been pernicious, and that Iraq's political leaders have failed their country.

Each claim is true. Even so, as the Army taught me, ""The maximum effective range of an excuse is zero meters."" Our generals must shoulder their share of the blame for the mess in Iraq.

An ability to disagree

Our current system of selecting generals produces George Pattons in bulk. But it hasn't produced another George Marshall, the general who had the ethical force to disagree -- respectfully -- with his president when victory was at stake.

Decades of observation of our generals taught me that battlefield lions turn to jellyfish in Washington. Our elected leaders, ever fewer of whom have served in uniform, do not get frank, direct and routine military advice.

Sixty years of misguided ""reforms"" emplaced multiple buffers between the president and his top generals. Given the number of White House gatekeepers today, the relationship that Gen. Marshall had with FDR would be impossible -- unless the president wanted it, which today's presidents don't.

For their part, the generals are happy when left to their sandbox. In February 2003, when then-Army chief of staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, an honorable soldier, told the truth when asked how many troops an occupation of Iraq would require (hundreds of thousands), Rumsfeld sidelined him. (Thereafter, Rumsfeld took care to appoint weaker men to the Joint Chiefs.)

Retired from the Army and writing newspaper columns, I received no end of personal messages from officers who shared Shinseki's views. But not one of those who believed that Shinseki was right stood up to be counted.

When Gen. Tommy Franks failed to stand up to Rumsfeld and his ideology-driven deputies over professional issues as we prepared for war, I again heard endless complaints. Yet, even when Franks appeared to lose all interest in his mission, no fellow general called for his removal.

When Gen. Ricardo Sanchez -- a deer caught in the headlights of history -- made one fateful blunder after another as our senior commander in Baghdad, no generals insisted on his removal. Even now, when you ask another general about Sanchez, you get the Manchurian-candidate answer: ""Rick Sanchez is one of the finest officers I've ever known.""

We expected generals who would not police their own ranks to police Iraq.

A bold Army lieutenant colonel, Paul Yingling, recently published an article in Armed Forces Journal pointing out that a soldier who loses a rifle suffers a greater penalty than a general who loses a war. Yingling also suggests that many mid-level officers have lost confidence in their senior leaders.

The generals dismissed him, claiming that the Iraq veteran lacked their perspective.

Yet, who is more apt to have an accurate view of a conflict, the midlevel officer out in the streets, or the general in his air- conditioned office? That lieutenant colonel's article -- admittedly couched in extremes -- reflected what I've heard from hands-on officers for years. Insulated by staff sycophants, the generals are in denial (a humble general is as rare as a bashful porn star).

Our generals are members of a private club whose cardinal rule is that one general never criticizes another publicly. (Incest is OK, though. It always irked my peers and me that the general's aide was inevitably another general's son.) When a half-dozen retired generals belatedly criticized Rumsfeld's ghastly management of the war in 2006, the mass of generals closed ranks against them. It was fine for retired generals to do PR for defense contractors, but when a few spoke out against a disastrous policy, they were ostracized.

Country before career

The generals' greatest shortcoming, though, is that they failed in their duty to inform decision-makers as to what war means and requires, to give honest advice -- and to keep on giving it, even at the cost of their careers.

A recent experience brought this point home painfully. In the course of a private discussion with a general who had performed brilliantly in combat, he blurted out that ""Iraq is over. ... I'm worried about the Army after Iraq.""

I was so startled that I failed to ask him the obvious questions: If he believes Iraq is lost, how can he remain silent as our soldiers continue to die? And why doesn't he share his conclusion with civilian decision-makers?

The tragedy -- and travesty -- is that we finally have a competent chain of command in Iraq. Gen. David Petraeus is doing the tough but necessary things that should've been done in 2003 and 2004. His immediate subordinates, Lt. Gens. Martin Dempsey and Ray Odierno, are remarkably effective officers and men of integrity. We have the best lineup of division commanders -- the two-stars -- we've ever had. Our troops are making meaningful progress on the ground.

War finally sorted the good generals from the bad.

But it could be too late. Congress might find the votes to pull the plug. And this generation of generals will face the verdict of history.",5,CivMilBalance,,,,,,,69,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,32.2203157,35.8318493
"Clark, Wesley and Raustiala, Kal",2000,1,2007-08-08,0,0,1,NYT,Army,,,M,Why Terrorists Aren't Soldiers,"Cases like this illustrate that in the years since 9/11, the Bush administration's approach to terrorism has created more problems than it has solved. We need to recognize that terrorists, while dangerous, are more like modern-day pirates than warriors. They ought to be pursued, tried and convicted in the courts. At the extreme, yes, military force may be required. But the terrorists themselves are not ''combatants.'' They are merely criminals, albeit criminals of an especially heinous type, and that label suggests the appropriate venue for dealing with the threats they pose.","THE line between soldier and civilian has long been central to the law of war. Today that line is being blurred in the struggle against transnational terrorists. Since 9/11 the Bush administration has sought to categorize members of Al Qaeda and other jihadists as ''unlawful combatants'' rather than treat them as criminals.

The federal courts are increasingly wary of this approach, and rightly so. In a stinging rebuke, this summer a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., struck down the government's indefinite detention of a civilian, Ali al-Marri, by the military. The case illustrates once again the pitfalls of our current approach.



Treating terrorists as combatants is a mistake for two reasons. First, it dignifies criminality by according terrorist killers the status of soldiers. Under the law of war, military service members receive several privileges. They are permitted to kill the enemy and are immune from prosecution for doing so. They must, however, carefully distinguish between combatant and civilian and ensure that harm to civilians is limited.

Critics have rightly pointed out that traditional categories of combatant and civilian are muddled in a struggle against terrorists. In a traditional war, combatants and civilians are relatively easy to distinguish. The 9/11 hijackers, by contrast, dressed in ordinary clothes and hid their weapons. They acted not as citizens of Saudi Arabia, an ally of America, but as members of Al Qaeda, a shadowy transnational network. And their prime targets were innocent civilians.

By treating such terrorists as combatants, however, we accord them a mark of respect and dignify their acts. And we undercut our own efforts against them in the process. Al Qaeda represents no state, nor does it carry out any of a state's responsibilities for the welfare of its citizens. Labeling its members as combatants elevates its cause and gives Al Qaeda an undeserved status.

If we are to defeat terrorists across the globe, we must do everything possible to deny legitimacy to their aims and means, and gain legitimacy for ourselves. As a result, terrorism should be fought first with information exchanges and law enforcement, then with more effective domestic security measures. Only as a last resort should we call on the military and label such activities ''war.'' The formula for defeating terrorism is well known and time-proven.

Labeling terrorists as combatants also leads to this paradox: while the deliberate killing of civilians is never permitted in war, it is legal to target a military installation or asset. Thus the attack by Al Qaeda on the destroyer Cole in Yemen in 2000 would be allowed, as well as attacks on command and control centers like the Pentagon. For all these reasons, the more appropriate designation for terrorists is not ''unlawful combatant'' but the one long used by the United States: criminal.

The second major problem with the approach of the Bush administration is that it endangers our political traditions and our commitment to liberty, and further damages America's legitimacy in the eyes of others. Almost 50 years ago, at the height of the cold war, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the ''deeply rooted and ancient opposition in this country to the extension of military control over civilians.''

A great danger in treating operatives for Al Qaeda as combatants is precisely that its members are not easily distinguished from the population at large. The government wields frightening power when it can designate who is, and who is not, subject to indefinite military detention. The Marri case turned on this issue. Mr. Marri is a legal resident of the United States and a citizen of Qatar; the government contends that he is a sleeper agent of Al Qaeda. For the last four years he has been held as an enemy combatant at the Navy brig in Charleston, S.C.

The federal court held that while the government can arrest and convict civilians, under current law the military cannot seize and detain Mr. Marri. Nor would it necessarily be constitutional to do so, even if Congress expressly authorized the military detention of civilians. At the core of the court's reasoning is the belief that civilians and combatants are distinct. Had Ali al-Marri fought for an enemy nation, military detention would clearly be proper. But because he is accused of being a member of Al Qaeda, and is a citizen of a friendly nation, he should not be treated as a warrior.

Cases like this illustrate that in the years since 9/11, the Bush administration's approach to terrorism has created more problems than it has solved. We need to recognize that terrorists, while dangerous, are more like modern-day pirates than warriors. They ought to be pursued, tried and convicted in the courts. At the extreme, yes, military force may be required. But the terrorists themselves are not ''combatants.'' They are merely criminals, albeit criminals of an especially heinous type, and that label suggests the appropriate venue for dealing with the threats they pose.

We train our soldiers to respect the line between combatant and civilian. Our political leaders must also respect this distinction, lest we unwittingly endanger the values for which we are fighting, and further compromise our efforts to strengthen our security.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,69,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,32.2203157,35.8318493

Yes, there have been lies and mistakes and bad decisions in Iraq and Afghanistan -- just as there have been in every war.","BY now, most Americans know the story of Cpl. Pat Tillman. He bravely chose military service rather than the
National Football League, and he was killed in Afghanistan in 2004 by fire from his comrades.
My own units in Vietnam were occasionally the victims of errant rifle fire, mortar rounds and bombs -- indeed, the
very success of an infantry attack is dependent on leaning forward into friendly supporting fires.
But, after the fact, the Tillman death played out differently. His unit reported that he was killed in a ferocious
engagement with the enemy, and the truth was hidden by the chain of command until, as is almost always the case,
the truth escaped. As has been proved repeatedly, bad news doesn't get any better with age. Lt. Gen. Philip R.
Kensinger Jr., who was responsible for the cover-up, has been censured and faces demotion.
Sadly, Corporal Tillman's death comes with another unhappy legacy: a ludicrous change in the Army regulation
that deals with reporting casualties. With this change, the Army now requires a formal, independent investigation
into the death of every American in a hostile area.
If this provision had been in place when we began our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, there would have been
about 3,700 investigations by now. The American losses in Vietnam would have required more than 58,000
inquiries. And if the regulation had existed in World War II, we would have conducted 400,000 investigations,
requiring perhaps as many investigating officers as we now have troops in Iraq.
In theory, the rule sounds commendable. Life is precious, and if one is cut short in combat then we owe the soldier
and his family as full a report as possible. Having experienced more than enough combat, I understand this
sentiment. Unfortunately, I don't think it's the motivating force behind the revised regulation. In my view, the
provision is there for one reason and one reason alone: to put in place a protocol to prevent commanders from lying
about the cause of their soldiers' deaths.
What's the problem with that? Well, it's beyond insidious because it is an admission that the Army has determined
it can't trust anyone in the combat chain of command -- that the actions of General Kensinger are the rule, not the
exception, and that this kind of malfeasance among soldiers is expected to be so common that it requires regular
policing. This is a catastrophic message to be sending our military, in large measure because it is wrong.
In many walks of life, legislating against unacceptable behavior is used as a barrier against potential misdeeds,
but in most cases such laws and rules are really just substitutes for good leadership. To conclude that the Army
needs to legislate honesty is a knee-jerk response to the stupidity of a very few -- a mindless judgment perpetrated
by officials who have little idea of military life. That the Army's uniformed leadership was complicit in creating the
new regulation is all the more galling.

","FOR more than a year, men and women in our armed forces have been urging the United States to bring to safety
the Iraqi translators and others who have worked beside them and are now the victims of retaliation. A Marine
captain, Zachary Iscol, said he owed his life and the lives of his men to his Iraqi translator. ''Just coming to work
was an act of heroism and courage on his part,'' Captain Iscol said.
On July 7, the administration received another urgent call to action on this issue, this time from Ambassador Ryan
Crocker. In a cable to Washington, he laid out the dangers his Iraqi employees faced. ''Just last week we recovered
and identified the bodies of two ... who were kidnapped in May,'' he wrote. Mr. Crocker wanted to be able to assure
the Iraqis on his staff that they had some hope of receiving refuge in the United States.
It is shameful that more than four years into this war, Iraqis working at our embassy cannot count on the United
States to protect them or to help them find a new home when their work with us has made it impossible to survive in
their own country.
Similarly, it is both cruel and foolish for the United States to ignore the plight of more than two million others who
have fled and are struggling to survive in Syria and Jordan. The United States pledge this week of $30 million to
help educate Iraqi refugees in the region is dwarfed by the need.
Dealing with the refugee crisis is vital to the national security of the United States. Continuing indifference to
suffering that we had a strong hand in causing will turn our Muslim supporters against us. More important, it
repudiates the fundamental values of our country and costs Iraqis their lives.
The administration has promised to resettle 7,000 Iraqi refugees by September. By the beginning of August, it had
brought in just 190. Jordan has taken in some 700,000 Iraqi refugees -- equivalent to more than 10 percent of its
own population. Syria has taken in more than 1.2 million, and significant numbers are in Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey,
Iran and the Persian Gulf states. Unlike the United States, none of these countries are well prepared to integrate
refugees. Sectarian fighting has paralyzed the Lebanese government, Jordan is water poor, and Syria struggles
with a poor economy and high unemployment. At a recent conference in the region, these countries pleaded for
international help to deal with the crisis.
So while tiny Jordan struggles to cope with 700,000 refugees, the United States will not meet a goal of only 7,000.
The United States is sending a clear message to the refugees and the countries sheltering them: you are on your
own.
Page 2 of 3
Abandoned at the Border
Without serious American or other international support, a downward spiral is beginning for the refugees and the
Middle East. In Jordan, the cost of living has doubled for all residents, leading to sharp resentment against both the
Iraqis and the government. In turn, the Jordanian government has denied most Iraqi refugees the right to work and
restricted their access to health care.
Syria, one of the last countries to keep its borders open to the Iraqis, has suggested it cannot continue to do so
much longer without some kind of international support. Social services there are collapsing, and poverty has driven
many refugees toward desperation.
This strain could all have a terribly destabilizing effect on the Middle East. This year, for the first time, the
Jordanian government is giving Iraqi children access to public education -- which means keeping 30 schools open
for double shifts. By some estimates, half a million Iraqi refugee children are now out of school, and some have
missed up to three years of their education. In a region where Al Qaeda is becoming a franchise, ensuring that
these children can go to school is as vital to regional security as fighting insurgents in Iraq.
As September comes with no sign of progress in Iraq, momentum is finally building in Congress for a new

"McCain, John and Lieberman, Joe",,0,2007-09-10,0,0,1,WSJ,Navy,,,M,Listening to Petraeus,"The Bush administration clung for too long to a flawed strategy in this war, despite growing evidence of its failure. Now advocates of withdrawal risk making the exact same mistake, by refusing to re- examine their own conviction that Gen. Petraeus's strategy cannot succeed and that the war is ""lost,"" despite rising evidence to the contrary.","Today, Gen. David Petraeus -- commander of our forces in Iraq -- returns to Washington to report on the war in Iraq and the new counterinsurgency strategy he has been implementing there. We hope that opponents of the war in Congress will listen carefully to the evidence that the U.S. military is at last making real and significant progress in its offensive against al Qaeda in Iraq.

Consider how the situation has changed. A year ago, al Qaeda in Iraq controlled large swaths of the country's territory. Today it is being driven out of its former strongholds in Anbar and Diyala provinces by the surge in U.S. forces and those of our Iraqi allies. A year ago, sectarian violence was spiraling out of control in Iraq, fanned by al Qaeda. Today civilian murders in Baghdad are down over 50%.

As facts on the ground in Iraq have improved, some critics of the war have changed their stance. As Democratic Congressman Brian Baird, who voted against the invasion of Iraq, recently wrote after returning from Baghdad: ""[T]he people, strategies, and facts on the ground have changed for the better, and those changes justify changing our position on what should be done.""

Unfortunately, many more antiwar advocates continue to press for withdrawal. Confronted by undeniable evidence of gains against al Qaeda in Iraq, they acknowledge progress but have seized on the performance of the Iraqi government to justify stripping Gen. Petraeus of troops and derailing his strategy.

This reasoning is flawed for several reasons.

First, whatever you think of the performance of Iraq's national leaders, the notion that withdrawing U.S. troops will ""shock"" them into reconciliation is unsupported by evidence or experience. On the contrary, ordering a retreat will only serve to unravel the hard- fought gains we have won.

The recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq was unequivocal on this point: ""Changing the mission of Coalition forces from a primarily counterinsurgency and stabilization role"" -- the Petraeus strategy -- ""to a primary combat support role for Iraqi forces and counterterrorist operations"" -- which most congressional Democrats have been pressing for -- ""would erode security gains achieved thus far.""

This judgment is echoed by our commanders on the ground. Consider the words of Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, who is leading the fight in central Iraq: ""In my battlespace right now, if soldiers were to leave . . . having fought hard for that terrain, having denied the enemy their sanctuaries, what happens is, the enemy would come back.""

In addition, while critics are right that improved security has not yet translated into sufficient political progress at the national level, the increased presence of our soldiers is having a seismic effect on Iraq's politics at the local level.

In the neighborhoods and villages where U.S. forces have moved in, extremists have been marginalized, and moderates empowered. Thanks to this changed security calculus, the Sunni Arab community -- which was largely synonymous with the insurgency a year ago -- has been turning against al Qaeda from the bottom-up, and beginning to negotiate an accommodation with the emerging political order. Sustaining this political shift depends on staying the offensive against al Qaeda -- which in turn depends on not stripping Gen. Petraeus of the manpower he and his commanders say they need.

We must also recognize that the choice we face in Iraq is not between the current Iraqi government and a perfect Iraqi government. Rather, it is a choice between a young, imperfect, struggling democracy that we have helped midwife into existence, and the fanatical, al Qaeda suicide bombers and Iranian-sponsored terrorists who are trying to destroy it. If Washington politicians succeed in forcing a premature troop withdrawal in Iraq, the result will be a more dangerous world with our enemies emboldened. As Iran's president recently crowed, ""soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region . . . [and] we are prepared to fill the gap.""

Whatever the shortcomings of our friends in Iraq, they are no excuse for us to retreat from our enemies like al Qaeda and Iran, who pose a mortal threat to our vital national interests. We must understand that today in Iraq we are fighting and defeating the same terrorist network that attacked on 9/11. As al Qaeda in Iraq continues to be hunted down and rooted out, and the Iraqi Army continues to improve, the U.S. footprint will no doubt adjust. But these adjustments should be left to the discretion of Gen. Petraeus, not forced on our troops by politicians in Washington with a 6,000-mile congressional screwdriver, and, perhaps, an eye on the 2008 election.

The Bush administration clung for too long to a flawed strategy in this war, despite growing evidence of its failure. Now advocates of withdrawal risk making the exact same mistake, by refusing to re- examine their own conviction that Gen. Petraeus's strategy cannot succeed and that the war is ""lost,"" despite rising evidence to the contrary.

The Bush administration finally had the courage to change course in Iraq earlier this year. After hearing from Gen. Petraeus today, we hope congressional opponents of the war will do the same.",6,Warfighting,,,,,1,,69,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,32.2203157,35.8318493
"Willbanks, James",,0,2008-03-05,0,1,1,NYT,Army,,,M,"Winning the Battle, Losing the War","Gen. David Petraeus, commander of coalition forces in Iraq, is a student of the Vietnam War whose doctoral dissertation at Princeton was titled ''The American Military and the Lessons of Vietnam.'' Clearly, he internalized those lessons, because in discussing the surge and the progress of the war in Iraq he has studiously avoided building undue expectations and has repeatedly said that there will be tough times ahead. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was likewise careful in his recent comments about re-evaluating troop reduction plans this summer. The wisdom of their approach will become especially evident if insurgents in Iraq engage in any Tet-like offensive this year -- especially with a presidential election looming and the future of the American military commitment in Iraq hanging in the balance.","THIS winter is the 40th anniversary of the Tet offensive, which proved to be the turning point of the Vietnam War. By the time it was over, the American strategy in Vietnam switched from pursuing victory on the battlefield to finding a way to disengage. It is instructive to recall that the American and allied armies actually turned back the attackers and inflicted heavy casualties.



In the latter months of 1967, after more than two years of bitter fighting in Vietnam, many Americans believed that the war had degenerated into a bloody stalemate. Gen. William Westmoreland, the senior commander, did not see it that way; by his primary metric -- the body count -- American and allied forces were making significant headway. Under criticism by the growing antiwar movement at home, President Lyndon Johnson decided to make General Westmoreland's optimism the focal point of an information campaign to convince the American people that we were winning the war.

In mid-November 1967, he brought the general home to make the case. Upon arriving at Andrews Air Force Base, General Westmoreland told waiting reporters that he was ''very, very encouraged'' by recent events. At an appearance on ''Meet the Press'' two days later, he said American troops would be able to begin withdrawing ''within two years or less.'' During an address at the National Press Club, he claimed that ''we have reached an important point where the end begins to come into view.'' He consistently gave an upbeat account of how things were going in the war, clearly believing that a corner had been turned.

Even as Westmoreland spoke, however, the Communists in Vietnam were preparing a countrywide offensive designed to ''liberate'' South Vietnam, which was set to begin at the start of Tet, the lunar new year.

In the early morning hours of Jan. 31, 1968, Communist forces struck suddenly and with a fury breathtaking in scope. More than 80,000 soldiers from the North Vietnamese Army and the Vietcong guerrilla force launched nearly simultaneous attacks against major cities, towns and military installations from the Demilitarized Zone south to the Mekong Delta. They attacked 36 of 44 provincial capitals, five of the six major cities and 64 district capitals. They seized and occupied Hue, the ancient imperial capital, and sent 11 battalions into Saigon to strike six targets, including the United States Embassy.

With a few notable exceptions -- at Hue, Khe Sanh and Cholon -- most of the fighting of the opening phase of the offensive was over in a few days as the American and South Vietnamese forces overcame the initial surprise and responded with superior firepower. The citizen uprising that the Communists had been counting on failed to materialize. The Communists suffered horrendous casualties; some estimates ranged as high as 40,000 killed. Their losses continued to grow as subsequent fighting extended into the fall months. By the time the offensive had run its course, the Vietcong had been crippled; the major fighting for the rest of the war would be done by the North Vietnamese Army.

The Americans had won a tactical victory. But the sheer scope and ferocity of the offensive and the vivid images of the fighting on the nightly television news convinced many Americans that the Johnson administration had lied to them, and the president's credibility plummeted. Perhaps more important, the offensive shook the administration's own confidence and led to a re-evaluation of American strategy. When General Westmoreland asked for an additional 206,000 troops to ''take advantage of the situation,'' the president balked.

On March 31, 1968, Johnson went on national television to announce a partial suspension of the bombing campaign against North Vietnam and call for negotiations. He then stunned the audience by announcing that he would not run for re-election. The following year, President Richard Nixon began the long American withdrawal from Vietnam, paving the way for the triumph of the Communist forces in 1975.

Historians are often reluctant to draw comparisons between historical events, and this has been especially true for Vietnam and Iraq, because the two wars have more differences than similarities. That being said, however, American military actions today can be informed by one general lesson from the Tet offensive, and that is the importance of not putting the best face on a military situation for political reasons.

To dampen antiwar sentiment, Johnson and Westmoreland encouraged what turned out to be false expectations about our prospects in Vietnam, and this colored Americans' perception of the Tet offensive, stretching the president's credibility gap to the breaking point. A tactical victory became a strategic defeat and led to the virtual abdication of President Johnson. General Tran Do of North Vietnam acknowledged that the offensive failed to achieve its objectives, but noted that the public reaction in the United States was ''a fortunate result.''

Gen. David Petraeus, commander of coalition forces in Iraq, is a student of the Vietnam War whose doctoral dissertation at Princeton was titled ''The American Military and the Lessons of Vietnam.'' Clearly, he internalized those lessons, because in discussing the surge and the progress of the war in Iraq he has studiously avoided building undue expectations and has repeatedly said that there will be tough times ahead. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was likewise careful in his recent comments about re-evaluating troop reduction plans this summer. The wisdom of their approach will become especially evident if insurgents in Iraq engage in any Tet-like offensive this year -- especially with a presidential election looming and the future of the American military commitment in Iraq hanging in the balance.",5,Warfighting,,,,,,,71,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,32.2203157,35.8318493

And we know that young people who live in countries where they feel disenfranchised and without hope are prime recruiting targets for our adversaries.","As voters consider their choices for president, much is already weighing on their minds: talk about a U.S. recession, lack of affordable health care, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But another concern should be front and center -- the candidates' vision for a better, safer America and world.

Our experience, both in and out of uniform, leads us to make a direct, personal appeal to all the presidential candidates that what the U.S. urgently needs is a new and vibrant strategic agenda for its national security and foreign policy. The reality is that many of the threats we face today -- illegal immigration, radical jihadism and terrorism, public health and environmental problems -- originate from complicated circumstances beyond our borders. And we know that young people who live in countries where they feel disenfranchised and without hope are prime recruiting targets for our adversaries.

We cannot inoculate our nation from these threats. Instead, we must address the roots of these complex problems. Simply put, it is time to repair our relationship with the world and begin to take it to the nextlevel -- a level defined not only by our military strength, but also by the lives we save and the opportunities we create for the people of other nations. We call upon the next president to elevate the use of tools such as development assistance and diplomacy as integral parts of our national security strategy.

'A new commitment'

Whether it's taking the lead in increasing funding for and using innovation to expand access to potable water in the Middle East, decreasing rates of HIV/AIDS in Africa and Southeast Asia, building international partnerships to put impoverished kids in school or addressing climate change, the next administration must reframe and restructure our foreign policy and national security architecture. We must match our military might with a new commitment to investing in improving people's lives overseas.

Why would two retired military officers, a Marine and a Navy attack pilot, support increased investment in these non-military tools? Because we understand that the U.S. cannot rely on military power alone to keep us safe from terrorism, infectious disease and other global threats that recognize no borders.

The next commander in chief must be ready at the start of his or her administration to articulate a comprehensive strategy for how America is going to chart a new course by elevating the use of our non-military tools, followed by hard commitments of people and resources to the task. He or she must be ready to do what any military commander would do going into battle: Make sure your troops understand the mission and its importance and then work to execute the plan.

Today's battle for peace requires the same seamless coordination, and the troops the next president must prepare include Defense, State, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the National Security Council.

An example of a country where greater investments in development are making a difference to our security is Yemen. It's one of the least developed countries in the world and a ripe recruiting ground for terrorists. Today, U.S. aid programs are building health clinics there, supplying medical equipment, training midwives and doctors to improve pre- and post-natal care, and expanding counseling services and health education to rural areas. Increased efforts such as these will help mitigate the extreme poverty and accompanying hopelessness that often fuel terrorist recruitment.

Or consider Liberia, where, after decades of conflict, development assistance is reintegrating and revitalizing communities by accelerating learning opportunities for ex-combatant and non-combatant youth,creating jobs through microcredit and small enterprise initiatives -- and promoting human rights.

In both countries, significant non-military investments help mitigate societal discontent, which promotes stability internally with the potential to remove destabilizing influences in the surrounding regions.

Truman's lead

Such leadership and shift in strategy are not without precedent. President Harry Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 to realign the U.S. armed forces, foreign policy and intelligence community apparatus after World War II. This act and the changes that followed were instrumental in helping presidents from Truman to Ronald Reagan devise and implement strategies to deal with the Cold War threats of the time.

Both of us entered service to our country in the Cold War era, when strategic threats were more easily defined. Today, our ""enemies"" are often conditions -- poverty, infectious disease, political instability and corruption, global warming -- which generate the biggest threats. By addressing them in meaningful ways, we can forestall crises.

The great Chinese military general and strategist Sun Tze got it right in sixth century B.C. when he said, ""The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."" We urge our next commander in chief to accept this sage advice. The American people should expect nothing less.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,71,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,32.2203157,35.8318493

seemingly clever combination of the use of ""sticks"" and ""carrots,"" including the frequent official hints of an American
military option ""remaining on the table,"" simply intensifies Iran's desire to have its own nuclear arsenal. Alas, such a
heavy-handed ""sticks"" and ""carrots"" policy may work with donkeys but not with serious countries. The United States
would have a better chance of success if the White House abandoned its threats of military action and its calls for
regime change.
Consider countries that could have quickly become nuclear weapon states had they been treated similarly. Brazil,
Argentina and South Africa had nuclear weapons programs but gave them up, each for different reasons. Had the
United States threatened to change their regimes if they would not, probably none would have complied. But when
""sticks"" and ""carrots"" failed to prevent India and Pakistan from acquiring nuclear weapons, the United States
rapidly accommodated both, preferring good relations with them to hostile ones. What does this suggest to leaders
in Iran?
To look at the issue another way, imagine if China, a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a country
that has deliberately not engaged in a nuclear arms race with Russia or the United States, threatened to change the
American regime if it did not begin a steady destruction of its nuclear arsenal. The threat would have an arguable
legal basis, because all treaty signatories promised long ago to reduce their arsenals, eventually to zero. The
American reaction, of course, would be explosive public opposition to such a demand. U.S. leaders might even
mimic the fantasy rhetoric of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad regarding the use of nuclear weapons.
A successful approach to Iran has to accommodate its security interests and ours. Neither a U.S. air attack on
Iranian nuclear facilities nor a less effective Israeli one could do more than merely set back Iran's nuclear program.
In either case, the United States would be held accountable and would have to pay the price resulting from likely
Iranian reactions. These would almost certainly involve destabilizing the Middle East, as well as Afghanistan, and
serious efforts to disrupt the flow of oil, at the very least generating a massive increase in its already high cost. The
turmoil in the Middle East resulting from a preemptive attack on Iran would hurt America and eventually Israel, too.
Given Iran's stated goals -- a nuclear power capability but not nuclear weapons, as well as an alleged desire to
discuss broader U.S.-Iranian security issues -- a realistic policy would exploit this opening to see what it might yield.
Page 2 of 3
A Sensible Path on Iran
The United States could indicate that it is prepared to negotiate, either on the basis of no preconditions by either
side (though retaining the right to terminate the negotiations if Iran remains unyielding but begins to enrich its
uranium beyond levels allowed by the Non-Proliferation Treaty); or to negotiate on the basis of an Iranian
willingness to suspend enrichment in return for simultaneous U.S. suspension of major economic and financial
sanctions.
Such a broader and more flexible approach would increase the prospects of an international arrangement being
devised to accommodate Iran's desire for an autonomous nuclear energy program while minimizing the possibility
that it could be rapidly transformed into a nuclear weapons program. Moreover, there is no credible reason to
assume that the traditional policy of strategic deterrence, which worked so well in U.S. relations with the Soviet
Union and with China and which has helped to stabilize India-Pakistan hostility, would not work in the case of Iran.
The widely propagated notion of a suicidal Iran detonating its very first nuclear weapon against Israel is more the
product of paranoia or demagogy than of serious strategic calculus. It cannot be the basis for U.S. policy, and it
should not be for Israel's, either.
An additional longer-range benefit of such a dramatically different diplomatic approach is that it could help bring Iran
back into its traditional role of strategic cooperation with the United States in stabilizing the Gulf region. Eventually,
Iran could even return to its long-standing and geopolitically natural pre-1979 policy of cooperative relations with
Israel. One should note also in this connection Iranian hostility toward al-Qaeda, lately intensified by al-Qaeda's
Web-based campaign urging a U.S.-Iranian war, which could both weaken what al-Qaeda views as Iran's apostate
Shiite regime and bog America down in a prolonged regional conflict.
Last but not least, consider that American sanctions have been deliberately obstructing Iran's efforts to increase its
oil and natural gas outputs. That has contributed to the rising cost of energy. An eventual American-Iranian
accommodation would significantly increase the flow of Iranian energy to the world market. Americans doubtless
would prefer to pay less for filling their gas tanks than having to pay much more to finance a wider conflict in the
Persian Gulf.",9,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,71,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,32.2203157,35.8318493

I had the very great privilege of leading these sons and daughters of America; that is the Guantanamo I know.","There is much talk in the media, in our capital and elsewhere about the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I have paid close attention to this dialogue, and after a year in command, it is clear that there are two Guantanamos: the one that exists in popular culture, and the one most discover when they actually see conditions there.

We house enemy combatants in one of several facilities according to their compliance with camp rules. Highly compliant detainees, approximately 20% of the population, live in Camp 4. Here they enjoy a communal, barracks-style environment, with movie nights, classes in Pashtu, Arabic and English, shared meals and prayers, and up to 12 hours of recreation per day.

Many of the enemy combatants, however, fail to comply with established rules. Offenses often include head-butting, kicking, biting and splashing young soldiers and sailors with feces and urine ""cocktails.""

These detainees are housed in Camps 5 and 6 -- modern, climate- controlled facilities modeled after existing U.S. prison facilities in the Midwest. They get a minimum of two, soon to be three, hours of outdoor recreation per day adjacent to three to five other detainees. And they are held in a block of single-occupancy cells where they communicate with other detainees, guards, medical staff, library assistants and mail delivery personnel. Prayers are led five times a day by a detainee-appointed Imam. Each cell contains an arrow that points to Mecca.

All detainees receive three-meals per day, a 4,000-calorie diet selected from six different menus which meet the halal cultural dietary requirements, and which provide for special needs such as low sodium, vegetarian or diabetic. We provide comfort items including sheets and bedding, uniforms, shoes, prayer beads, prayer rugs, toiletries and bottled water. Each detainee is issued a Quran in Arabic and one in his native language. An ever-expanding, 5,000 volume library is available for a weekly choice of reading material.

Detainees sent and received more than 27,000 pieces of mail last year. In addition to humanitarian phone calls, which have long been permitted, we allow annual phone calls to family members. Last year, more than 1,200 attorney visits were conducted. Suggestions that detainees are being held ""incommunicado"" are simply not true.

Medical care standards afforded to detainees are the same that my troopers receive. Access to treatment is 24/7, with a detainee-to- medical-staff ratio of three-to-one that far exceeds Federal Bureau of Prison standards, and is frankly better than what most Americans enjoy.

Joint Task Force doctors have performed more than 370 surgeries, including restorative eye procedures, and a recent back surgery that restored movement and avoided possible paralysis for a detainee. Shortly after, that detainee sent me a note saying ""Thank you, I have been wrong about Americans.""

Our mental health facility, staffed by a variety of mental health- care professionals, includes a psychiatrist and a psychologist. Approximately 15% of our detainees are seen for such issues on a regular basis, about half the average experienced in the U.S. prison population.

We enjoy a very positive relationship with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Its professionals have access to all detainees and facilities, and they provide us with useful and supportive confidential comments and suggestions -- which have helped in furthering the development of our detention programs.

An important part of the Guantanamo story routinely underreported by many in the media -- but readily apparent to most who visit -- is the dedication and professionalism exhibited every single day by the more than 2,200 soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and civilians who provide for the safe and humane care and custody of very dangerous men.

It is in the mutual interest of the United States and Iraq to continue the transition to Iraqi forces and the drawdown of American troops in circumstances most likely to provide for stability. Certainly there is some risk involved. But the opportunity is unprecedented and the potential vast.,"THE prospect of a long-term security arrangement between the United States and Iraq has become a lightning rod
for criticism. Yet such an agreement -- which the White House believes could be completed this month now that the
two countries have agreed to set a ''general time horizon'' for reducing the number of American troops in Iraq --
would be in the best interests of the governments of both countries, and of the people who live in a region of the
world that urgently needs stability.
The United Nations Security Council resolution that authorizes coalition operations in Iraq expires at the end of this
year. But the calendar is not the most important reason for the United States to enter into a long-term pact with Iraq.
The opportunity presented by the improved situation on the ground begs to be exploited lest it disappear in the
ever-shifting sands of Middle East strife.
Are the desires of the American people and the Iraqi people different? I don't think so. During my year in command
of all American forces in the Middle East, I met often with Iraqis of all walks of life. Discussions with people -- from
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to clerics, governors and generals to men in the streets of Baghdad and towns
and cities throughout the country -- left me with several strong impressions. The top objective of both countries is
security and stability in the region. Letting Iraq's security forces assume responsibility for their country is another
mutual goal. Withdrawing the vast majority of American and coalition troops from Iraq as soon as possible is a clear
priority.
Why is achieving these aims so difficult? The most significant obstacle is war weariness. The war has dragged on
so long that people are fixated on yesterday's many negative aspects and are not aware of the profoundly different
and improved situation in Iraq today -- which is very different from only a few months ago.
Another major challenge is the continuing tendency to view anything to do with Iraq in the polarizing terms of yes
or no, in or out. The prudent and rational approach is more nuanced, and more likely to achieve both countries'
mutual goals.
There are two key aspects of the bilateral security accord that has been proposed. The first is a status of forces
agreement, which is a detailed compilation of the procedures and legal protections that govern the presence of
foreign troops in another country. The second element is a higher-level strategic framework agreement, in which the
two parties agree on the principles that will guide their mutual actions to create long-term security in Iraq. This more
important part of the accord focuses on major policy issues like the roles and missions for each country's military,
the control of forces in various security situations, procedures for detainees, and the transition of responsibility.
Page 2 of 4
Surge Protector
Objections and objectors to the agreement are numerous. From the American side, we hear that it would tie us to
an open-ended commitment to defend Iraq from external threats; that it would continue to drain resources from a
faltering domestic economy; and that it violates Congressional prerogatives enshrined in the Constitution.
Some Iraqis, meanwhile, complain that any continued American presence in their country perpetuates what they
see as an occupation and an infringement of their national sovereignty. They and other skeptics in the region object
to the potential for long-term military bases, and they denounce America's alleged hegemonic intentions.
And Iran objects to every aspect of continued American-Iraqi cooperation while promoting instability and
supporting attacks on coalition forces in Iraq by providing arms and training to Shiite extremists and criminals.
These objections are obscuring what may be a one-time opportunity to achieve the goals so keenly desired by the
majority of Americans and Iraqis, who care about peace and stability in the world. Most of the concerns involve
worst-case possibilities that play to the fears of the poorly informed. For example, the security accord would define
future commitments rather than perpetuate the perception of an ''open-ended'' engagement. The United States
needs access to bases in Iraq to support the current level of operations. As responsibility for security passes to Iraqi
forces, the need for bases will diminish.
Negotiators can sort through the issues. Given their recent history in Iraq, contractors and their rights and
protections are a controversial topic. But civilian contractors perform a wide range of essential tasks, and the terms
of their future service needs to be included in the agreement. Control of Iraqi airspace is another important
component that will require clearheaded negotiations to preserve our military's ability to ensure the safety of the
many airplanes flying over Iraq and the timeliness of combat air support for troops on the ground.
The benefits that could be achieved are considerable. The agreement could reap dividends similar to those gained
over the past year through the sacrifice and efforts of so many who have carried out an enlightened
counterinsurgency strategy.
The number of incidents of violence nationwide in Iraq is less than a tenth of what we were experiencing in the
spring of 2007. The casualty rate among American troops is the lowest in more than four years and continues to
improve. Ethnic and sectarian violence among the Iraqi population has declined to levels not seen since the early
days of the war.
Iraq's security forces, with only modest coalition support, have demonstrated unprecedented initiative by taking
control and assuming security of previously insurgent-dominated areas like Amara, Basra, Diwaniya and Sadr City.
These actions signal a more confident and capable Iraqi leadership and military.
The government of Prime Minister Maliki has assumed an increasingly large share of the cost of Iraqi security,
paying $3 for each American dollar contributed, and is on track to assume near total responsibility next year as
revenues from oil exports continue to rise. Economic activity in Iraq is accelerating. Major oil companies are signing
development contracts to improve the infrastructure.
The government of Iraq is eager to exert its sovereignty, but its leaders also recognize that it will be some time
before Iraq can take full control of security. They are acutely aware of Iran's behavior and of the need for continued
cooperation with the United States.
This is a pivotal time. The aspirations of the hopeful could come to fruition: a stable Iraq, with a modern oil industry
and substantially increased export capacity, that is part of the growing regional economic and political cooperation
in the Middle East. This is not wishful dreaming but a very real possibility.
But it will happen only if security in Iraq is maintained. And a long-term arrangement with the United States is key
to Iraq's future security.
Reasonable objectors to the security pact, in both countries, must jettison the rhetorical and emotional baggage of
the recent past. Forget the errors and bad decisions and deal with the present. Real progress has been made, and
this positive momentum must be maintained.
Page 3 of 4

Compromise, of course, will be essential. But confidence will be, too. The Americans need to trust Iraq's security
forces, and the Iraqis need to trust America's intentions. The United States must give the Iraqi government an
opportunity to demonstrate sovereignty over its territory while the government of Iraq must recognize its continued,
if diminishing, reliance on the American military.
But the political posturing in pursuit of short-term gains must cease. All interested parties should cooperate for the
general good.
We have come a long way in Iraq. It is in the mutual interest of the United States and Iraq to continue the
transition to Iraqi forces and the drawdown of American troops in circumstances most likely to provide for stability.

"McFarlane, Robert",,0,2008-10-23,0,1,1,NYT,Marine Corps,,,M,From Beirut to 9/11,"First however, we must win in Afghanistan -- truly the decisive battleground in this global struggle…Unless our next president understands the complexity of the challenge as well as what it will take to succeed, and can lead his cabinet and our country in resolute execution of that strategy, we will lose this war. ","IN the summer of 1983, I became President Ronald Reagan's special representative to the Middle East, with the
mission of restoring a measure of calm to Israel's relations with her neighbors, starting with Lebanon. At the time,
Lebanon was occupied by Syrian and Israeli forces -- Syria since shortly after Lebanon's civil war began in 1975,
and Israel since its invasion in June of the previous year.
Scarcely three months into that assignment, however, I was recalled to Washington and named the president's
national security adviser. Just after midnight on Friday, Oct. 21, I was awakened by a call from Vice President
George H. W. Bush, who reported that several East Caribbean states had asked the United States to send forces to
the Caribbean island of Grenada to prevent the Soviet Union and Cuba from establishing a base there. I called the
president and Secretary of State George Shultz, who were on a golfing trip in Augusta, Ga., and received approval
to have our forces prepare to land within 72 hours.
Then, less than 24 hours later I was awakened again, this time by the duty officer at the White House situation
room, who reported that United States Marine barracks in Lebanon had been attacked by Iranian-trained Hezbollah
terrorists with heavy losses. Again, I called the president, and he prepared for an immediate return to Washington to
deal with both crises.
Today is the 25th anniversary of that bombing, which killed 241 Americans who were part of a multinational
peacekeeping force (a simultaneous attack on the French base killed 58 paratroopers). The attack was planned
over several months at Hezbollah's training camp in the Bekaa Valley in central Lebanon. Once American
intelligence confirmed who was responsible and where the attack had been planned, President Reagan approved a
joint French-American air assault on the camp -- only to have the mission aborted just before launching by the
secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger. Four months later, all the marines were withdrawn, capping one of the
most tragic and costly policy defeats in the brief modern history of American counterterrorism operations.
One could draw several conclusions from this episode. To me the most telling was the one reached by Middle
Eastern terrorists, that the United States had neither the will nor the means to respond effectively to a terrorist
attack, a conclusion seemingly borne out by our fecklessness toward terrorist attacks in the 1990s: in 1993 on the
World Trade Center; on Air Force troops at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996; on our embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya in 1998; on the destroyer Cole in 2000.
There was no effective response from the United States to any of these. It was not until the attacks of Sept. 11,
2001, that our country decided to go to war against radical Islam.
A second conclusion concerns the age-old maxim never to deploy a force without giving it a clear military mission.
In 1983, the Marine battalion positioned at the Beirut Airport was assigned the mission of ''presence''; that is, to lend
Page 2 of 3
From Beirut to 9/11
moral support to the fragile Lebanese government. Secretary of State Shultz and I urged the president to give the
marines their traditional role -- to deploy, at the invitation of the Lebanese government, into the mountains alongside
the newly established Lebanese Army in an effort to secure the evacuation of Syrian and Israeli forces from
Lebanon.
Secretary Weinberger disagreed. He felt strongly that American interests in the Middle East lay primarily in the
region's oil, and that to assure access to that oil we ought never to undertake military operations that might result in
Muslim casualties and put at risk Muslim goodwill.
Cabinet officers often disagree, and rigorous debate and refinement often lead to better policy. What is intolerable,
however, is irresolution. In this case the president allowed the refusal by his secretary of defense to carry out a
direct order to go by without comment -- an event which could have seemed to Mr. Weinberger only a vindication of
his judgment. Faced with the persistent refusal of his secretary of defense to countenance a more active role for the
marines, the president withdrew them, sending the terrorists a powerful signal of paralysis within our government
and missing an early opportunity to counter the Islamist terrorist threat in its infancy.
Since 9/11 we have learned a lot about the threat from radical Islam and how to defeat it. Our commitment to Iraq
is now being vindicated and, if sustained, will enable us to establish an example of pluralism in a Muslim state with
a flourishing economy.
First, however, we must win in Afghanistan -- truly the decisive battleground in this global struggle. Never has
there been a greater need for experience and judgment in the White House. Unless our next president understands
the complexity of the challenge as well as what it will take to succeed, and can lead his cabinet and our country in
resolute execution of that strategy, we will lose this war.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,71,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,32.2203157,35.8318493

But we must act: aiding the American automobile industry is not only an economic imperative, but also a national security imperative.

When President Dwight Eisenhower observed that America's greatest strength wasn't its military, but its economy, he must have had companies like General Motors and Ford in mind. Sitting atop a vast pyramid of tool makers, steel producers, fabricators and component manufacturers, these companies not only produced the tanks and trucks that helped win World War II, but also lent their technology to aircraft and ship manufacturing. The United States truly became the arsenal of democracy.

During the 1950s, advances in aviation, missiles, satellites and electronics made Detroit seem a little old-fashioned in dealing with the threat of the Soviet Union. The Army's requests for new trucks and other basic transportation usually came out a loser in budget battles against missile technology and new modifications for the latest supersonic jet fighter. Not only were airplanes far sexier but they also counted as part of our military ""tooth,"" while much of the land forces' needs were ""tail."" And in those days, ""more teeth, less tail"" had become a key concept in military spending.

But in 1991, the Persian Gulf war demonstrated the awesome utility of American land power, and the Humvee (and its civilian version, the Hummer) became a star. Likewise, the ubiquitous homemade bombs of the current Iraq insurgency have led to the development of innovative armor-protected wheeled vehicles for American forces, as well as improvements in our fleets of Humvees, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, trucks and cargo carriers.

In a little more than a year, the Army has procured and fielded in Iraq more than a thousand so-called mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles. The lives of hundreds of soldiers and marines have been saved, and their tasks made more achievable, by the efforts of the American automotive industry. And unlike in World War II, America didn't have to divert much civilian capacity to meet these military needs. Without a vigorous automotive sector, those needs could not have been quickly met.

More challenges lie ahead for our military, and to meet them we need a strong industrial base. For years the military has sought better sources of electric power in its vehicles -- necessary to allow troops to monitor their radios with diesel engines off, to support increasingly high-powered communications technology, and eventually to support electric propulsion and innovative armaments like directed-energy weapons. In sum, this greater use of electricity will increase combat power while reducing our footprint. Much research and development spending has gone into these programs over the years, but nothing on the manufacturing scale we really need.

Now, though, as Detroit moves to plug-in hybrids and electric-drive technology, the scale problem can be remedied. Automakers are developing innovative electric motors, many with permanent magnet technology, that will have immediate military use. And only the auto industry, with its vast purchasing power, is able to establish a domestic advanced battery industry. Likewise, domestic fuel cell production -- which will undoubtedly have many critical military applications -- depends on a vibrant car industry.

To be sure, the public should demand transformation and new standards in the auto industry before paying to keep it alive. And we should insist that Detroit's goals include putting America in first place in hybrid and electric automotive technology, reducing the emissions of the country's transportation fleet, and strengthening our competitiveness abroad.

His administration should view the new status of forces agreement between Washington and Baghdad as a means to shape the withdrawal of our combat forces while maintaining enough leverage to guide Iraq toward a more stable future.","AS a brigade commander in Baghdad in 2003, I befriended a resident, Adnan Abdul Sahib, who went on to serve two terms as the head of the city advisory council. In 2007, however, sectarian violence forced his family from their home in central Baghdad, and they fled the country. Last month I talked with Adnan in Colorado, where he and his family are now refugees. ""The fatal mistake the United States made in Iraq,"" he told me, ""was to empower extreme sectarian political parties. It's time to give the moderates a voice.""

Barack Obama has the opportunity to recast American policy toward Iraq in a meaningful way, by providing much-needed support to its political center. His administration should view the new status of forces agreement between Washington and Baghdad as a means to shape the withdrawal of our combat forces while maintaining enough leverage to guide Iraq toward a more stable future.

The assumption behind the recently concluded military surge was that substantial reductions in ethnic and sectarian violence would lead to progress on political reconciliation. The security situation has improved remarkably, and while political compromise has not followed as swiftly as we hoped, there has been some progress, especially in terms of clarifying the roles and powers of each of the country's 18 provinces and paving the way for provincial elections early next year.

The key now is to sustain the momentum toward reconciliation, even while combat forces are withdrawn -- a delicate balancing act. Although insurgent attacks have been appreciably reduced and Al Qaeda in Iraq is devastated, considerable distrust remains among various ethnic factions and religious sects and within the Iraqi government. As honest brokers, American forces keep the peace in key areas. Yet it is possible that we can complete their departure over three years, as envisioned in the status of forces agreement, assuming that the Iraqi Army has matured enough to take on added responsibilities.

Up to four brigades and their associated support -- 20,000 to 25,000 troops -- could be withdrawn in 2009, which would provide reinforcements for the war in Afghanistan. Withdrawals should then accelerate, as the division of power and resources is cemented locally across Iraq, with half the remaining combat forces and their associated support withdrawn in each of the following two years. By the end of 2011 -- subject to Iraqi concurrence, of course -- some 20,000 to 40,000 troops would remain for an extended period. These would be mainly military advisers, counterterrorist units, combat aircraft crews and support, and intelligence and logistical personnel.

Much of the stability in Iraq stems from a patchwork of agreements across the country between local leaders and the American military or the Iraqi government. To make sure that these agreements endure, the Iraqi government needs to prove to its people that it represents their interests in these ways: by ensuring adequate representation in political life of all sects and ethnicities in the political life; by incorporating a significant number of the Sons of Iraq (Sunnis who have supported the counterinsurgency) into the police forces and other government jobs; by providing tangible incentives for the return of Iraqi refugees from abroad; and by equitably distributing government funds and services to all areas of Iraq.

In this light, the provincial and national elections next year are crucial to the way ahead. That Sunni Arabs and several nonsectarian parties have decided to take part promises a more broadly representative and legitimate government. It is in the interest of both Iraq and the United States to see these elections held in a free, fair and transparent manner.

Even as we pull troops out, the United States is not without significant leverage. We provide the Iraqi armed forces needed assets, from intelligence and logistics to air support and advisers; our civilian advisers are helping to improve the efficiency of the Iraqi government; our global diplomatic leverage can help Iraq in a number of ways; and Washington can encourage business investment in Iraq, particularly in its dilapidated oil industry.

To nudge the Iraqi government in the right direction, the new administration must let it know, quietly but firmly, that the blank check given by the Bush administration is no longer in force. It should make clear that we, too, want to see the expeditious withdrawal of American combat forces, but only in a manner that ensures Iraq will not again dissolve into chaos and civil war. Long-term American diplomatic, economic and military support should be contingent on a comprehensive political solution with a fair division of power. The alternative -- a sectarian Shiite government that marginalizes other sects and ethnicities and is perhaps aligned with Iran as well -- is unacceptable.",6,Warfighting,,,,,,,71,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,27.3228794,42.1971093
"Owens, William",1996,1,2008-12-21,0,1,1,NYT,Navy,,,M,A Lean War Machine,"We must eliminate the unjustified excesses of the military-industrial complex, the dangerous reticence in meeting the real challenges of the 21st century, and the inertia within the national security establishment. ","CAN Barack Obama afford to keep the Defense Department's budget at the extraordinary levels of the last seven
years? With the spreading recession, the answer is no. Can he make cuts without jeopardizing national security and
the safety of our troops? The answer is yes -- but only if we demand that contractors, the four services and
lawmakers make their own interests a lower priority and build a stronger military based on joint-service cooperation
and real innovation.
In 2008, the United States has spent nearly $700 billion on defense. That is more than twice as much as the next
five militaries in the world combined. Half-a-trillion dollars went to the Pentagon's ''base budget'' and $180 billion
more paid for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even if both conflicts ended today, we would face continuing war
costs, including those to replace equipment and tend to the wounded.
The American war machine that swept away the Saddam Hussein regime was built during the eight years of the
Clinton presidency for about $300 billion a year (adjusted for inflation). George W. Bush added more than a trillion
dollars over the past eight years, not including money that went to Afghanistan and Iraq.
Some may argue defense spending is just what we need in a recession, pointing to how the United States spent
itself out of the Great Depression to fight World War II. But our economy has changed fundamentally since then,
moving from an industrial base to a service and information base. And unlike in 1942, the American military today
is already vastly superior to any other.
The claim that continuing extraordinary military expenditures are good for the economy is false. There are much
better Main Street investments to end the recession around (public works and education, to name a couple). There
is no need to keep military spending level -- the money is going largely to maintain a military that is increasingly less
effective in meeting future security challenges, and hundreds of millions of dollars are squandered because of
inefficiency, poor budgeting and greed.
The saddest thing about this is that the Pentagon tends to make cuts by trying to stretch and shave existing
programs. What President Dwight D. Eisenhower called the ''military-industrial complex'' is resurgent, this time
driven by defense contractors. Their myopic drive to assure quarterly profits stifles innovation. And little changes
because they wield inordinate influence through contracts in nearly every Congressional district.
There is a better way, one that turns the necessity of cost reductions into a military more suited to the national
security challenges we will face down the road. We need to realize the principles of what military planners called
the ''revolution of military affairs'' of the mid-1990s. To do so calls for innovations in three areas: first, a joint-service
perspective that emphasizes the interdependence of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps; second,

investment that focuses on cutting-edge information technology systems that allow our forces to work together more
effectively, rather than more spending on the complex and expensive major weapons systems of the past; and last,
changes in the way the Pentagon goes about assessing its needs and contracting.
''Jointness'' can reduce redundancies: by acting separately, the services needlessly duplicate one another's
efforts in logistics, communications, intelligence, medical services and administration -- not to mention several
areas of war-fighting. Because each service operates its bases independently, we have far too many. Consolidating
them into ''megabases'' would make for greater effectiveness and save tens of billions. Likewise, an emphasis on
information technology can increase the strength of the force while it reduces the need for manpower, the single
most expensive aspect of today's military.
We must eliminate the unjustified excesses of the military-industrial complex, the dangerous reticence in meeting
the real challenges of the 21st century, and the inertia within the national security establishment. By restarting the
revolution in military affairs, we can better support our national security and the men and women in our military, who
deserve the very best that money can buy.",10,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,71,110,2007,0.807651809,0.687637647,27.3228794,42.1971093

Rather than go through what promised to be a painful and distracting public confirmation process, Phil Mudd withdrew his name from consideration to be the undersecretary of homeland security for intelligence and analysis. If he had been confirmed, Phil would have followed the iconic figure of Charlie Allen, another CIA veteran, in a post charged with some of the most important work in the American intelligence community -- being a key interface between national capabilities and the needs of our state and local defenders and first responders.

Phil Mudd is a thoroughgoing intelligence professional, a career CIA analyst with superb credentials and extensive experience in the counterterrorism mission. As deputy director of national intelligence in 2005, I thought so highly of Phil that I personally pressured him to leave the CIA and his comfort zone there to take on a challenging new task as deputy head of the FBI's fledgling National Security Branch. Phil's task there was to dramatically expand the office and move the FBI's forensics-based and law enforcement-focused analysis toward a true intelligence function -- predictive, disruptive and working the ""spaces between cases."" This was no mean task in an organization whose dominant culture was law enforcement, whose historical legacy was catching criminals and whose core professionals wore badges and carried guns.

But Phil thrived. He earned the respect of the broader FBI and tirelessly moved his workforce toward the mainstream of the intelligence community. Along the way he also became knowledgeable of and accepted by American law enforcement officers at all levels of government -- attributes that Charlie Allen did not have when he moved to the Department of Homeland Security and attributes that would have enabled Phil to tighten the linkage between local needs and national capacities. A national intelligence professional with credentials among federal and local law enforcement officers, Phil was made for the DHS job.

It will not be. Rather than go through the gantlet that we call the confirmation process, Phil decided to skip what he feared would be a ""circus."" The blogosphere had already begun to light up with commentary about his unsuitability for the post. His sin? Phil had been the deputy director of CIA's Counter-Terrorism Center and its chief analyst at the height of the agency's counterattack against al-Qaeda -- those first years after Sept. 11, 2001, when the agency felt it had to use all the tools at its disposal to learn more about and eventually disrupt follow-on al-Qaeda attacks. Phil's personal involvement in the most controversial tactics was no more than ""modest engagement,"" but he was conscientiously tasking all possible sources of information and faithfully connecting the dots as everyone expected him to do.

As he made the rounds of Hill staffers and was told that this aspect of his past, rather than his credentials for the proposed post, would probably become the focus of his hearings, he calmly (and wisely) said no. He would not become the ""meat in the sandwich,"" being badgered to answer what was his definition of torture, or whether he agreed with President Obama's description that this had been a dark period in our history, or with the former vice president's assertion that hundreds of lives had been saved, or with the speaker of the House's judgment that they ""mislead us all the time"" or with my public statements that the CIA interrogation program produced valuable intelligence. Beyond what personal psychic costs such an inquiry would impose, Phil would simply not feed the partisan beast and create yet more distractions for the community he loved and served. And so the republic will do without the officer clearly most qualified to fill the head intelligence position at DHS.

Phil's fate is symptomatic of a larger and even more troubling reality. A whole swath of intelligence professionals -- the best we had, the ones we threw at the al-Qaeda challenge when the nation was in extremis -- are suffering for their sacrifice, being held up to recrimination for many decisions that were never wholly theirs and about which there was little protest when we all believed we were in danger.

During our Civil War, in the fog of battle, the best officers would lead their men to the ""sound of the guns."" It was a simple way to deduce where you were needed most. People like Phil Mudd went dutifully to the ""sound of the guns"" after Sept. 11, and elements of the republic they selflessly served are now prepared to punish them for it. And it seems that few are willing to defend them. The White House issued a short, pro forma statement of regret at Phil's decision, and the Director of National Intelligence, the nation's senior intelligence officer, offered no public comment. Phil's veteran colleagues in the counterterrorism fight are now drawing their own conclusions about their work and their futures. Even more important, those officers coming after Phil and his generation, the products of that massive post-Sept. 11 hiring surge, are surely looking hard and taking notes.

Phil was a visible casualty of today's atmosphere. There are other losses less visible. Pray that the safety of the republic is ultimately not among them.",10,DomesticPolicy,,,,,,,82,111,2009,0.804522949,0.707219697,27.3228794,42.1971093
"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2009-07-27,0,0,1,NYT,Air Force,,,M,Warrantless Criticism,The program [President's Surveillance Program] was crucial in addressing one of the most stinging criticisms of the 9/11 commission - the need to reduce the gap between foreign intelligence and domestic security. ,"THE recent report of inspectors general on the President’s Surveillance Program operated by the National Security Agency has led some to make hasty and deeply flawed judgments about the value and legality of what was a critical part of protecting America from further attack after Sept. 11.

The program was crucial in addressing one of the most stinging criticisms of the 9/11 commission — the need to reduce the gap between foreign intelligence and domestic security. This was an especially difficult task, which helps explain both the program’s importance and its sensitivity. The program was lawful, effective and necessary.

The reflexive judgments to the contrary seem hasty at best. Although the inspectors general report notes that the compartmented nature of the program hurt its utility (it should be noted that restricting access to especially sensitive data is hardly a unique phenomenon in an intelligence community that forever has to balance using information and protecting it), it also notes that users of the information rated the program “of value,” “useful” and a “key resource,” albeit one that was most often used in combination with other intelligence sources.

Intelligence professionals call that “connecting the dots,” something for which we were roundly criticized after Sept. 11 as not sufficiently doing. The report also suggested that there were counterterrorism successes associated with the program but that these could not be discussed in an unclassified venue. Although little commented on, the report also mentions that “even those read into the program would have been unaware of the full extent” of reporting.

Let’s be clear: when the National Security Agency reported intercepted communications from this program, the reports were often disseminated in the normal intelligence production stream. An analyst would have no way of knowing the source of the information.

Some critics claim that Congress was not aware of the full extent of the program, but the ultimate judgment on the effectiveness of much of the program may actually have been the actions of Congress. In the 2008 amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress judged it appropriate not only to provide additional legal underpinnings for much of what the agency had been doing but also to recognize the value of its activities by providing additional critically needed capabilities. In my briefings to Congressional overseers from 2001 to 2005, I continually made the point that we simply could not achieve the program’s operational effect under FISA procedures as they then existed and it is clear that Congress ultimately agreed.

There has been much controversy about the lawfulness of the program. Here I must point out that agency lawyers — career attorneys with deep expertise in the law, privacy and intelligence — assisted their professional Justice Department counterparts in their review of the program but remained comfortable throughout with the lawfulness of all aspects of the surveillance effort.

IN any event, the aspect of the program that was so contentious in March 2004, when some Justice Department officials objected, resumed in only slightly modified form within six months under a new legal regime that all the players in March’s crisis supported. And it should be pointed out that the elements of the program made public in news reports in December 2005 had been consistently deemed lawful by the Justice Department.

Some have been tempted to read ominous undertones into the report’s careful prose: a passing reference without further definition to the program’s “effect on privacy interests of U.S. persons,” the parting words that information collected under the surveillance program and FISA ""should be carefully monitored,” and a reminder that there were other highly classified parts of the president’s program out there still publicly unacknowledged. Such phrases have already led to incorrect assumptions that the report concluded that the wiretaps violated the privacy of millions of American citizens.

Let me stress that Congressional overseers were told of all activities conducted by the agency under this authorization. We made clear that this program was not a minor effort but neither was it the “Big Brother” project that some have alleged. In fact, at every briefing we reported daily and cumulative activities for the program.

There is also one very large finding in the report that hasn’t received the attention it deserves: “No evidence of intentional misuse” of the program was discovered.

That is, the agency work force heeded, to the very best of its ability, the direction I gave them when the program was begun: do what the president has authorized us to do and not one photon or one electron more.

This debate on law and policy will no doubt continue, but learning will only begin when we turn down the volume, moderate our language and recognize that there is more information that will appropriately become available in time to allow both us and history to inform our judgments.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,82,111,2009,0.804522949,0.707219697,27.3228794,42.1971093

But should diplomacy and economic pressure fail, a U.S. military strike against Iran is a technically feasible and credible option.","In a policy address at the Council on Foreign Relations last month, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said of Iran, ""We cannot be afraid or unwilling to engage."" But the Iranian government has yet to accept President Obama's outstretched hand. Even if Tehran suddenly acceded to talks, U.S. policy makers must prepare for the eventuality that diplomacy fails. While there has been much discussion of economic sanctions, we cannot neglect the military's role in a Plan B.

There has been a lack of serious public discussion of the military tools available to us. Any mention of them is either met with accusations of warmongering or hushed with concerns over sharing sensitive information. It is important to discuss, within legal limits, such a serious issue as openly as possible. Discussion strengthens our democracy and dispels misinformation.

The military can play an important role in solving this complex problem without firing a single shot. Publicly signaling serious preparation for a military strike might obviate the need for one if deployments force Tehran to recognize the costs of its nuclear defiance. Mr. Obama might consider, for example, the deployment of additional carrier battle groups and minesweepers to the waters off Iran, and the conduct of military exercises with allies.

If such pressure fails to impress Iranian leadership, the U.S. Navy could move to blockade Iranian ports. A blockade -- which is an act of war -- would effectively cut off Iran's gasoline imports, which constitute about one-third of its consumption. Especially in the aftermath of post-election protests, the Iranian leadership must worry about the economic dislocations and political impact of such action.

Should these measures not compel Tehran to reverse course on its nuclear program, and only after all other diplomatic avenues and economic pressures have been exhausted, the U.S. military is capable of launching a devastating attack on Iranian nuclear and military facilities.

Many policy makers and journalists dismiss the military option on the basis of a false sense of futility. They assume that the U.S. military is already overstretched, that we lack adequate intelligence about the location of covert nuclear sites, and that known sites are too heavily fortified.

Such assumptions are false.

An attack on Iranian nuclear facilities would mostly involve air assets, primarily Air Force and Navy, that are not strained by operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Moreover, the presence of U.S. forces in countries that border Iran offers distinct advantages. Special Forces and intelligence personnel already in the region can easily move to protect key assets or perform clandestine operations. It would be prudent to emplace additional missile-defense capabilities in the region, upgrade both regional facilities and allied militaries, and expand strategic partnerships with countries such as Azerbaijan and Georgia to pressure Iran from all directions.

Conflict may reveal previously undetected Iranian facilities as Iranian forces move to protect them. Moreover, nuclear sites buried underground may survive sustained bombing, but their entrances and exits will not.

Of course, there are huge risks to military action: U.S. and allied casualties; rallying Iranians around an unstable and oppressive regime; Iranian reprisals be they direct or by proxy against us and our allies; and Iranian-instigated unrest in the Persian Gulf states, first and foremost in Iraq.

Furthermore, while a successful bombing campaign would set back Iranian nuclear development, Iran would undoubtedly retain its nuclear knowhow. An attack would also necessitate years of continued vigilance, both to retain the ability to strike previously undiscovered sites and to ensure that Iran does not revive its nuclear program.

But the risks of military action must be weighed against those of doing nothing. If the Iranian regime continues to advance its nuclear program despite the best efforts of Mr. Obama and other world leaders, we risk Iranian domination of the oil-rich Persian Gulf, threats to U.S.-allied Arab regimes, the emboldening of radicals in the region, the creation of an existential threat to Israel, the destabilization of Iraq, the shutdown of the Israel-Palestinian peace process, and a regional nuclear-arms race.

A peaceful resolution of the threat posed by Iran's nuclear ambitions would certainly be the best possible outcome.

-- Saddam Hussein, before Desert Storm

High-end conventional war is characterized by the clash of industrial forces. It's armored, mechanized and increasingly air-power centric. Few are equipped by training or temperament to understand the phenomenon, especially as it concerns air warfare, a relatively recent aspect of the human experience. (In this regard, Saddam Hussein had plenty of company.) But the bottom line is that in high-end conventional war, neither our Army nor Navy can be defeated unless someone first defeats our Air Force.

For high-end conventional war we've built an Air Force that, for now, is virtually unbeatable. Anyone looking at our air-power capabilities knows there is little hope they can concentrate conventional forces for decisive engagement of our Army or Navy. We will track them and pick them to pieces. When Saddam Hussein tried us on for size in the early-1990s, the ground war was a four-day walkover that followed the initial 39 days of aerial combat.

So today, no one in his right mind wants to fight us in a conventional war. Many are saying this another way: that we have no ""peer competitor,"" that there is no threat of high-end conventional war. I wouldn't bet the ranch on that, but, if it is so, it is a desirable condition and one that didn't happen by accident.

We have forced anyone with a bone to pick with us to find an alternative to high-end, conventional war. We've had to invent a vocabulary for this low end: ""asymmetrical"" conflict, it being another poorly understood activity. But it seems clear that in this sort of war our existence is not threatened, that we can regulate the resource input. It can be expensive in men and material, but we cannot be defeated militarily.

When the enemy succeeds, it is because we do not defeat him and then weary of the fight. This is not a good outcome, but it is better -- and much cheaper for us in lives and treasure -- than losing a high-end, conventional conflict.

The future air combat capabilities we should build are based on the F-22, a stealthy, fast, maneuverable fighter that is unmatched by any known or projected combat aircraft. But the F-22's production run may soon come to an end at just 187 planes, well short of establishing the fleet size we need. After all, it's expensive, and getting more so as the number contemplated has been repeatedly reduced. In an argument they seem to think makes sense, critics say the aircraft has no worthy opponent -- as if we want to create forces that do have peer competitors.

It's been more than half a century since any American soldier or Marine has been killed, or even wounded, by hostile aircraft, a period roughly coincident with the existence of the Air Force as a separate service. Even during the Korean War -- the Air Force's first engagement wearing new, blue uniforms -- enemy air attack was primitive and rare. The main air battle was fought along the Yalu River, just as in Vietnam it was fought over Hanoi, and in Desert Storm, over Baghdad. Our guys on the ground had hard work to do, but when they looked up, they saw only friendly skies.

"Eisenhower, John",1974,1,2009-10-18,0,0,1,NYT,Army,,,M,How Generals Should Talk to Presidents,"Ideally, something could be worked out to make it easier for officers to express their views privately to the president without being subject to testifying before Congress. Perhaps the Joint Chiefs of Staff could be divorced from their roles as the heads of services. The service heads, charged with structure, would then be free to testify; the chiefs, advising the president on strategy, would be granted executive privilege. Unfortunately, such privilege will probably never be granted, and the military, among their other burdens, will have to cope with this balancing act.","IN a recent speech in London, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top United States commander in Afghanistan, was blunt. Calling the military situation there ""deteriorating,"" he warned that the United States was going to have to ""do things dramatically and even uncomfortably differently."" General McChrystal had already submitted a report, somehow leaked, requesting an additional 40,000 American troops. He acknowledged in his speech that in so speaking out while the issue was still under debate in the White House, he might have difficulties with his superiors.

Comparisons have been made between this situation and the unfortunate instance in 2003 when the Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, was punished for advising Congress of the enormous effort it would take to defeat and pacify Iraq in any meaningful way. General Shinseki was not removed outright, but he was treated shabbily by the Bush administration in more subtle ways until his retirement later that year. But the two cases were different. General Shinseki was testifying under oath before Congress; General McChrystal was speaking voluntarily, on his own.

As a former Army officer, I tend to be sympathetic to the generals who are placed in impossible situations, created partly by the framers of the Constitution in 1787. They designated the president as the commander in chief, but at the same time they gave Congress the power to raise and support armies and navies.

This division of authority between two branches of government puts the head of a military service in an untenable position. Officers owe their loyalty to the president and have an obligation to resign if they are unable to carry out the commander in chief's policies. At the same time, they must sometimes testify under oath to the Congress. Trapped in this way, most officers elect wisely to keep their public opinions vague.

In the past, speaking out has cost careers, or at least shortened them. The most noted instance was President Harry Truman's firing of Gen. Douglas MacArthur in the spring of 1951 -- during the Korean War, the general was openly advocating taking measures against Communist China that the president and his advisers deemed dangerous to world peace.

My father, Dwight D. Eisenhower, declined to reappoint an Army chief of staff and a chief of naval operations because they had resisted his ""New Look"" policy, which restructured the Defense Department to better address the threat of nuclear war. But my father also believed that the Air Force -- a beneficiary of the New Look -- was demanding too much spending. That's why he cautioned against the ""unwarranted influence"" of the military-industrial complex, a warning expressed in avuncular tones but with real anger behind it. Actually, in the case of the New Look, both the administration and the military services had legitimate viewpoints. The flaw is in the system.

Ideally, something could be worked out to make it easier for officers to express their views privately to the president without being subject to testifying before Congress. Perhaps the Joint Chiefs of Staff could be divorced from their roles as the heads of services. The service heads, charged with structure, would then be free to testify; the chiefs, advising the president on strategy, would be granted executive privilege. Unfortunately, such privilege will probably never be granted, and the military, among their other burdens, will have to cope with this balancing act.

General McChrystal has been gently but adequately chastised, but his great experience and ability preserved. As a strategy in Afghanistan is formulated, the president will have plenty more second-guessers on his hands. The military should not be among them -- at least in public.",7,CivMilBalance,,,,,,,82,111,2009,0.804522949,0.707219697,27.3228794,42.1971093
"Sorley, Lewis",,1,2009-10-18,0,0,1,NYT,Army,,,M,The Vietnam War We Ignore,"[Comparisons between Vietnam and Afghanistan] can be useful, but only if the characteristics of earlier wars are accurate and lessons are appropriately applied. ","AS President Obama and his advisers contemplate a new course for Afghanistan, many commentators are suggesting analogies with earlier conflicts, particularly the war in Vietnam. Such comparisons can be useful, but only if the characterizations of earlier wars are accurate and lessons are appropriately applied.

Vietnam is particularly tricky. While avoiding the missteps made there is of course a priority, few seem aware of the many successful changes in strategy undertaken in the later years of the conflict. The credit for those accomplishments goes in large part to three men: Ellsworth Bunker, who became the American ambassador to South Vietnam in 1967; William Colby, the C.I.A. officer in charge of rural “pacification” efforts; and Gen. Creighton Abrams, who became the top American commander there in 1968.

A closer look at key aspects of how these men rethought their war may prove instructive to those considering our options in Afghanistan today. Among their principles were these:

•

Fight one war: Abrams, Bunker and Colby agreed that the war would be fought — and won or lost — in the villages. They decided to put equal priority on all key aspects of the war — thus the improvement of South Vietnam’s armed forces and the elimination of covert Vietcong bases and refuges in rural areas were given the same emphasis as large combat operations.

In Afghanistan, it is vital that American and NATO troops get out of their protected bases to work alongside Afghan forces and build trust with civilians. In some ways this may be trickier than in Vietnam, as our troops will have to navigate the tribal and ethnic rivalries that have long divided Afghan society.

•

Rethink combat operations: The early strategy in Vietnam was to use large units in “search and destroy” sweeps — often on ground of the enemy’s choosing in the deep jungle. Abrams decided instead to try “clear and hold” operations, in which small patrols were sent to villages to protect the populace. These troops were followed by South Vietnamese security forces — which Abrams made sure would get better training and equipment and were integrated into the regular army — to provide the “hold.”

In Afghanistan, combat does little good unless allied or Afghan forces remain behind to keep the Taliban from simply moving back in.

•

Restrain the use of force: Early on, Abrams said, “My problem is colored blue.” By that he meant that friendly forces (usually portrayed in blue on battle maps, as contrasted to the enemy shown in red) were causing undue “collateral damage” to the South Vietnamese people and their property. He reined in the use of heavy firepower like artillery and tactical airstrikes.

Allied forces in Afghanistan may have to accept increased risks to themselves as the price of protecting the population. There have been some grumblings that they are hampered by the rules of engagement, and perhaps in platoon-level operations that it true. But Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top American commander in Afghanistan, is right that Western forces have to cut down on civilian deaths caused by air power and reckless use of force.

•

Create an effective central government: As Nguyen Van Thieu, who became South Vietnam’s president in 1967, gained experience and influence, senior Americans came to regard him as the “No. 1 pacification officer.” He traveled extensively, promoting and evaluating local programs. And by 1972 his “Land to the Tiller” initiative had achieved genuine land reform, distributing two and a half million acres of land to nearly 400,000 farmers.

President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan has no signature triumph like Land to the Tiller, nor has he made many efforts to reach out to average Afghans. Perhaps Washington should make some of its support to his government contingent on anticorruption efforts and delivering real services to his people.

•

Support local governments: In Vietnam, rural hamlets were able to elect their own officials, who were sent to training sessions in the port city of Vung Tau. President Thieu spoke to every class, emphasizing that they had to be “little presidents” and make good use of the resources that the central government would provide for economic growth, health care and schools.

Given the diversified population of Afghanistan there has been too much emphasis on central government — if the Karzai government lags in giving money and supplies to local and tribal leaders, the United States should consider doling out more aid directly to them.

•

Gather intelligence: “The intelligence is the most important part of this whole damn thing,” Abrams told a visiting officer. “And if that’s good, we can handle anything.” The best way to root out the enemy’s secret bases in Vietnam was to get good information from villagers and “ralliers,” former Vietcong rebels who had switched sides.

In Afghanistan, a continuing security presence in contested areas will be key to getting Afghans and former insurgents to aid the war effort. As long as they fear Taliban reprisal, locals will stay silent.

•

Build the economy: Vietnam depended on rice, and widespread fighting and enemy gains in early years took many acres of land out of cultivation. Pacification efforts put some of that land back into production and re-opened local markets, while the introduction of genetically engineered “miracle rice” greatly increased yields. In Afghanistan, finding viable alternative crops for farmers now growing opium poppies would seem to be a first order of business.

•

Improve security: Protection of the people (not body counts, as in the earlier period) became the measure of progress in Vietnam. The appropriate metrics to watch in Afghanistan are probably economic growth, the percentage of children attending school and health data, along with freedom of movement within and between population centers.

•

Control the borders: In South Vietnam, allied forces were never able to seal off borders with Cambodia, Laos or North Vietnam. The self-imposed prohibitions against going outside South Vietnam with ground forces allowed the enemy to use border areas for training, supply routes and sanctuary.

Similarly, the Taliban uses the Pakistan border as its own barrier, and American drone attacks can do only so much. Either Washington must find a way to get the Pakistanis to step up the fight against the terrorists, or consider operations across the border.

•

Maintain political support at home: All that was accomplished on the battlefield in the latter years of Vietnam was lost when Congress, having tired of the whole endeavor, drastically cut support for South Vietnam. Neither Lyndon Johnson nor Richard Nixon was able to rally public and press support for the war.

President Obama has said that Afghanistan is a war of necessity. If so, he must put his political capital behind it. As he and his advisers plan the new course for the war, he must also come up with a new approach for selling it to Congress and the American people.",5,Warfighting,,,,,,,82,111,2009,0.804522949,0.707219697,27.3228794,42.1971093

I've Seen these Tactics Before.,"Today, Hezbollah directly threatens Israel, destabilizes Lebanon, and undercuts the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Something similar is underway in Venezuela. Remember Hezbollah used the Beirut truck-bomb model for the attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires on March 17, 1992 and the July 18, 1994 attack on the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association that killed 85 and wounded 200.","The nagging question of the nuclear age has been what if a madman gets hold of an atomic bomb? That question is about to be answered as Iran's defiance puts it on a collision course with the West.

On Nov. 4, 2009, Israeli commandos intercepted an Antiguan-flagged ship 100 miles off the Israeli coast. It was carrying hundreds of tons of weapons from Iran and bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. Since the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah war, Iran has rearmed Hezbollah with 40,000 rockets and missiles that will likely rain on Israeli cities -- and even European cities and U.S. military bases in the Middle East -- if Iran is attacked. Our 200,000 troops in 33 bases are vulnerable. Shortly before this weapons seizure, Hamas test-fired a missile capable of striking Israel's largest city, Tel Aviv.

Iran is capable of disrupting Persian Gulf shipping lanes, which could cause the price of oil to surge above $300 a barrel. Iran could also create mayhem in oil markets by attacking Saudi oil refineries. Moreover, Iran possesses Soviet made SS-N-22 ""Sunburn"" supersonic antiship missiles that it could use to contest a naval blockade.

Iran could unleash suicide bombers in Iraq and Afghanistan or, more ominously, activate Hezbollah sleeper cells in the U.S. to carry out coordinated attacks nationwide. FBI, CIA and other U.S. officials have acknowledged in congressional testimony that Hezbollah has a working partnership with Mexican drug cartels and has been using cartel smuggling routes to get personnel and contraband into the U.S.

While Iranian centrifuges continue to produce low-enriched uranium, the mullahs and their henchmen have been carrying out a campaign of deception. In October 2009, Iran rejected a plan to ship its low-enriched uranium out of country, primarily to Russia and France, to be highly enriched and then sent back to Iran for ""peaceful medical purposes.""

On Nov. 28, 2009, reacting to increased pressure from the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran warned it may pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This would seriously undermine international attempts to stop Iran's nuclear weapons program. Two days later, Iran announced plans to build 10 new nuclear plants within six years.

In another sphere, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez are openly cooperating to ""oppose world hegemony,"" as Mr. Ahmadinejan has said, while weekly flights between Iran and Venezuela are not monitored for personnel and cargo. Meanwhile, Russia is building an arms plant in Venezuela to produce AK-103 automatic rifles and finalizing contracts to send 53 military helicopters to the country.

I have seen this play before. In 1983, I was the Marine commander of the U.S. Multinational Peacekeeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) Lebanon contingent trained and equipped Hezbollah to execute attacks that killed 241 of my men and 58 French Peacekeepers on Oct. 23, 1983.

Today, Hezbollah directly threatens Israel, destabilizes Lebanon, and undercuts the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Something similar is underway in Venezuela. Remember Hezbollah used the Beirut truck-bomb model for the attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires on March 17, 1992 and the July 18, 1994 attack on the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association that killed 85 and wounded 200.

The man directly responsible for those bombings was the commander of the IRGC's Quds Force, Gen. Ahmad Vahidi. He is listed on Interpol's most wanted list and was a key operative in the 1983 attacks on peacekeepers in Lebanon. In August 2009, he was named Iran's minister of defense. He succeeded Gen. Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, who was the commander of the IRGC Lebanon contingent and the chief organizer of the 1983 Beirut bombings. Both have Beirut peacekeepers' blood on their hands and are the same key leaders who today are orchestrating Iranian deception and defiance as they march lock-step toward their ultimate goal -- nuclear weapons.

"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2010-01-31,0,0,1,WaPO,Air Force,,,M,Justice and Terror: The Mishandling of Enemy Combatants,"There's a final oddity. In August, the government unveiled the HIG for questioning al-Qaeda and announced that the FBI would begin questioning CIA officers about the alleged abuses in the 2004 inspector general's report. They are apparently still getting organized for the al-Qaeda interrogations. But the interrogations of CIA personnel are well underway.","In the war on terrorism, this country faces an enemy whose theory of warfare ends the hard-won distinction in modern thought between combatant and noncombatant. In doing that for which we have created government -- ensuring life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- how can we be adequately aggressive to ensure the first value, without unduly threatening the other two? This is hard. And people don't have to be lazy or stupid to get it wrong.

We got it wrong in Detroit on Christmas Day. We allowed an enemy combatant the protections of our Constitution before we had adequately interrogated him. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is not ""an isolated extremist."" He is the tip of the spear of a complex al-Qaeda plot to kill Americans in our homeland.

In the 50 minutes the FBI had to question him, agents reportedly got actionable intelligence. Good. But were there any experts on al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in the room (other than Abdulmutallab)? Was there anyone intimately familiar with any National Security Agency raw traffic to, from or about the captured terrorist? Did they have a list or photos of suspected recruits?

When questioning its detainees, the CIA routinely turns the information provided over to its experts for verification and recommendations for follow-up. The responses of these experts -- ""Press him more on this, he knows the details"" or ""First time we've heard that"" -- helps set up more detailed questioning.

None of that happened in Detroit. In fact, we ensured that it wouldn't. After the first session, the FBI Mirandized Abdulmutallab and -- to preserve a potential prosecution -- sent in a ""clean team"" of agents who could have no knowledge of what Abdulmutallab had provided before he was given his constitutional warnings. As has been widely reported, Abdulmutallab then exercised his right to remain silent.

In retrospect, the inadvisability of this approach seems self-evident. Perhaps it didn't appear that way on Dec. 25 because we have, over the past year, become acclimated to certain patterns of thought.

Two days after his inauguration, President Obama issued an executive order that limited all interrogations by the U.S. government to the techniques authorized in the Army Field Manual. The CIA had not seen the final draft of the order, let alone been allowed to comment, before it was issued. I thought that odd since the order was less a legal document -- there was no claim that the manual exhausted the universe of lawful techniques -- than a policy one: These particular lawful techniques would be all that the country would need, at least for now.

A similar drama unfolded in April over the release of Justice Department memos that had authorized the CIA interrogation program. CIA Director Leon Panetta and several of his predecessors opposed public release of the memos in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit on the only legitimate grounds for such a stand: that the documents were legitimately still classified and their release would gravely harm national security. On this policy -- not legal -- question, the president sided with his attorney general rather than his CIA chief.

In August, seemingly again in contradiction to the president's policy of not looking backward and over the objections of the CIA, Justice pushed to release the CIA inspector general's report on the interrogation program. Then Justice decided to reopen investigations of CIA officers that had been concluded by career prosecutors years ago, even though Panetta and seven of his predecessors said that doing so would be unfair, unwarranted and harmful to the agency's current mission.

In November, Justice announced that it intended to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and several others in civilian courts for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The White House made clear that this was a Justice Department decision, which is odd because the decision was not legally compelled (other detainees are to be tried by military commissions) and the reasons given for making it (military trials could serve as a recruitment tool for al-Qaeda, harm relations with allies, etc.) were not legal but political.

Even tough government organizations, such as those in the intelligence community, figure out pretty quickly what their political masters think is not acceptable behavior. The executive order that confined interrogations to the Army Field Manual also launched a task force to investigate whether those techniques were sufficient for national needs. Few observers believed that the group would recommend changes, and to date, no techniques have been added to the manual.

Intelligence officers need to know that someone has their back. After the Justice memos were released in April, CIA officers began to ask whether the people doing things that were currently authorized would be dragged through this kind of public knothole in five years. No one could guarantee that they would not.

Some may celebrate that the current Justice Department's perspective on the war on terrorism has become markedly more dominant in the past year. We should probably understand the implications of that before we break out the champagne. That apparently no one recommended on Christmas Day that Abdulmutallab be handled, at least for a time, as an enemy combatant should be concerning. That our director of national intelligence, Denny Blair, bravely said as much during congressional testimony this month is cause for hope.

Actually, Blair suggested that the High Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG), announced by the administration in August, should have been called in. A government spokesman later pointed out that the group does not yet exist.

There's a final oddity. In August, the government unveiled the HIG for questioning al-Qaeda and announced that the FBI would begin questioning CIA officers about the alleged abuses in the 2004 inspector general's report. They are apparently still getting organized for the al-Qaeda interrogations. But the interrogations of CIA personnel are well underway.

"Rubenstein, Leonard and Xenakis, Stephen",1998,1,2010-03-01,0,0,1,NYT,Army,,,M,Doctors Without Morals,"Nevertheless, no agency, not the Pentagon, not the CIA…has initiated any action to investigate, much less discipline, these individuals…It is not too late to begin investigations. They should start now. ","AFTER five years of investigation, the Justice Department has released its findings regarding the government
lawyers who authorized waterboarding and other forms of torture during the interrogation of suspected terrorists at
Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. The report's conclusion, that the lawyers exercised poor judgment but were not
guilty of professional misconduct, is questionable at best. Still, the review reflects a commitment to a transparent
investigation of professional behavior.
In contrast, the government doctors and psychologists who participated in and authorized the torture of detainees
have escaped discipline, accountability or even internal investigation.
It is hardly news that medical staff at the C.I.A. and the Pentagon played a critical role in developing and carrying
out torture procedures. Psychologists and at least one doctor designed or recommended coercive interrogation
methods including sleep deprivation, stress positions, isolation and waterboarding. The military's Behavioral
Science Consultation Teams evaluated detainees, consulted their medical records to ascertain vulnerabilities and
advised interrogators when to push harder for intelligence information.
Psychologists designed a program for new arrivals at Guantanamo that kept them in isolation to ''enhance and
exploit'' their ''disorientation and disorganization.'' Medical officials monitored interrogations and ordered medical
interventions so they could continue even when the detainee was in obvious distress. In one case, an interrogation
log obtained by Time magazine shows, a medical corpsman ordered intravenous fluids to be administered to a
dehydrated detainee even as loud music was played to deprive him of sleep.
When the C.I.A.'s inspector general challenged these ''enhanced interrogation'' methods, the agency's Office of
Medical Services was brought in to determine, in consultation with the Justice Department, whether the techniques
inflicted severe mental pain or suffering, the legal definition of torture. Once again, doctors played a critical role,
providing professional opinions that no severe pain or suffering was being inflicted.
According to Justice Department memos released last year, the medical service opined that sleep deprivation up
to 180 hours didn't qualify as torture. It determined that confinement in a dark, small space for 18 hours a day was
acceptable. It said detainees could be exposed to cold air or hosed down with cold water for up to two-thirds of the
time it takes for hypothermia to set in. And it advised that placing a detainee in handcuffs attached by a chain to a
ceiling, then forcing him to stand with his feet shackled to a bolt in the floor, ''does not result in significant pain for
the subject.''
The service did allow that waterboarding could be dangerous, and that the experience of feeling unable to breathe
is extremely frightening. But it noted that the C.I.A. had limited its use to 12 applications over two sessions within 24
Page 2 of 3
Doctors Without Morals
hours, and to five days in any 30-day period. As a result, the lawyers noted the office's ''professional judgment that
the use of the waterboard on a healthy individual subject to these limitations would be 'medically acceptable.'''
The medical basis for these opinions was nonexistent. The Office of Medical Services cited no studies of
individuals who had been subjected to these techniques. Its sources included a wilderness medical manual, the
National Institute of Mental Health Web site and guidelines from the World Health Organization.
The only medical source cited by the service was a book by Dr. James Horne, a sleep expert at Loughborough
University in Britain; when Dr. Horne learned that his book had been used as a reference, he said the C.I.A. had
distorted his findings and misrepresented his research, and that its conclusions on sleep deprivation were
nonsense.
Dr. Horne had used healthy volunteers who were subject to no other stresses and could withdraw at any time,
while C.I.A. and Pentagon interrogators used a broad array of stresses in combination on the detainees. Sleep
deprivation, he said, mixed with pain-inducing positioning, intimidation and a host of other stresses, would probably
exhaust the body's defense mechanisms, cause physical collapse and worsen existing illness. And that doesn't
begin to acknowledge the dire psychological consequences.
The shabbiness of the medical judgments, though, pales in comparison to the ethical breaches by the doctors and
psychologists involved. Health professionals have a responsibility extending well beyond nonparticipation in torture;
the historic maxim is, after all, ''First do no harm.'' These health professionals did the polar opposite.
Nevertheless, no agency -- not the Pentagon, the C.I.A., state licensing boards or professional medical societies --
has initiated any action to investigate, much less discipline, these individuals. They have ignored the gross and
appalling violations by medical personnel. This is an unconscionable disservice to the thousands of ethical",7,ServiceCulture,,,,,,,76,111,2009,0.804522949,0.707219697,27.3228794,42.1971093

Sometimes they win or lose because of material factors, because one side has the greater numbers or better equipment. But armies are sure to lose if they pay no attention to the ideas that succeed in battle. Unit cohesion is one such idea. We know, or ought to, that warriors are inspired by male bonding, by comradeship, by the knowledge that they survive only through relying on each other. To undermine cohesion is to endanger everyone.","Last week, China announced it was cancelling a planned visit to the United States by Gen. Chen Bingde, the chief of the general staff of China's army. At the same time, a visit to China by the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Adm. Robert Willard, was scrapped.

These are only the latest casualties in the broad suspension of all military-to-military exchanges with the U.S. by China -- a step Beijing is taking in retaliation for Washington's decision to sell $6.4 billion in military equipment to Taiwan.

Some may ask: What's the big deal? Suspending military contact seems like a low-stakes way to express displeasure, especially compared to the alternatives.

In fact the costs can be enormous. Military-to-military contacts help us build relationships of trust in peacetime that we rely on when tensions rise. Such relationships can potentially mean the difference between war and peace when a crisis arrives.

Unfortunately, Washington is in no position to lecture Beijing on its current policy. We have been just as quick to use our military-to-military ties as a weapon to punish other nations. But every time we do so, it hurts us more than it hurts the intended recipient.

Consider Pakistan. In 1985, Congress passed the Pressler Amendment, which required that all military-to-military ties with Pakistan be terminated if the president could not certify that Pakistan did not have a nuclear program. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush could no longer make that certification. So he was forced to cut off military ties with Islamabad: no more high-level meetings of senior officers; no more joint exercises; no more Pakistani junior officers training at American military schools and academies.

This did nothing to stop Pakistan from eventually declaring itself a nuclear power. And it cost us dearly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when the U.S. needed rapid and unprecedented cooperation with Pakistan's military in the fight against al Qaeda but had lost a generation of contacts with Pakistani officers.

Such contacts are invaluable to the security of our country. When we hold exercises with foreign militaries, we build the confidence that can only be gained through joint operations in the field. When the U.S. brings junior officers from foreign militaries to study here, they build friendships with American officers that can last a lifetime.

I experienced this time and time again during my military career. When I was serving as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the U.S. received a diplomatic note from a foreign government declaring it had intelligence that a squadron of jet fighters from another country was preparing to attack it.

It just so happened that two of the highest ranking military leaders in both countries had been classmates of mine at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. I called the first classmate and told him about the note we had received. He assured me that all his fighters were accounted for and no such attack was planned. Then I called the second classmate, waking him up at 4:30 a.m. to pass on those assurances. He accepted them, based on my word.

A potential crisis was averted thanks to personal relationships that had been forged 20 years earlier through the U.S. military exchange program.

Today, there is an officer somewhere in China who was planning to come to the U.S., quite possibly to study at Fort Leavenworth. There is a young American officer who would have sat next to him in class and gotten to know him in informal settings.

It's likely that they would have stayed in contact as both rose through the ranks of their respective militaries. And in a moment of tension between our countries somewhere down the line, one might have picked up the phone and called the other to find out what the other country intended.

Now that phone call may never be made. That could prove to be a tragedy one day -- for China, for the U.S., and for the world.",10,SocialPolicy,,,,,,,76,111,2009,0.804522949,0.707219697,27.3228794,42.1971093

Military-to-military contacts help us build relationships of trust in peacetime that we rely on when tensions rise. Such relationships can potentially mean the difference between war and peace when a crisis arrives.,"THE chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, favors repeal of ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the nickname
for the policy regulating military service by homosexuals. ''I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have
in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow
citizens,'' he told the Senate last month.
I was one of the service chiefs when the ''don't ask, don't tell'' compromise was reached in 1993. Until then, every
person coming into the military was asked questions directed at establishing sexual orientation, and admitted
homosexuals were automatically rejected. Thus the ''don't ask'' part of the rule actually means gays no longer
have to lie.
In return, the services insisted that homosexuals serving in uniform stay closeted. No doubt this is what bothers
Admiral Mullen, as it obliges homosexuals to ''live a lie,'' if not actually tell one. But this part of the formula was not
about individuals. It aimed to protect the institutional integrity of the services, which have no higher responsibility
than to organize, train and equip formations that are effective on the battlefield. Seventeen years ago, the chiefs --
all four of us, plus the chairman and vice chairman -- concluded that allowing open homosexuality in the ranks
would probably damage the cohesiveness of our combat units.
A lot more heat than light was produced in the 1993 debate. What passed for dialogue then was often strident and
uninformed, each side denouncing motives rather than examining convictions. Even though, as Colin Powell
observed recently, the world has ''changed'' some in the intervening years, I doubt that we'll have a more
enlightened public discussion in 2010.
If one is to occur, it should start with the question, ''What are armed forces for?'' Assuming the services exist to
fight and win wars, those seeking fundamental change in the composition of combat units carry a special burden of
proof.
Perhaps young American men and women will fight better when openly gay soldiers are included in the ranks,
though I've heard no one make this claim. Instead, advocates for gays in the service have by and large avoided a
discussion of unit cohesion, relying instead on arguments falling into three categories: training costs, civil rights and
individual performance.
First, they say, many otherwise proficient servicemen and women are tossed out only because of an inability or
unwillingness to stay closeted. As the services keep track of what it costs to train somebody in a specific skill, the
Page 2 of 4
Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Change
price tag, we are told, can be calculated simply by multiplying the number of service members ejected by the cost of
training a replacement.
But this is the wrong way to reckon cost. Each service maintains a multibillion-dollar training system: bases,
classrooms, instructors and so forth. This is necessary because of the substantial turnover as service members
return to civilian life. The size and cost of the training system is influenced over time by economic factors like pay
and benefits or employment opportunities in the civilian sector. In recent years the services have been able to make
sizable cuts in training infrastructure because of better retention in an all-volunteer, more professional force.
Nonetheless, these large-scale factors swamp the question of marginal training cost. In the early 1990s, as we
thought through the implications of ''don't ask, don't tell,'' I worked out the numbers for the Air Force. During the
previous decade, we'd put about 800,000 people through basic and advanced training programs, at a cost of about
$30 billion. The money we expended on training 3,000 people who were eventually removed on account of
homosexuality was minuscule by comparison. (During the same decade, we forced out 15 times as many people for
failure to meet Air Force weight standards, with no one objecting to the cost.)
As one might guess, most homosexuality ''separations,'' as they are called in the Air Force, occurred in the first
few weeks of basic training, before the more costly technical training began. And many of these removals would
have occurred in any case, since they were the result of unacceptable conduct and not just a declaration of sexual
orientation. In any case, it would have made no material difference in Air Force training costs if we had retained all
3,000 people.
The second major argument for allowing openly gay service is that it's a matter of civil rights, akin to racial
integration. This view must rest on the notion that serving in the armed forces is a job like any other, and therefore
civilian anti-discrimination laws should apply. While it may seem hopelessly idealistic, my view is that serving in
uniform amounts to a calling, different in many ways from other jobs. (One of the ways is that your employer can
order you to risk your life.)
But let's limit ourselves to practical considerations. The services exclude, without challenge, many categories of
prospective entrants. People cannot serve in uniform if they are too old or too young, too fat or too thin, too tall or
too short, disabled, not sufficiently educated and so on. This, too, might be illegal in the civil sector. So why should
exclusion of gay people rise to the status of a civil-rights issue, when denying entry to, say, unmarried individuals
with sole custody of dependents under 18, does not?
There is also some misunderstanding about President Harry Truman's executive order of 1948, calling for equality
in the armed forces, which is often cited as a model that President Obama should follow. No doubt Truman's action
was a landmark in the civil rights struggle. However, the order was not actually sufficient inducement for the armed
forces to do the right thing.
At the time, the Air Force had prepared itself for racial integration and its leadership pushed hard to make it work.
As a consequence, the integration of blacks in the Air Force is one of the great success stories of the civil rights
movement.
The Army and Navy, however, were models of passive resistance. The Air Force had nearly completed integration
before the Army really started. Technically, Truman's order made no reference to ending segregation, speaking
only of equality of opportunity and treatment regardless of ''race, color, religion or national origin.'' And the Army, at
first, argued it was in full compliance. Its subsequent integration was largely forced on it by combat losses in allwhite
units during the first months of the Korean War. The Navy continued much of its policy of tokenism into the
1960s, with a black steward corps still waiting tables 10 years after the executive order.
Harry Truman did not simply pass his hand over the Pentagon and bring about racial justice. Only after the leaders
of each service committed their institutions did we make real progress.
Thus allowing an openly gay presence in ranks will be very difficult until we have committed leadership for it. I
certainly had trouble figuring out how to provide such leadership in 1993. While I believed all people are created

equal, I did not believe such equality extended to all ideas or all cultures. And since I didn't know how to advocate
the assimilation of this particular form of diversity, I saw no way to prevent it from undermining unit cohesion.
LAST, and most frequently heard, is the seemingly businesslike argument that what's important is an individual's
performance. Hundreds of service members are mustered out annually for failing to stay closeted, regardless of job
performance. Indeed, we seem to have here an odd exception to the American idea that people should be judged
by their actions rather than their makeup.
But it would be a serious mistake to imagine that personal performance is what matters in combat. Combat is not a
contest between individuals, like poker or tennis; it is a team event whose success depends on group cooperation
and morale. So the behavior that concerns us is not individual achievement but the social dynamics of relationships
and groups. The issue is whether and how the presence of openly declared homosexuals in the ranks affects the
solidarity of the unit.
We have already seen the fault lines form in the current debate: the individual service chiefs have expressed
reservations about Admiral Mullen's views. This lack of cohesion will likely make the Joint Chiefs less effective in
the latest round of this debate.
Armies have to care about what succeeds in war. Sometimes they win or lose because of material factors,
because one side has the greater numbers or better equipment. But armies are sure to lose if they pay no attention
to the ideas that succeed in battle. Unit cohesion is one such idea. We know, or ought to, that warriors are inspired
by male bonding, by comradeship, by the knowledge that they survive only through relying on each other. To
undermine cohesion is to endanger everyone.
I know some will see these ingredients of the military lifestyle as a sort of absurd, tough-guy game played by
overgrown boys. But to prepare warriors for a life of hardship, the military must remain a kind of adventure, apart
from the civilian world and full of strange customs. To be a fighter pilot or a paratrooper or a submariner is to join a
self-contained, resolutely idealistic society, largely unnoticed and surprisingly uncorrupted by the world at large.
I do not see how permitting open homosexuality in these communities enhances their prospects of success in
battle. Indeed, I believe repealing ''don't ask, don't tell'' will weaken the warrior culture at a time when we have a
fight on our hands.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,76,111,2009,0.804522949,0.707219697,27.3228794,42.1971093
"Sheehan, Michael",,1,2010-05-04,0,0,1,NYT,Army,,,M,The Terrorist Next Door,"As the New York case reminds us, there are people out there with the intent to kill. The job of law enforcement is to catch them before they are successful, and if that is not possible, to prevent them from becoming a real strategic threat rather than a small but deadly menace to our society. While we hope we can find lone wolves before they attack, we also need to reduce the threat they pose by identifying, infiltrating and crushing any terrorist organization before it can mount a sophisticated operation, or before it provides deadly technical support and training to the next Times Square bomber.","WHILE it's possible that this weekend's failed car-bomb incident in Times Square was part of a complicated international terrorist plot, the unsophisticated nature of the device has given rise to a much-needed discussion about the threat of ""home grown"" and ""lone wolf"" violence in the United States.

The subject leads many to throw up their hands: how, short of creating a police state, can we prevent a lone deranged person from making a crude bomb and parking it somewhere?

The truth, though, is that we are not helpless: standard police vigilance and public alertness can play a role, but the real key to minimizing the damage such people can accomplish is to keep these disaffected individuals from making connections with larger networks.

""Home grown"" terrorists are natives or longtime residents who belong to groups that espouse a particular agenda or radical ideology. ""Lone wolf"" terrorists, on the other hand, usually operate by themselves and are not formally associated with a movement. In either case, they are people who live and move among us every day, secretly working in their basements or garages devising bombs or more dangerous weapons.

Lone wolves can be very hard to find. The Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, lived in a shack in the mountains of Montana during the 17 years he sent 16 package bombs that killed three people and wounded 23 others. Eric Rudolph, who set off bombs at the Olympics in Atlanta, a gay bar and several abortion clinics, was a fugitive in the Appalachians for more than five years before his arrest by a North Carolina policeman in 2003. Timothy McVeigh, with a very small cell of two or three people, was able to build the powerful truck bomb that killed 168 people in Oklahoma City in 1995.

Fortunately, these men, in terms of determination and ability, were the exceptions. Most lone wolves are as incompetent as they are disturbed, and their attacks, like that on Saturday, tend to fizzle out. Even if a lone wolf terrorist is successful, the attack is a calamity for the victims and their families, but without connection to a larger organization, it will not represent a strategic threat to the United States.

So law enforcement has to focus on preventing sophisticated terrorist organizations from establishing a presence within the United States. The good news is that we know how to do this. The bad news is we aren't doing it enough. No other American city even attempts to do what New York has accomplished. The New York Police Department's intelligence and counterterrorism units, working both with the F.B.I. and independently, manage a network of informant and undercover operatives around the area. It was no accident that last year when a Denver man who was planning to bomb the New York subway system arrived in the city, the F.B.I. was aware of his travels, and a radical cleric he met with was already a police informant.

Of course, other American cities don't have a police force with the manpower and experience of ours, but they can still do more. Small cities can act independently or work with the F.B.I.'s 50 or so joint terrorism task forces to set up investigative teams -- just a handful of officers in most cities -- to identify violent cells within their jurisdictions. They know how to do it: the techniques and legal authorities to run informants and undercover agents and to install wiretaps on phones and computers are the same as police departments have long used to infiltrate the mob and drug trafficking organizations.

So why have so few cities done what New York has, even on a smaller scale? Two reasons: money and political risk. Despite great gains across the country in recent years, cities are still under pressure to reduce street crime and are thus reluctant to put their best officers on terrorist investigations that may well come to naught. Many think that counterterrorism is the job, and financial responsibility, of the federal government alone.

In addition, some are wary of the political risk involved in running intelligence investigations against citizens and legal residents who may be involved only in legitimate political dissonance -- a cherished right of all Americans.

But if we are going to prevent the next domestic terrorist attack, we will need to get beyond these concerns. For society as a whole, paying for a handful of detectives at the local level is far more efficient than spending billions inside the Beltway on bloated bureaucracies and large-scale defensive measures that will most likely have little practical effect. And while issues of civil liberties are important, they can be managed with close legal oversight of terrorism investigations.

As the New York case reminds us, there are people out there with the intent to kill. The job of law enforcement is to catch them before they are successful, and if that is not possible, to prevent them from becoming a real strategic threat rather than a small but deadly menace to our society. While we hope we can find lone wolves before they attack, we also need to reduce the threat they pose by identifying, infiltrating and crushing any terrorist organization before it can mount a sophisticated operation, or before it provides deadly technical support and training to the next Times Square bomber.",5,DomesticPolicy,,,,,,,76,111,2009,0.804522949,0.707219697,27.3228794,42.1971093

Busan is near the southern tip of the peninsula, and at the time the area around it was all that was left of the country; the rest had been overrun by the North Koreans. The valley we were in, just north of Daegu, later became known as the ""Bowling Alley.""

I was a second lieutenant in a field artillery unit of the Second Infantry Division and a forward observer, watching for enemy movement and calling in artillery fire.

On my second day of combat, the battery commander ordered me to climb a hill above his location. With me was my sergeant, Warren Truitt, a fine, older non-commissioned officer; my radio operator; and me. At dusk we were joined by four infantrymen.

Around midnight it began to rain, and we were soon drenched. I stayed awake, peering into the night. Around 4 a.m., I heard a bugle in the valley below. We were about to be attacked. But I could not call in fire because we had no idea where friendly or enemy troops were.

Suddenly, I saw a crouching enemy soldier moving up toward us, holding an enormous rifle with a fixed bayonet. He was no more than 25 feet away. I grabbed my carbine, aimed and pulled the trigger.

Nothing happened. My weapon was too wet to function -- a surprise, given that our training instructions said that carbines always worked. I then grabbed my .45 automatic from its holster inside my field jacket and aimed it at the advancing enemy.

The enemy soldier had raised his rifle and was about to shoot when my bullet stopped him cold. As he fell, I saw enough of him to remember the look on his face and recognize his rifle as an old Soviet model.

By now, my companions, fully alert, were firing at other targets down the slope. One infantryman had a rifle with a scope and could pick off enemy soldiers at quite a distance. Our skirmish went on for 20 minutes; finally an infantry platoon came up behind us and chased the North Koreans into the valley.

We made it through without a single casualty. Hand-to-hand combat certainly wasn't part of a forward observer's normal duties. But duty means doing what the moment calls for, whether it's in your assignment or not. During those first, desperate weeks of the war, with the United Nations troops pinned into a corner of the peninsula, very little of what we did was routine.

Should the people choose neither course -- and thereby subject their troops to continuing abuse -- the damage to the army and to American democracy will be severe","Long wars are antithetical to democracy. Protracted conflict introduces toxins that inexorably corrode the values of popular government. Not least among those values is a code of military conduct that honors the principle of civilian control while keeping the officer corps free from the taint of politics. Events of the past week -- notably the Rolling Stone profile that led to Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's dismissal -- hint at the toll that nearly a decade of continuous conflict has exacted on the U.S. armed forces. The fate of any one general qualifies as small beer: Wearing four stars does not signify indispensability. But indications that the military's professional ethic is eroding, evident in the disrespect for senior civilians expressed by McChrystal and his inner circle, should set off alarms.

Earlier generations of American leaders, military as well as civilian, instinctively understood the danger posed by long wars. ""A democracy cannot fight a Seven Years War,"" Gen. George C. Marshall once remarked. The people who provided the lifeblood of the citizen army raised to wage World War II had plenty of determination but limited patience. They wanted victory won and normalcy restored.

The wisdom of Marshall's axiom soon became clear. In Vietnam, Lyndon B. Johnson plunged the United States into what became its Seven Years War. The citizen army that was sent to Southeast Asia fought valiantly for a time and then fell to pieces. As the conflict dragged on, Americans in large numbers turned against the war -- and also against the troops who fought it.

After Vietnam, the United States abandoned its citizen army tradition, oblivious to the consequences. In its place, it opted for what the Founders once called a ""standing army"" -- a force consisting of long-serving career professionals.

For a time, the creation of this so-called all-volunteer force, only tenuously linked to American society, appeared to be a master stroke. Washington got superbly trained soldiers and Republicans and Democrats took turns putting them to work. The result, once the Cold War ended, was greater willingness to intervene abroad. As Americans followed news reports of U.S. troops going into action everywhere from the Persian Gulf to the Balkans, from the Caribbean to the Horn of Africa, they found little to complain about: The costs appeared negligible. Their role was simply to cheer.

This happy arrangement now shows signs of unraveling, a victim of what the Pentagon has all too appropriately been calling its Long War.

The Long War is not America's war. It belongs exclusively to ""the troops,"" lashed to a treadmill that finds soldiers and Marines either serving in a combat zone or preparing to deploy.

To be an American soldier today is to serve a people who find nothing amiss in the prospect of armed conflict without end. Once begun, wars continue, persisting regardless of whether they receive public support. President Obama's insistence to the contrary notwithstanding, this nation is not even remotely ""at"" war. In explaining his decision to change commanders without changing course in Afghanistan, the president offered this rhetorical flourish: ""Americans don't flinch in the face of difficult truths."" In fact, when it comes to war, the American people avert their eyes from difficult truths. Largely unaffected by events in Afghanistan and Iraq and preoccupied with problems much closer to home, they have demonstrated a fine ability to tune out war. Soldiers (and their families) are left holding the bag.

Throughout history, circumstances such as these have bred praetorianism, warriors becoming enamored with their moral superiority and impatient with the failings of those they are charged to defend. The smug disdain for high-ranking civilians casually expressed by McChrystal and his chief lieutenants -- along with the conviction that ""Team America,"" as these officers style themselves, was bravely holding out against a sea of stupidity and corruption -- suggests that the officer corps of the United States is not immune to this affliction.

To imagine that replacing McChrystal with Gen. David H. Petraeus will fix the problem is wishful thinking. To put it mildly, Petraeus is no simple soldier. He is a highly skilled political operator, whose name appears on Republican wish lists as a potential presidential candidate in 2012. Far more significant, the views cultivated within Team America are shared elsewhere.

The day the McChrystal story broke, an active-duty soldier who has served multiple combat tours offered me his perspective on the unfolding spectacle. The dismissive attitude expressed by Team America, he wrote, ""has really become a pandemic in the Army."" Among his peers, a belief that ""it is OK to condescend to civilian leaders"" has become common, ranking officers permitting or even endorsing ""a culture of contempt"" for those not in uniform. Once the previously forbidden becomes acceptable, it soon becomes the norm.

""Pretty soon you have an entire organization believing that their leader is the 'Savior' and that everyone else is stupid and incompetent, or not committed to victory."" In this soldier's view, things are likely to get worse before they get better. ""Senior officers who condone this kind of behavior and allow this to continue and fester,"" he concluded, ""create generation after generation of officers like themselves -- but they're generally so arrogant that they think everyone needs to be just like them anyway.""

By itself, Team America poses no threat to the constitutional order. Gen. McChrystal is not Gen. MacArthur. When presenting himself at the White House on Wednesday, McChrystal arrived not as a man on horseback but as a supplicant, hat (and resignation) in hand. Still, even with his departure, it would be a mistake to consider the matter closed.

During Vietnam, the United States military cracked from the bottom up. The damage took decades to repair. In the seemingly endless wars of the post-Sept. 11 era, a military that has demonstrated remarkable durability now shows signs of coming undone at the top. The officer corps is losing its bearings.

Americans might do well to contemplate a famous warning issued by another frustrated commander from a much earlier age.

""We had been told, on leaving our native soil,"" wrote the centurion Marcus Flavius to a cousin back in Rome, ""that we were going to defend the sacred rights conferred on us by so many of our citizens [and to aid] populations in need of our assistance and our civilization."" For such a cause, he and his comrades had willingly offered to ""shed our quota of blood, to sacrifice our youth and our hopes."" Yet the news from the homeland was disconcerting: The capital was seemingly rife with factions, treachery and petty politics. ""Make haste,"" Marcus Flavius continued, ""and tell me that our fellow citizens understand us, support us and protect us as we ourselves are protecting the glory of the empire.""

""If it should be otherwise, if we should have to leave our bleached bones on these desert sands in vain, then beware of the anger of the legions!""

Stanley McChrystal is no Marcus Flavius, lacking the Roman's eloquence, among other things. Yet in ending his military career on such an ignominious note, he has, however clumsily, issued a warning that deserves our attention.

The responsibility facing the American people is clear. They need to reclaim ownership of their army. They need to give their soldiers respite, by insisting that Washington abandon its de facto policy of perpetual war. Or, alternatively, the United States should become a nation truly ""at"" war, with all that implies in terms of civic obligation, fiscal policies and domestic priorities.

"Anderson, Steven",2010,1,2011-01-13,0,0,1,NYT,Army,,,M,"Save Energy, Save our Troops","Until the Defense Department develops battlefield policies recognizing that energy efficiency contributes to military effectiveness, more blood will be shed, billions of dollars wasted…a new energy efficiency policy would not only save lives and cut costs, it would make a powerful statement regarding the Pentagon's commitment to lowering our dependence on foreign oil. ","A NATO oil tanker truck was blown up by insurgents at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border last week, and while no one was injured, the incident temporarily closed the Khyber Pass, the main supply artery for Western troops in the Afghan theater. This has become an all-too-routine occurrence; in the last nine years some 1,000 Americans have been killed on fuel-related missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Until the Defense Department develops battlefield policies recognizing that energy efficiency contributes to military effectiveness, more blood will be shed, billions of dollars will be wasted, our enemies will have thousands of vulnerable fuel trucks for targets and our commanders will continue to be distracted by the task of overseeing fuel convoys.

As the military's senior logistician in Iraq for 15 months in 2006 and 2007, I tracked the tremendous amounts of fuel needed to power the generators providing electricity for air-conditioning and other essential uses in shelters hastily constructed of canvas, plywood and sheet metal. Today our troops in Afghanistan are furiously building more of the same. Nine years into that war, they are living more or less as Alexander the Great's men did 23 centuries ago -- in often dangerous and always inefficient tents and shacks.

For many in the military, improving the situation isn't a priority. ""To hell with efficiency, effectiveness is all I care about,"" a finger-wagging superior once told me in Iraq. But keeping our bases and units supplied with fuel endangers not just the lives of many soldiers manning the tanker convoys, it also drains $24 billion a year from the Pentagon budget. The solution: a Defense Department policy requiring all structures in the combat zone be energy-efficient.

Upgrading the efficiency at our bases and outposts would not require any new technology. Watch almost any home renovation show and you'll see spray foam being used to cut energy use significantly. Cured spray foam is nontoxic, fire-resistant and waterproof. (Disclosure: until last month, I was the chief operating officer of an energy consulting company, but I have no financial stake in the issue.)

In 2007, an Army study found that spraying foam insulation on the exterior of inefficient structures would reduce their energy requirements by over 80 percent and improve the quality of life for the troops living in them. Accordingly, we obtained the necessary safety, fire and disposal certifications and began a $95 million effort in Iraq; a study last year confirmed this initiative was saving about $1 billion a year and taking more than 11,000 fuel trucks off the road.

Yet, despite three years of quantitative proof that insulated structures in extreme climates tremendously reduce fuel requirements, there has been little effort to broaden the scope of the initiative.

An across-the-board Pentagon efficiency mandate would have many benefits. First, it would save many lives: there are casualties in one out of every 24 fuel supply convoys in Afghanistan; 47 drivers were killed there last year. It would save money; it costs taxpayers about $66 million a day for air-conditioning in the war zones.

It would also reduce opportunities for the enemy. Some soldiers jokingly call the fuel trucks ""Taliban targets,"" and for good reason -- they are a high-payoff quarry for insurgents using nothing but homemade bombs. In addition, having fewer fuel shipments would allow NATO to take highly trained troops off convoy duty and use them in combat or, even better, send them home.

Why has the Defense Department dragged its feet on energy efficiency? Chalk it up to the impediments to change found in any large organization: passive leadership, lack of accountability, competing priorities. In this case, add skepticism over the data, calls for additional studies and unfounded environmental concerns.

But strong leadership can overcome these obstacles, as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates demonstrated in 2008 when he oversaw the acquisition and deployment in Iraq of a new generation of mine-resistant, ambush-protected fighting vehicles, which brought about a decline of up to 90 percent in the deaths of American troops from roadside bombs.

A new energy efficiency policy would not only save lives and cut costs, it would make a powerful statement regarding the Pentagon's commitment to lowering our dependence on foreign oil. We have the finest troops in history; improving the insulation in their structures would not only keep them more comfortable, it would also go a long way to bringing more of them home safely.",7,Warfighting,,,,,,,78,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093

You will find the institute's competent work behind practically every American success in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has undertaken missions from the Balkans and Sudan to the Philippines and Somalia, where I supported the institute's efforts to mediate conflicts, promote the rule of law and encourage democracy.

This week, as the Senate considers alternatives to the House budget bill, we should remember that the stakes for national security and peace-building are high. The institute was created in 1984, when the cold war was still at its height. Congressional leaders guided by Senator Spark M. Matsunaga, a Hawaii Democrat, saw the need for an institution that would strengthen the nation's ability to limit international violence and manage global conflict. President Ronald Reagan signed the act creating the institute. A bipartisan majority of Congress has supported it since -- until now.

The Institute of Peace is like the Marine Corps or special forces for foreign affairs and peace-building. When others are fleeing conflict around the world, you'll usually find institute staff members going in. They were working in Afghanistan before 9/11 and were among the first nonmilitary personnel on the ground after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The institute's headquarters in Baghdad has twice been damaged by rocket and mortar attacks. At the height of the Iraq insurgency, when virtually every other American and international group pulled out their personnel, the State and Defense Departments requested that the institute stay. Under fire regularly, it was the only United States organization outside of those departments that did not flee Baghdad.

But the institute's value goes beyond the bravery and commitment of its staff. In 2007, when the Army's 10th Mountain Division arrived in Mahmudiya, a city of half a million in the ""triangle of death"" dominated by Al Qaeda south of Baghdad, officers asked the institute to mediate between Shiite civil authorities and the Sunni sheiks who controlled the area. Institute-trained negotiators convened warring Iraqis to consolidate security, restore services, develop the local economy, enhance local governance and improve the rule of law. Gen. David H. Petraeus called it a turning point in the war.

In the six months before the institute's intervention, there had been 93 attacks on American forces in the area with homemade bombs; in the six months after, just one. Mahmudiya became a cornerstone of peace in the district, allowing the Army to reduce its strength from a brigade combat team of 3,500 soldiers to a battalion of 650, with corresponding savings and reductions in casualties.

In Afghanistan, the institute conducts mediations on issues from refugees to property and water disputes. In the last year, these operations have resolved 18 tribal disputes throughout the country, mostly involving the abuse of women, and included 30 training programs for government officials, lawyers, mullahs, tribal councils and community leaders. The network is even supporting dialogue along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the earth's most dangerous frontier -- home to Taliban and Qaeda attacks and a wellspring of religious and political extremism.

Congress would be hard-pressed to find an agency that does more with less. The institute's entire budget would not pay for the Afghan war for three hours, is less than the cost of a fighter plane, and wouldn't sustain even 40 American troops in Afghanistan for a year. Within the budget, peace-building is financed as part of national security programs, and is recognized as an important adjunct to conventional defense spending and diplomacy. The institute's share of the proposed international affairs budget, $43 million, is minuscule: less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the State Department's budget, and one-hundredth of 1 percent of the Pentagon's.

The idea that eliminating the United States Institute of Peace would benefit taxpayers is extremely shortsighted and ill informed.

The frequently reviled but rarely understood USA Patriot Act was passed in 2001. Later amended, it allows investigators to get court orders to examine business records in national security investigations by seeking such records from their custodians under Section 215; to focus on a national security target even when they cannot prove that he is affiliated with a particular terrorist organization or foreign power (""lone wolf"" authority); to use ""roving wiretaps"" to track terrorists who switch cellphones frequently; and to get real-time access to the record of incoming and outgoing calls from a particular number (known as a pen register). The Obama administration initially supported leaving these authorities in place but has backtracked - a surprise considering that then-Sen. Barack Obama and then-Sen. Joe Biden voted to reauthorize this legislation in 2006. The threat has only grown, as Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano recently noted.

Business records such as bank or telephone data examined early in an investigation can provide important leads. Details of how such data have been used remain classified, but the information is highly valued by investigators. Roving wiretaps, used for years in narcotics investigations, helped undo the 2009 plot to blow up a synagogue in the Riverdale section of New York. To understand the importance of ""lone wolf"" authority, consider that a computer seized from Zacarias Moussaoui, the ""20th hijacker,"" during the summer of 2001 contained details of the Sept. 11 attacks, though Moussaoui was not known then to belong to a particular terrorist organization.

The current law permitting an intelligence agency to get information through a national security letter (NSL) requires a certification that the information relates to an agent of a foreign power, which would include a terrorist organization. The proposed legislation would remove the presumption of relevance from that showing and require also, before the information is examined, proof of how it relates to an investigation - which is to say, information may be sought only to confirm facts already known, not to investigate and determine what the facts are. The same illogical requirement would be imposed regarding phone records, even though one cannot know how numbers dialed to or from a telephone relate to an investigation until one knows what those numbers are and to whom they belong.

It bears emphasis here that such business and telephone records are information already in the hands of a third party, such as a bank or phone company, so the privacy interest of the subject is weak at best.

Sunset provisions terminating Section 215, roving wiretap, NSLs and ""lone wolf"" authority as of Dec. 31, 2013, are included, even though neither Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri nor Anwar al-Aulaqi is term-limited as of that date. The legislation imposes, for NSLs, additional after-the-fact administrative and judicial review, as well as evaluations by the Justice Department inspector general of the usefulness and importance of intelligence gathered (a judgment that office is not competent to make, institutionally or otherwise). Also, these functions to some extent duplicate oversight already conducted by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.

The net effect of imposing sunset provisions, changing presumptions and adding layers of review and other administrative and judicial burdens on use of these intelligence tools, absent evidence that any of them has been abused - and there has been none - is that intelligence professionals will regard these regimens as transitory. Confidence and initiative will be degraded. The wall between intelligence-gathering and criminal investigation, thought before Sept. 11 to have been required by statute or the Constitution, but realized afterward to have been unnecessary, will be rebuilt. If intelligence bureaucracies are taught that they incur only burdens and risk criticism by seeking to gather intelligence, they will revert to pre-Sept. 11 mode, and await the next cycle of criticism for failing to connect ""dots"" they have been discouraged from gathering. The existing procedures for obtaining even an ""emergency"" authorization under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act already generate reams of documentation through several layers of bureaucracy; there is no need to find out how many more straws the camel's back can bear.",10,Warfighting,1,,,,,Authors are commenting on legislation introduced in the Senate. ,78,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093

President Obama, along with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron, has repeatedly called for the removal of this violent dictator. The objective is clear. And Libya's future is being determined by a civil war, one in which we unarguably have a hand.

In a speech last month at the National Defense University, President Obama carefully distinguished between the administration's approach in Libya and America's experience in Iraq. Referring to overthrowing Gaddafi by force, he stated: ""To be blunt, we went down that road in Iraq. . . . [B]ut regime change there took eight years, thousands of American and Iraqi lives, and nearly a trillion dollars. That is not something we can afford to repeat in Libya.""

For one thing, it is not at all clear whether the president will have the luxury of achieving his political objectives without the application of more force. More important, the president's statement reflects a fundamental misunderstanding that may have serious implications for the way ahead.

Regime change in Iraq did not take eight years. It was accomplished in a matter of weeks. What consumed eight years was the aftermath of regime change: the still ongoing process of transforming Iraq into a self-governing, reasonably secure, democratic society.

Failing to recognize that the hardest part is post-regime change raises the question of whether we have planned for what NATO and others will do if we in fact succeed in our policy objective of showing Gaddafi the door.

Certainly, it would be wonderful if the transitional leadership turns out to be a collection of Thomas Jeffersons and Edmund Burkes who quickly fashion a constitution that embodies freedom and civil rights for all. What we have now, though, as brave and committed as the Libyan opposition might be, is a collection of former regime officials, unelected Benghazi intellectuals and returning expatriate dissidents.

We must acknowledge the real possibility that Gaddafi's departure will be followed by continued violent resistance carried out by his supporters or bloody score-settling by the victorious rebels. The staying power of Gaddafi's forces a month after the NATO intervention began suggests that the current fight, largely seen as democrat vs. oppressor, might have a darker tribal underlay. And with arms now generally available because of the weapons caches that both sides have accessed, a tribal-based round two could be dark indeed.

In the days immediately following the fall of Saddam Hussein, looting and disorder rapidly degenerated into an insurgency. That outcome cannot be excluded as a possibility in Libya. While Egypt has been progressing along a relatively orderly transition to civil society, that process has been overseen by a powerful military, which managed President Hosni Mubarak's exit from power and enforced a disciplined framework for establishing more democratic institutions. Success in Egypt is far from guaranteed, and the army could falter in its self-appointed role, but this is a country with a strong national identity, a national history and strong national institutions.

If Gaddafi falls, it will be because his army and all other existing institutions of national power - corrupt as they might be - have been broken. And at this stage, it is difficult to see what surviving indigenous institution can manage a transition of governance in Libya.

We may tell ourselves that Gaddafi's ouster will end our mission. Optimists can point to the fact that Libya is more ethnically and religiously homogeneous than, say, Iraq, but it is also more tribal than most Arab societies. As brutal as he has been, Gaddafi has still had to respect tribal dynamics to sustain his rule. Is the United States confident that the dominant narrative today, of democrats vs. oppressor, will continue to play out - and will not be overtaken by latent ones such as tribe vs. tribe, haves vs. have-nots or, worse, Islam vs. ""crusaders""?

If disorder and disarray follow Gaddafi's ouster, will humanitarians be prepared to stand by while the blood of retribution is spilled in the streets; or anarchy reigns; or society disintegrates; or a terrorist haven, famine and disease emerge? Whatever one's view about the wisdom of embarking on our coalition effort in Libya, prudence suggests we begin serious planning about what happens when we win - including what effort and resources and time will be required.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,78,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093

But the United States has yet to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. As a result, the United States, the world's leading maritime power, is at a military and economic disadvantage.

The convention codifies widely accepted principles on territorial waters (which it defines as those extending 12 miles out to sea), shipping lanes and ocean resources. It also grants each signatory exclusive fishing and mining rights within 200 miles of its coast (called the exclusive economic zone). Although the United States originally voted to create the convention and negotiated many provisions to its advantage, Congress has never ratified it.

It is the only legal framework that exists for managing international waters; joining it would allow us to secure international recognition of a claim to the continental shelf as far as 600 miles beyond our exclusive economic zone in order to explore and conserve the resource-rich Arctic as the polar ice cap recedes. It would also provide American companies with a fair and stable legal framework to invest in mining projects in the deep seabed.

Ratification makes sense militarily as well. According to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the convention ""codifies navigation and overflight rights and high seas freedoms that are essential for the global mobility of our armed forces."" In other words, it enhances national security by giving our Navy additional flexibility to operate on the high seas and in foreign exclusive economic zones and territorial seas. This is particularly important in the Asia Pacific region and the South China Sea, where tensions among China, Japan and Southeast Asian nations have increased because of conflicting interpretations of what constitutes territorial and international waters.

Perhaps most important of all, ratification would prove to be a diplomatic triumph. American power is defined not simply by economic and military might, but by ideals, leadership, strategic vision and international credibility.

Of course, there are those who would prefer that we have nothing to do with the United Nations, who believe that international treaties hurt our national interests and restrain our foreign policy objectives.

All three of us have struggled while working with and through international organizations -- they are unwieldy and not always responsive to American interests. But as we see in Libya today, the United Nations and other international alliances are indispensable in providing legitimacy and reinvigorating American partnerships in times of crisis. And they will ensure needed balance as rising powers inevitably challenge America's economic and military strength.

Last July, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton gained much respect by reassuring the Southeast Asian nations that the United States strongly supported multilateral efforts to address those territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and denounced China's heavy-handed, unilateral tactics. But strong American positions like that are ultimately undermined by our failure to ratify the convention; it shows we are not really committed to a clear legal regime for the seas.

For all of these reasons, ratification is more important today than ever before.

The charade is over: America has intervened in a civil war with the de facto aim of regime change in Libya. Washington must now accept that decision and face its consequences.","PRESIDENT OBAMAinsists that protecting civilians is the only military objective in Libya and air power is the only means we will use to achieve it. But the Libyan government's attacks on civilians continue, and air power alone will not stop them.

Public pronouncements aside, the unstated strategic aim of the intervention in Libya is to remove Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and his regime, and things are not going well. The United States and NATO must accept that there is no easy way out of this war now that we are in it.

In war, leadership is not exercised from the rear by those who seek to risk as little as possible. Washington must stop pretending that we've passed the leadership for the Libyan operation on to NATO. We did so in Bosnia, claiming Europe would take the lead, only to have the 1995 Srebrenica genocide jolt us back to reality. Like it or not, America's leadership has been crucial to most of NATO's successes. The same will be true in Libya.

We should also have learned from the 1999 Kosovo war that air power alone does not produce victory. There, it took the threat of a ground assault and the erosion of Russian support for Serbia to tip the balance in NATO's favor.

Bombing is extremely effective against targets that are clearly distinguishable from civilians and friendly forces. But Colonel Qaddafi's forces are using a classic defense against air superiority: get as close to your enemy as possible. That means that the use of air power alone has had the perverse effect of putting those forces even closer to the people we are trying to protect. And even the most skilled pilots are ineffective when weather is poor or they are forced to fly high and fast because of shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles.

Advocates of a short-term bombing campaign were wrong. Civilians are not being protected as envisioned, Colonel Qaddafi isn't folding, and as tribes threaten to enter the fray, Libya may be nearing collapse. Washington now has three options -- none of them ideal.

America could pull out, making a tacit admission that the intervention was a strategic mistake. But a resurgent Colonel Qaddafi would likely seek revenge against the rebels and those who helped them. Moreover, NATO's resolve would be called into question, as would America's. Whatever influence Washington might have in the region would evaporate and Al Qaeda would waste no time pointing out that the United States had abandoned Muslims on the battlefield.

Or we could continue doing the minimum necessary to avoid losing. But even if Colonel Qaddafi were to eventually fall, we'd still face the significant and unknown consequences of a postwar Libya. The United States and NATO would not be able to simply leave. We tried this in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it got us an insurgency.

Finally, the United States and its allies could commit the military resources required to genuinely protect Libyan civilians and oust Colonel Qaddafi. Unlike the Bosnian Croats in 1995 and the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan in 2001, the rebel forces in Libya are too disorganized to take advantage of NATO air support. To give them a fighting chance, NATO must put military advisers and combat air controllers on the ground -- not just British, French and Italian, but also a small number of American ones.

These advisers would help bolster the weak rebel army's organization and capabilities while ground controllers could mark targets, identify the forward movement of rebel forces, and distinguish civilians from fighters more effectively than pilots can from their cockpits. Such measures are essential, but they would require relaxing the Obama administration's prohibition on the use of American ground forces.

This course of action would not defeat Colonel Qaddafi's forces overnight, but it would put far more pressure on his regime and potentially protect more civilians in more of the country. If Colonel Qaddafi falls, the United States and NATO will have a responsibility to help shape the postwar order, including providing security to prevent a liberated Libya from sinking into chaos.

After all, the pro-Qaddafi Libyan Army and police are unlikely to provide it; many of them could become insurgents as did Saddam Hussein's forces in Iraq. Nor are the rebels, who may well be more interested in revenge than stability.

The responsibility for security, reconstruction and nation-building will likely fall to the United Nations, which would mean deploying a multinational peacekeeping force in Libya, including troops from the United States, NATO and Arab nations. Washington must start planning and preparing for this complex and expensive contingency and muster the substantial political will required to see it through. While there is no guarantee that such a project will be any more efficient or effective than in Iraq or Afghanistan, failing to plan for it would be disastrous.

So far, we have chosen an instrument -- airstrikes -- that is powerful but cannot attain our humanitarian or strategic aims by itself.

Capabilities such as the Joint Strike Fighter will provide strategic deterrence, in addition to tactical long-range strike, especially when operating from forward-deployed naval vessels.","All our citizens, and especially our servicemen and women, expect and deserve a thorough review of critical security decisions. After all, decisions today will affect the nation's strategic position for future generations.

The future security environment underscores two broad security trends. First, international political realities and the internationally agreed-to sovereign rights of nations will increasingly limit the sustained involvement of American permanent land-based, heavy forces to the more extreme crises. This will make offshore options for deterrence and power projection ever more paramount in support of our national interests.

Second, the naval dimensions of American power will re-emerge as the primary means for assuring our allies and partners, ensuring prosperity in times of peace, and countering anti-access, area-denial efforts in times of crisis. We do not believe these trends will require the dismantling of land-based forces, as these forces will remain essential reservoirs of power. As the United States has learned time and again, once a crisis becomes a conflict, it is impossible to predict with certainty its depth, duration and cost.

That said, the U.S. has been shrinking its overseas land-based installations, so the ability to project power globally will make the forward presence of naval forces an even more essential dimension of American influence.

What we do believe is that uniquely responsive Navy-Marine Corps capabilities provide the basis on which our most vital overseas interests are safeguarded. Forward presence and engagement is what allows the U.S. to maintain awareness, to deter aggression, and to quickly respond to threats as they arise. Though we clearly must be prepared for the high-end threats, such preparation should be made in balance with the means necessary to avoid escalation to the high end in the first place.

The versatility of maritime forces provides a truly unmatched advantage. The sea remains a vast space that provides nearly unlimited freedom of maneuver. Command of the sea allows for the presence of our naval forces, supported from a network of shore facilities, to be adjusted and scaled with little external restraint. It permits reliance on proven capabilities such as prepositioned ships.

Maritime capabilities encourage and enable cooperation with other nations to solve common sea-based problems such as piracy, illegal trafficking, proliferation of W.M.D., and a host of other ills, which if unchecked can harm our friends and interests abroad, and our own citizenry at home. The flexibility and responsiveness of naval forces provide our country with a general strategic deterrent in a potentially violent and unstable world. Most importantly, our naval forces project and sustain power at sea and ashore at the time, place, duration, and intensity of our choosing.

Given these enduring qualities, tough choices must clearly be made, especially in light of expected tight defense budgets. The administration and the Congress need to balance the resources allocated to missions such as strategic deterrence, ballistic missile defense, and cyber warfare with the more traditional ones of sea control and power projection. The maritime capability and capacity vital to the flexible projection of U.S. power and influence around the globe must surely be preserved, especially in light of available technology. Capabilities such as the Joint Strike Fighter will provide strategic deterrence, in addition to tactical long-range strike, especially when operating from forward-deployed naval vessels.

Postured to respond quickly, the Navy-Marine Corps team integrates sea, air, and land power into adaptive force packages spanning the entire spectrum of operations, from everyday cooperative security activities to unwelcome -- but not impossible -- wars between major powers.

","Whether out of malice or ignorance, the DBB would junk all that. By focusing on economy and flexibility, its proposed overhaul would commodify military service. The effect would be to transform profession into trade, reducing long-serving officers and noncommissioned officers to the status of employees, valued as long as they are needed, expendable when they are not, forgotten the day they leave - just like the workers at any GM plant or your local Safeway.","The Defense Business Board (motto: ""Business Excellence in Defense of the Nation""), a panel of corporate types who advise the Pentagon's civilian leadership, has trained its sights on a problem that urgently needs fixing: the military retirement system.

Didn't know it was broken? Well, a recent DBB study concludes that military benefits are ""more generous and expensive"" than those available in the private sector, and have therefore become ""unaffordable"" and ""unfair."" Created back when military skills did not easily translate into civilian second careers, the system is also unnecessary, the study argues. And with retirees no longer dying as quickly as they once did, it's inconvenient to boot.

With the Pentagon facing growing pressure to tighten its belt, the DBB wants to lift a page out of the corporate playbook: ""renegotiate"" (a euphemism for ""reduce"") the benefits package to which the workforce has become accustomed. Of course, the workforce in this case has spent the past decade not pulling shifts on an assembly line or toiling in badly lit cubicles, but rotating between various theaters of war. Remember the old saying ""What's good for General Motors is good for the country""? The updated DBB version should go like this: ""What's good enough for GM employees ought to be good enough for American soldiers.""

What exactly has attracted the DBB's ire? Put simply, the retirement system promises military members half of their pay for life in exchange for 20 years of service, with the percentage of money increasing incrementally for those who serve more than 20 years. In its place, the DBB advocates a 401(k)-type arrangement with service members and the government both kicking in contributions. (The proposal would have no effect on members who, like me, have already retired.)

From the Pentagon's point of view, the plan offers two advantages. First, it promises to save money. Employing what we might call the Afghanistan cost metric (an ACM is the monthly bill for waging the Afghan war, which the Pentagon estimates at $10 billion), military retirees set the government back five ACMs per year. By 2035, absent action taken to reduce these costs, the present system will consume 11 ACMs - almost what it costs to fight in Afghanistan for a single year. According to the DBB, that would ""seriously erode future military capabilities"" - and indeed could make future wars on the scale of Afghanistan too pricey to undertake.

To avert this troubling prospect, the DBB wants the Pentagon to jettison the concept of a lifelong retirement pension. In its place, the board would institute a tax-sheltered savings account to accompany service members into the post-military workplace. Counting on civilian employers to contribute to that account, while stipulating that benefits would be ""payable at age 60 to 65"" rather than at 40 or 45, would reduce the money that the Pentagon is obliged to set aside. In effect, providing for Capt. Smith's retirement would become an individual responsibility, shared by however many employers Smith could induce to pitch in - not a responsibility that the Pentagon alone would have to bear. Less money added to retirement accounts would mean more money for the stuff that matters: wars and weapons.

The DBB reforms also would give the Pentagon greater flexibility in shedding people deemed redundant. The current system makes it ""very difficult to release personnel with 15 or more years of service,"" the DBB laments. Yet it is precisely this group - the field-grade officers and non-commissioned officers who have borne the brunt of the post-9/11 wars - who ""are a likely target for downsizing."" Eliminating career troops short of 20 years, thereby denying them a promised pension, can entail costly and undesirable severance packages.

In contrast, a portable 401(k)-type system can make it easier for the Pentagon to simply hand people their walking papers - much as corporate America routinely does. Baldly asserting that today ""military skills are transferable to the private sector,"" the DBB takes it for granted that former service members will have little trouble finding jobs, ignoring the fact that the unemployment rate for veterans is significantly higher than the national average.

Major savings along with greater managerial flexibility: At a time of massive budget deficits, it seems like a no-brainer. Yet as with many money-saving schemes, this one incurs hidden costs. And as used by the DBB, ""flexibility"" becomes a euphemism for dodging the real issue.

Conspicuously absent from the analysis is this phrase: ""military profession."" Long since diluted elsewhere in American society, the concept of professionalism remains alive and well in the ranks of the armed forces, where an ethos of service and a commitment to a code of personal conduct have survived. In addition to dignifying uniformed service, the military professional ethic helps to ensure that the officer corps is apolitical. Keeping the military out of politics sustains, in part, the principle of civilian control. That is no trivial matter for a country that places so much emphasis on wielding armed might.

Whether out of malice or ignorance, the DBB would junk all that. By focusing on economy and flexibility, its proposed overhaul would commodify military service. The effect would be to transform profession into trade, reducing long-serving officers and noncommissioned officers to the status of employees, valued as long as they are needed, expendable when they are not, forgotten the day they leave - just like the workers at any GM plant or your local Safeway.

""The All Volunteer Force has proven to be an outstanding success,"" the DBB declares as if stating an incontrovertible fact. Yet that force costs a bundle. Trimming retirement outlays appears to offer one way to keep that force fiscally viable. Next on the docket will be cuts in medical benefits. You can count on it.

Over the course of a decade, that all-volunteer force has proved to be astonishingly durable. With only 0.5 percent of Americans bearing the brunt of the nation's seemingly interminable wars - and with the rest of us largely insulated from wars' effects - politicians in Washington have had a free hand in deciding when and where that force will fight. Presidents from both parties have availed themselves of opportunities to do just that. Yet neither of the two big wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, will end in anything like a traditional victory.

Now Washington is under pressure to trim the costs of maintaining that force. Rather than reforming - which really means gutting - the retirement system for the men and women who devote their lives to defending their country, we need to reform - which really means rethinking - the all-volunteer force and what we expect it to do.",6,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,78,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093
"McFarlane, Robert and Woolsey, James",,0,2011-09-21,0,0,1,NYT,Marine Corps,,,M,How to Weaken the Power of Foreign Oil,"The time has come to strip oil of its strategic status. We owe it to those who lost their lives on 9/11 and in its aftermath, and to those whose fate hangs in the balance. ","OUR country has just gone through a sober national retrospective on the 9/11 attacks. Apart from the heartfelt honoring of those lost -- on that day and since -- what seemed most striking is our seeming passivity and indifference toward the well from which our enemies draw their political strength and financial power: the strategic importance of oil, which provides the wherewithal for a generational war against us, as we mutter diplomatic niceties.

Oil's strategic importance stems from its virtual monopoly as a transportation fuel. Today, 97 percent of all air, sea and land transportation systems in the United States have only one option: petroleum-based products. For more than 35 years we have engaged in self-delusion, saying either that we have reserves here at home large enough to meet our needs, or that the OPEC cartel will keep prices affordable out of self-interest. Neither assumption has proved valid. While the Western Hemisphere's reserves are substantial and growing, they pale in the face of OPEC's, which are substantial enough to effectively determine global supply and thus the global price.

According to senior executives in the oil industry, in the years ahead that price is going to rise beyond anything we've seen -- well above the $147 per barrel we experienced three years ago. Such a run-up in the price of oil has been predicted as a consequence of an event like an attack on a major Saudi processing facility that takes production off line. But such a spike would be more likely to be caused by the predictable increase of demand in China, India and developing countries, alongside the cartel's strategy of driving up prices by constraining supply. While OPEC sits on 79 percent of the world's conventional oil reserves, it accounts for only one-third of global oil supply.

There is, however, a way out of this crisis. Ultimately, electric cars may become the norm, but for the near and middle term, the solution lies in opening the transportation fuel market to competition from sources other than petroleum. American oil companies have come around to understanding the wisdom of introducing competition, as a matter of their own self-interest. But doing so means rapidly ramping up production of the alternative fuels, and that is the challenge. As an example, before investors will expand production capacity for cellulosic ethanol from plant life, or for methanol from natural gas -- which on a per-mile basis is significantly cheaper than gasoline -- they want to see that a sufficient proportion of the cars and trucks on America's roads can burn these fuels.

Here too, however, a solution is at hand; it lies in Detroit's making more flex-fuel cars -- cars able to use gasoline, ethanol, methanol or any mixture of these. And because this flex-fuel option costs less than $100 per car, making such a change is not exorbitant. Indeed, some 90 percent of all cars sold in Brazil last year are flex-fuel cars, and many of them were made by Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. That gives Brazilian drivers the option to purchase the most cost-effective fuel, and they can easily switch from one type to another.

But here's the rub. Although the American manufacturers have stated publicly their willingness to make flex-fuel vehicles up to 50 percent of their production, they're just not doing it. Hence the need for Congress to require that new vehicles allow the use of alternative fuels. In some corners of Washington, that raises a cry against ""mandates."" Of course the response to that is: Doing nothing is equivalent to mandating a monopoly by a single fuel (whose price is set by a foreign cartel).

Competition is a bedrock of our American way of life. It's time to introduce it into our fuel market.

That is the purpose of the United States Energy Security Council, a bipartisan group being introduced to the public today in Washington, which includes former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and two former secretaries of defense, William J. Perry and Harold Brown, as well as three former national security advisers, a former C.I.A. director, two former senators, a Nobel laureate, a former Federal Reserve chairman, and several Fortune-50 chief executives (including a former president of Shell Oil North America, John D. Hofmeister).

The crash of October 1929 ended the Roaring Twenties; VJ Day ended World War II. The withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq this month, while less dramatic, also marks the passing of an era.

Launched in 2003 amid assurances of a rapid victory, the war is ending nearly nine years later with the United States settling for considerably less. Undertaken to demonstrate our supremacy, the war has instead revealed the stark limits of American power. It has laid waste to the post-Cold War era of great expectations once thought to define the future.

Remember the 1990s, which opened with the Soviet Union in its death throes and the United States riding high? The Cold War reached a peaceful conclusion, and a new historical chapter, seemingly rich with promise, dawned. Led by the United States - its preeminence affirmed in 1991 by Operation Desert Storm - the world was moving from darkness into light.

While preparing Americans for their first military encounter with Saddam Hussein, President George H.W. Bush heralded the approach of a ""new world order."" Lacking poetry, his formulation never caught on. So in Washington, politicians and commentators were soon vying to provide a more vivid rendering of the age. This effort yielded three broad claims.

The first claim was ideological: The collapse of communism signified the triumph of liberal democracy, a victory deemed definitive and irreversible; viable alternatives for organizing society had ceased to exist. The second claim was economic: The end of the Cold War had unleashed the forces of globalization; with the unimpeded movement of goods, capital, ideas and people, previously unimaginable opportunities for wealth creation beckoned. The third claim was military: Advanced information technology was revolutionizing warfare; armed forces able to exploit that revolution would gain unprecedented effectiveness.

Americans took it for granted that their own approach to democracy should and would apply universally. They believed themselves better positioned than any would-be competitor to capitalize on the promise of globalization. As for high-tech military power, Desert Storm had already testified to American prowess; what some were calling the Revolution in Military Affairs would translate a clear edge into permanent supremacy.

These claims together fostered an exuberance bordering on the ecstatic. ""America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation,"" President Bill Clinton declared in his second inaugural address. As the ""world's greatest democracy"" and with an economy that was ""the strongest on Earth,"" the United States, Clinton predicted, would soon ""lead a whole world of democracies.""

Newt Gingrich's vision tracked neatly with Clinton's. ""No country has ever had the potential to lead the entire human race the way America does today,"" the Republican speaker of the House pronounced in 1996. ""No country has ever had as many people of as many different backgrounds call on it . . . for advice about how to create free government, free markets, and a military that can operate within the rule of law.""

History had rendered a verdict: The future belonged to America and to those who embraced the American way.

For anyone unwilling to accept that verdict, there was U.S. military power. ""The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist,"" journalist Thomas Friedman wrote in 1999. ""McDonald's cannot flourish without McDonnell Douglas, the builder of the F-15. And the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley's technologies is called the United States Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.""

Then came 9/11, which left the almighty superpower looking less like history's architect than its victim. From the outset, President George W. Bush's response to this affront sought not simply to avert further attacks on the American homeland, but to quash suspicions that history might not be tilting in America's direction after all.

""As long as the United States of America is determined and strong,"" Bush assured the nation on Sept. 20, 2001, ""this will not be an age of terror. This will be an age of liberty here and across the world."" As for those obstructing the onset of this age of liberty, the president dismissed them as ""heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century,"" destined to end up ""in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies.""

So the ""global war on terrorism"" was implicitly - even primarily - an American war for global preeminence, waged to validate the claims of Washington's post-Cold War consensus. Removing any doubts about U.S. determination and strength had become an imperative.

This meant unsheathing the hidden fist. After all, 20th-century wars, cold as well as hot, had played a central role in certifying American beliefs and practices. The Bush administration expected war in the 21st century to replicate this achievement. Affirming U.S. military primacy was the key to upholding American ideological and economic prescriptions. Around the world, Washington's writ would become law.

From this perspective, designating Saddam Hussein as Enemy No. 1 made a great deal of sense. Granted, Iraq was not involved in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Hussein's regime had only the most negligible links to al-Qaeda. And, of course, Iraq's stockpile of nuclear and biological weapons turned out to be a figment of fevered imaginations. But critics who employed such facts to charge the Bush administration with deception or incompetence missed a larger point: The real aim of Operation Iraqi Freedom was to demonstrate that the United States still called the tune to which history marched. For such purposes, Hussein's ramshackle regime presented an ideal target.

To choose war is always to roll the dice. In this case, however, given the weakness of Hussein's legions and the self-evident might of the world's sole superpower, the dice seemed loaded. All that remained was to win the inevitable victory and reap the rewards.

And for a tantalizing moment, victory seemed within reach. On March 20, 2003, U.S. forces entered Iraq. On April 9, Baghdad fell. On May 1, Bush, in naval aviator's garb, landed on the deck of the carrier Abraham Lincoln to celebrate what U.S. forces had achieved, with a banner proclaiming ""Mission Accomplished"" providing a backdrop for his remarks.

The 9/11 hijackers had imagined that ""they could . . . force our retreat from the world,"" the president said. ""They have failed."" Rather than retreating, America was on the march, with more victories to follow and history restored to its proper course. Speaking with characteristic certainty, Bush referred to Operation Iraqi Freedom in the past tense.

Yet, in Iraq, complications ensued. The war there had only just begun. It dragged on for years, claiming many victims. Prominent among them was the very future that Americans insisted was all but foreordained.

As measured by the number of U.S. troops killed, maimed or otherwise scarred, the Iraq war ranks as a comparatively modest affair. Even taking into account the far larger number of civilians killed, injured or displaced, Iraq trails well behind the really big wars of the modern era. Not casualties but consequences define the significance of this lamentable episode. There it ranks ahead of Korea and Vietnam - neither marking a decisive historical turn - and even alongside World War II. Back in 1945, the United States had accrued vast stores of moral and political capital. Thanks to Iraq, those stores are now all but depleted.

After Iraq, the future no longer bears the label ""Made in the USA."" In places such as China, alternatives to liberal democracy stubbornly persist and show no signs of flagging. Where demands for democracy sound the loudest - as in the Arab world - the outcome may not favor liberal values. Across Asia, Africa and Latin America, the American model, today damaged and more than slightly tarnished, is only one among several.

Confidence that globalization will (or should) define the economic future has taken a nose dive. While we've been making war, rising economic powers have been making hay, frequently at American expense. At home, meanwhile, deference to the market has produced corruption, recklessness and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Furthermore, even if globalization works for the some, it's by no means certain that it works for the many - a point to which Occupy Wall Street protesters insist on calling attention and one that political leaders ignore at their peril.

Only in the realm of military power has American dominance remained unquestioned, as politicians and generals constantly assert. Yet after years of fighting in Iraq, and with the Afghan war and other ""overseas contingency operations"" continuing, the value of that claim is fading. No doubt U.S. forces have matchless combat capabilities. Yet the sad fact is that they cannot be relied upon to win. Merely avoiding defeat has become a staggeringly expensive proposition.

The beliefs to which the end of the Cold War gave rise - liberal democracy triumphant, globalization as the next big thing and American dominion affirmed by a new way of war - have all come to rest in that unmarked grave reserved for failed ideas. Those who promoted and persisted in the Iraq war wielded the shovel that helped dig the hole. This defines their legacy.",6,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,78,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093
"Jones, James and Grumet, Jason",2007,1,2012-04-10,0,1,0,NYT,Marine Corps,,1,M,Let's Keep Our Hands off the Emergency Oil Supply,"For four decades, the emergency role of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to specifically address large supply disruptions has been a subject of national consensus. We must protect this critical component of our national and economic security and accelerate efforts to protect consumers and the economy from future volatility in the oil markets.","AS oil and gasoline prices rise, political pressure to tap the roughly 700 million barrels in the national Strategic
Petroleum Reserve is building, including among some in Congress. The global oil market is fundamentally strained
and suffering from an array of unwelcome but unremarkable problems. Yet the oil reserve is neither designed nor
well equipped to address these chronic weaknesses. Instead it should be preserved to address an emergency
disruption in supply.
While no one can confidently predict the global oil market, arguments that prices will remain high throughout the
year seem at least as compelling as the more optimistic alternative. Global supplies are tight, and the hope for an
improving global economy will only increase demand. Historically, Saudi Arabia has maintained a cushion of spare
production capacity of about 5 percent of global daily supply. This spare capacity has played a critical role in
calming the market when instability threatens oil-producing nations. That spare capacity is now likely to be only 3
percent, which will make it more difficult for Saudi Arabia to increase production on short notice.
The past year of unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has not resulted in any major supply disruptions, but
roughly 1 percent of global production has come off the market because of diminished production in Sudan, Yemen
and Syria, and the growing impact of United States and European sanctions on Iranian production. If successful,
President Obama's recent decision to press forward with more aggressive sanctions will put pressure on Iran and
strain global oil markets further. Indeed, increased international cooperation in putting the sanctions into effect is
good news in the effort to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear capability.
Iran's total production is now about 3.4 million barrels per day, of which 2 million barrels per day are exported. The
United States Energy Information Administration predicts that the tougher sanctions scheduled to take effect this
summer could cut demand for Iranian oil exports in half. This combination of circumstances, however, does not yet
constitute a severe supply disruption. Using the reserve now would be premature, reduce our national security
options and perhaps even undermine the goal of calming oil markets.
Since its inception in 1975, the oil reserve has been drawn upon under two types of circumstances. There have
been a variety of minor withdrawals unrelated to global market disruptions, including test sales, exchanges to
address minor domestic supply interruptions and even sales in 1996 and 1997 to raise $220 million to balance the
federal budget.
The oil reserve has also been employed three times to address global supply disruptions -- during the first Iraq war,
after Hurricane Katrina, and last year, when President Obama authorized the release of 30 million barrels in
response to the withdrawal of Libyan oil during that country's civil war. In each instance, the releases were
Page 2 of 3
Let's Keep Our Hands Off the Emergency Oil Supply
coordinated internationally, through the International Energy Agency, with some oil offered by the European Union,
the United States and other non-OPEC nations. Each of these emergency releases sought to remedy a discrete
supply reduction and none offer a precedent for a release under the current circumstances.
While the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not an effective tool to address the present circumstances, the president
and Congress must take more strategic and lasting action to protect the public and the economy from the effects of
$100-a-barrel oil and $4-a-gallon gasoline. Despite the traditional election-year rancor, there is actually
considerable bipartisan agreement on what needs to be done. Increasing domestic oil production is extremely
important to our economy and to reducing our trade deficit.
The United States is the third largest oil producer in the world and United States production must continue to play a
critical role in meeting global demand. That production is projected to grow by more than 1 million barrels a day by
2020. If this increase is achieved, the American contribution to the global market will push down global prices and
could enable some increase in global spare capacity.
The Obama administration should continue to accelerate efforts to open new areas for production and encourage
efforts to construct the distribution infrastructure needed to support increased production. However, no amount of
production can insulate the United States from the global market and global price spikes.
The ability to protect our economy from oil price shocks is determined primarily by the amount of oil we use
compared to the size of our economy. In 1975, our economy used 1.2 barrels of oil for every $1,000 of gross
domestic product (2005 dollars); in 2010, we used only half a barrel of oil for the same amount of G.D.P. This
reduction was achieved by moving away from oil in the production of electricity and by substantial increases in fuel
economy.
A diversified energy sector and highly efficient vehicles are strategies supported by a vast majority of Congress.
While it is certain that we will continue to rely on oil for decades, there is considerable support in both parties for
efforts to diversify transportation fuels through research and development and the deployment of biofuels, electric
and natural gas vehicles. All of these actions will continue to increase the oil-efficiency and resiliency of the United
States economy.
For four decades, the emergency role of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to specifically address large supply
disruptions has been a subject of national consensus. We must protect this critical component of our national and
economic security and accelerate efforts to protect consumers and the economy from future volatility in the oil
markets.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,75,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093

In the interim, however, we should reassert a standard of command responsibility that Lincoln would have understood. Yes, when soldiers behave badly, the harsh hand of discipline should fall on individual perpetrators. Yet soldier misconduct expresses professional malpractice at all levels. This epidemic will subside only once we recognize that.","For too long now, command accountability for our troops' misconduct in wartime has been more theoretical than real. The latest scandal to erupt in Afghanistan - photographs of American soldiers amusing themselves with dismembered Taliban corpses - suggests that it's past time to confront this problem.

On the question of accountability, the military's ethic is clear: With authority comes responsibility. More specifically, commanders bear responsibility for everything that happens within their jurisdiction. This decree supposedly applies to high-ranking generals as much aslowly lieutenants.

Once upon a time, the standard for implementing this code was straightforward: Win, and you gain fame and fortune; fail to win, and you're toast. As commander in chief during the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln enforced this standard ruthlessly. As a result, Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman achieved a measure of immortality. Meanwhile, Irvin McDowell, George McClellan, John Pope, Ambrose Burnside, Joseph Hooker and George Meade, among a host of other mediocrities, found themselves unemployed or consigned to lesser positions.

In the post-9/11 era, President George W. Bush abandoned this standard. In 2003, Gen. Tommy Franks presided over a campaign in Iraq that dispersed a pathetic local army even as Franks neglected to consider what might ensue. The answer was not long in coming: chaos and a far uglier and more costly conflict than Americans had bargained for.

Historians will probably place Franks in the company of Burnside and Hooker rather than Grant and Sherman. Yet, for whatever reason, Bush glossed over his field commander's shortcomings, ordained him a great leader and awarded him the Medal of Freedom. Franks had neither won nor lost his war; he had merely mismanaged it and then moved on, washing his hands of the mess. Here was a troubling precedent.

War induces barbarism, and the Iraq war proved no exception. Soon enough, egregious transgressions by U.S. troops surfaced. Abu Ghraib provides one especially notorious example; the massacre at Haditha another. But there were others, now mostly forgotten, at least by Americans - among them the Iraq insurgency's equivalent of the Boston Massacre. In Fallujah on April 28, 2003, with Franks still in command, U.S. troops opened fire on Iraqi demonstrators, killing more than a dozen and wounding several dozen more.

The Pentagon declared each of these an aberration. In each instance, extensive investigation singled out a handful of minions for punishment. In each, senior commanders escaped unscathed. (Abu Ghraib is the partial exception that proves the rule: In the scandal's aftermath, a female Army Reserve brigadier general - not quite a member of the club - lost her star, a fate thus far shared with no male counterpart and no regular officer.)

In an earlier day, this misconduct might not have mattered. When Sherman's troops marched to the sea in 1864, few cared about any atrocities they might commit. The object of the exercise, after all, was not to win Confederate hearts and minds but, as Sherman succinctly put it, to ""make Georgia howl."" Similarly, although the desecration of remains by U.S. troops today pales in comparison with the treatment visited upon Japanese dead during World War II, ensuring that Marines at Peleliu or Okinawa complied with the Hague Conventions did not figure as a priority. Their job was to kill.

Yet, like it or not, our wars differ from those wars. The attenuated definition of command responsibility that prevailed after Sept. 11, 2001, not only let senior commanders off the hook; in wars where killing is not enough, it also compromised overall military effectiveness.

Much to his credit, when Robert Gates became secretary of defense in 2006, he sought to reverse this erosion of senior officer accountability. When the Air Force demonstrated a cavalier attitude toward managing its nuclear inventory, Gates fired the service's chief of staff. When The Washington Post broke a story about wounded warriors warehoused in substandard conditions at Walter Reed, Gates handed both the two-star hospital commander and the three-star Army surgeon general their walking papers.

When Gen. Stanley McChrystal, chosen by President Obama to run the Afghanistan war, sat idly by as members of his staff expressed their contempt for administration officials, he too lost his job. McChrystal himself hadn't said anything all that objectionable. His offense lay in failing to school his loud-mouthed subordinates in the principle of civilian control of the military.

Yet when it comes to misdeeds on or near the battlefield - troops urinating on Taliban corpses, burning Korans, allegedly wandering away from base to murder civilians in cold blood - the pre-Gates norms stubbornly persist. If fault is found, it invariably fixes responsibility and imposes penalties at echelons well below those occupied by the people said to be in charge. The fall guy ends up being the little guy.

Granted, each of these incidents occurs in a context. Protracted conflicts undermine discipline, and those of the past decade have been the longest in U.S. history. Soldiers sent to wage frustrating and almost certainly unwinnable wars to which the public has become indifferent deserve considerable sympathy. The fact that those troops are of a generation seemingly compelled to record and ""share"" their personal experiences - whether quotidian or silly or depraved - offers a further complication. (Marines prying gold teeth out of dead Japanese soldiers did not enshrine their acts on iPhones and send the results to a network of best buddies.)

Furthermore, we should not overstate the reach of command authority. Only someone innocent of actual military experience will imagine that a directive from an American four-star general elicits enthusiastic and universal assent. Orders are often misconstrued, reinterpreted, overlooked or selectively disobeyed - hence, the need to restate them while demanding full compliance.

Yet anyone who cherishes the military professional ethic will see those explanations - whatever their value in providing context - for what they are: excuses for a repeated failure to enforce standards. That failure, which undermines any prospect for mission success, however loosely defined, is ultimately a failure of leadership.

This latest scandal, surfacing on Gen. John Allen's watch, actually occurred in February 2010, when Gen. David Petraeus, then head of U.S. Central Command, had overall responsibility for the war's direction. The revelation dents the image of mastery that Petraeus and his acolytes carefully cultivated. Yet the interval between the act and its becoming public knowledge suggests that this is unlikely to be the last such incident we will have to endure.

The best way to stanch this outpouring of embarrassing news from Afghanistan is to bring our soldiers home, an option that many Americans find increasingly attractive. In the interim, however, we should reassert a standard of command responsibility that Lincoln would have understood. Yes, when soldiers behave badly, the harsh hand of discipline should fall on individual perpetrators. Yet soldier misconduct expresses professional malpractice at all levels. This epidemic will subside only once we recognize that.

Gates understood the basic proposition. Leaders shape institutions. But no leader is irreplaceable - sometimes nothing beats replacing a few near the top to focus the attention of the rest. For an American military well into a second exhausting decade of continuous war, this is one of those times.",6,CivMilBalance,,,,,,,75,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093
"Clark, Wesley and Hunt, Swanee",2000,1,2012-05-04,0,1,0,NYT,Army,,1,M,Bosnia Still Needs Fixing,"The 1995 Dayton agreement ended the worst bloodletting in Europe since World War II. The warring factions were brought together only with enormous pressures and incentives from the outside, including military strikes and the promise that other countries would continue to enforce the peace and extend economic assistance. The agreement provided for early elections and set up an unusual political structure, but it was imperfect. We knew that then.","IN the Bosnian city of Mostar, a beautiful Ottoman-era limestone bridge called the Stari Most arched over the
Neretva River for 427 years, surviving earthquakes and two world wars. After a barrage of shelling in 1993, during
the Bosnian civil war, the bridge collapsed. Citizens were stranded on opposite sides of the riverbank. Ethnic strain
wasn't the cause. It was the effect. Across the country, the war itself was dividing citizens into three ethnonationalist
clusters: Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks). Twenty years after the war
began, and 17 years after the Dayton accords brought the fighting to an end, the bridge stands again, and a
shallow peace prevails.
But now, the compromises we made to end the killing increasingly look inadequate, and it's time to begin fixing
them.
Mostar is still split: the west bank is primarily Croat, the east Bosniak. It is one city, but it has separate universities,
postal services, health care systems and phone networks -- and it can't agree on how to elect a city council.
Political institutions that were supposed to reconcile a divided society are ineffective; ethnic quotas at all levels of
government breed nepotism; children study in classes divided according to their parentage; economic development
has stagnated. And the populace feels angry and hopeless about the future.
Meanwhile, the international community has mostly turned its back on its own handiwork.
The 1995 Dayton agreement ended the worst bloodletting in Europe since World War II. The warring factions were
brought together only with enormous pressures and incentives from the outside, including military strikes and the
promise that other countries would continue to enforce the peace and extend economic assistance. The agreement
provided for early elections and set up an unusual political structure, but it was imperfect. We knew that then.
Still, it was the best we could achieve, and, as the late Richard C. Holbrooke said at the time, the most important
thing was to stop the killing.
In retrospect, we can see how some of Bosnia's difficulties are our own fault. Early on, we had too simply labeled
the violence as a clash of ethnic groups, roughly equal in their responsibilities to reconcile, when in fact they had
been manipulated toward war primarily by Serbian nationalist leaders. We had ignored Bosnia's experience before
1992, when its citizens from different ethnic groups were very often friends, colleagues, neighbors and spouses --
and even during the war, when there were immeasurable acts of generosity across the ethnic divides. Had we
Page 2 of 3
Bosnia Still Needs Fixing
outsiders realized that the violence was not inevitable, and had we been willing to name Serbs as the primary
aggressors early in the war, NATO forces could have intervened much earlier and saved tens of thousands of lives.
But we came in late, and by the time we did, hatred and fighting had shaped the political and military balances we
had to work with. That produced an agreement that institutionalized ethnicity as the deciding factor in political and
social identity. It divided power and representation according to whether citizens were Bosniaks, Serbs or Croats,
leaving little room to organize along other lines -- for example, gender and level of urbanization.
Today, as set out at Dayton, Bosnia's presidency is a triumvirate; each of the three members must be identified with
one of the so-called constituent peoples. This slows down decision making and excludes minorities, as well as the
large number of Bosnians who don't identify with one of the major groups. In fact, two would-be presidential
contenders, a Roma and a Jew, won a ruling in the European Court of Human Rights in 2009 that required
constitutional revisions that would give neglected minorities equal opportunities to serve in government. Three
years later, that reform is still being debated by Bosnian political leaders, who owe their positions to the status quo.
Dayton also divided the country itself into two separate statelets -- a Bosniak-Croat federation and a Serb republic --
governed by the same legislature and presidency. At the time, many Bosnian women's groups, religious leaders,
civil society activists and students warned that the arrangement wouldn't work because the country historically had
been integrated. But they weren't at the negotiating table; only those with the power to fight or to lay down their
weapons were invited.
In retrospect, perhaps we could have done better to engage politically unrepresented groups who craved stability,
so that they could sit alongside those who knew how to fight.
The compromises at Dayton stopped the killing, but also helped perpetuate the ethnic chauvinism, fear and greed
that had set it off. And now, the international community bears some responsibility to keep Bosnia from ever
relapsing into violence. We also must help Bosnians fashion a better political system, one that promotes national
unity, effective decision making and democratic participation.
Three moves would make a huge difference.
First, the American and European governments must help Bosnia change the Constitution we helped create.
Second, after the Constitution has been revised, the European Union should reward Bosnia by granting it
membership. Serbia, after all, was given candidate status -- a critical step toward full membership -- in March, and
Croatia is scheduled to become a full member next year. Europe should also extend more financial and technical
assistance to implement the reforms needed to re-establish a pluralistic society and secure candidate status for
Bosnia (which the European Union treats as a ''potential candidate'' for membership).
Third, NATO needs to offer the country a clear path for joining the alliance; it will have an opportunity to do so later
this month when NATO holds a summit meeting in Chicago. Many Bosnians of all ethnicities look at membership in
NATO as a guarantee of security, prosperity and stability. In addition, the military is the one Bosnian institution in
which ethnic differences have mattered least; recently, when Serbian veterans' benefits were cut, Bosniak veterans
raised money to give to the people who once fought against them.
We also need to encourage and support the kind of moderate high-level and grass-roots leaders we overlooked
during the negotiations 20 years ago. They are the real heroes of the war -- and of the peace.
One such person is Kada Hotic, a leader of Bosnian Muslim survivors of the war. Only last June, she was finally
able to bury three small bones -- the only remains that could be identified of her son, who died in the infamous
massacre of Muslims by Serbian fighters in 1995.
Yet Ms. Hotic offers: ''Maybe one day we can close the story of war and move toward genuine reconciliation.
Everyone has suffered. When those men killed my son, they killed themselves. I forgive them, and so I live.''",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,75,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093

Every veteran deserves access to treatment for the trauma he or she experienced while defending us. And every veteran deserves the chance to live a life of dignity in the country whose freedom he or she helped secure.,"Our nation is finally emerging from one of the worst recessions in U.S. history, yet for our military veterans there is no recovery in sight. The nation's unemployment rate is 8.1 percent. But the unemployment rate of our youngest military veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan hovers at a stunning 29 percent.

Consider that: Nearly one in three Americans who fought to defend us in distant lands cannot find a job here at home.

And the problem is about to get a lot worse. With the war in Iraq over and the mission in Afghanistan winding down, and the imperative of getting our national debt under control, Congress and the administration are reducing military spending. Under current plans, at least 100,000 men and women will leave military service in the next five years. Last fall political leaders failed to reach agreement on a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit. As a result, the Defense Department budget could be slashed by an additional $600 billion beginning in January - cuts that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has called ""catastrophic."" They could result in even more service members being pushed out the door in coming years. We should start preparing for this influx of new workers in the job market.

America's veterans are a tremendous human capital resource. They are responsible, hardworking and loyal. They possess strong leadership skills and a work ethic that would be valued at any place of business. They have also benefited from technical training and education that is second to none. An Army logistics manager who moved billions of dollars of equipment and tens of thousands of personnel into and out of war zones is perfectly positioned to help a U.S. business move goods and services for its customers. Regrettably, many employers still do not appreciate how the skills our veterans hone on and off the battlefield can help their businesses win here at home. We need to show them and offer them tools to better incorporate veterans into the workplace.

We also need to help our veterans address another roadblock to employment: access to treatment for the trauma of war. Some of those returning from combat zones suffer from depression, trauma and post-traumatic stress. These are treatable conditions, and we've learned a lot about how to help people cope with them. But many vets never get the treatment they need - and the families who suffer alongside them, and whose support is essential to successful treatment, are ineligible for care from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Without proper support, it is little wonder some vets have trouble finding or holding down jobs. When they are unable to find work, they can also lose their homes. Twenty percent of New Yorkers sleeping on the streets are veterans, according to the city's Department of Homeless Services. Many of these men and women fought for us in the mountains of Afghanistan and the deserts of Iraq. It is unacceptable that they are now homeless.

The struggles our veterans face are such that 18 of them commit suicide every day, according to recent reports. That is more than 6,500 suicides per year. As of last week, 6,414 U.S. service members have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. In other words, suicide kills as many of our troops in one year as our enemies have killed in the past decade.

Addressing the challenges of our veterans must be a national priority. After our country was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, these young men and women stepped forward to serve. They volunteered to put on the uniform, knowing the dangers that come with military service. Because of their courage, we have gone nearly 11 years without another successful terrorist attack on our soil.

Americans are grateful for their service - but our gratitude is not enough. The Robin Hood Foundation is convening a summit of military and business leaders, mayors, members of Congress, veterans and others on Monday to address veterans' challenges in finding the work, homes and treatment they need.

Every veteran deserves the chance to provide for his or her family. Every veteran deserves access to treatment for the trauma he or she experienced while defending us. And every veteran deserves the chance to live a life of dignity in the country whose freedom he or she helped secure.

"McChrystal, Stanley ",2010,1,2012-05-20,0,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,From Forward Operating Base to Boardroom,"And businesses need the experience, skills, and mindset that veterans have to offer.","Wanted for hire: Enterprising, reliable self-starter. Must work well in teams. Technological literacy and leadership
experience a plus.""
This notice could be posted by many businesses today as they look for employees to help them survive, and
thrive, in difficult economic times.
Such employees abound in small forward operating bases in the crags of Konar, and before that in parched
Anbar; on anti-piracy missions off the coast of Somalia; and in Africa, South America and Asia, where in
dangerous conditions they dispense humanitarian aid, medicine and training in our name, under our flag.
Luckily for American industry, it will soon have access to this talent pool: Over the next five years, more than one
million military service members will leave active duty and return to their communities. Their return presents
America not just with an important test of our values, but with an extraordinary opportunity—both to ensure our
future and revitalize our economy.
In May 2009, just before deploying to Afghanistan, I read a dispatch that affirmed my faith in the strength and
initiative of the young men and women I was soon to lead. It described a young lance corporal, Rolando Cabezas,
who was the fire team leader in his Marine infantry unit.
One morning, shortly after Lance Cpl. Cabezas and his team moved into Farah, in southwestern Afghanistan, a
farmer approached the Marines. The farmer wanted to dig an irrigation ditch underneath a main road, to connect
his fields to water on the other side. But he feared that the Marines, seeing him dig beneath the road, would think
he was implanting an improvised explosive device, or IED—the hidden bombs that have been so deadly to our
forces.
The Marines sent out a patrol to stand watch and guard the farmer as he dug. Once there, Lance Cpl. Cabezas
greeted the farmer with a few Pashto phrases he had taught himself in his spare time. As fire team leader, he was
responsible for the Marines he led and for thousands of dollars of sensitive equipment, and he was trained to run
autonomous operations. But he instinctively recognized that the wider mission, beyond the team he was
responsible for, required earning the trust and respect of the Afghan people. No task was beneath him if it meant
advancing the mission.
So, to the amazement of the Afghan farmer already wowed by the American's Pashto, Lance Cpl. Cabezas
removed his helmet, grabbed a shovel and began to help dig.
Soon the other Marines joined. They helped make the construction strong enough to support traffic, using their
large, multi-ton mine-resistant vehicle to smooth over the road and pack it down so that the farmer's ditch would
not cave in under passing trucks. At a local gathering soon thereafter, the farmer extolled the Marines and his
""son""—Lance Cpl. Cabezas, who did more to win the crucial support of the population than did millions of dollars
that were poured into road projects in that area.
Rolando is representative of the millions of young men and women who have served in our wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan. He exemplifies the courage and clear-eyed common sense that has been required of our soldiers
during the past decade of war. Those traits, and the training that cultivated them, make these veterans huge
assets in a business environment: They are adaptable and reliable, and they work with a sense of mission.

For current missions and future threats, we need the military to continue to attract the best the country has to
offer. And when their service in uniform is done, we need to ensure veterans are recognized as assets to our
communities, companies, schools and government. Most importantly, we need to have their backs. And the best
way to show appreciation to our service members is to hire them.
That's why, as an adviser to Joining Forces, the White House's initiative to promote awareness of issues military
families face, I am proud to support the ""Got Your 6"" campaign. Inspired by First Lady Michelle Obama's call to
action and named for the military parlance meaning ""I've got your back,"" this campaign is a collaborative effort
that involves every major movie studio, television network, talent agency and union, plus more than two dozen
nonprofit partners.
More and more companies are benefiting from veterans' extraordinary reservoir of skill, leadership, work ethic and
maturity. Veterans are problem-solvers trained to take whatever task is given to them, then plan and execute it to
the highest standards possible. They do so through teamwork, loyalty and selfless focus on completing the
mission. Most military members are given a high level of responsibility and leadership training at a relatively
young age. After working with Americans of all stripes, and living in and working with different cultures, they are
uniquely prepared to be part of a globalized workforce.
In the year since Joining Forces was launched, more than 1,600 companies have hired over 70,000 veterans and
military spouses. Companies have pledged to hire an additional 170,000 in the coming years.
Even so, roughly 195,000 post-9/11 veterans remain unemployed. Veterans need the support of American
businesses. And businesses need the experience, skills and mindset that veterans have to offer.",10,Support,,,,,,,75,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093
"Nagl, John",2008,1,2012-06-06,0,1,0,NYT,Army,,,M,The Age of Unsatisfying Wars,"Like any successful counterinsurgency, Afghanistan is likely to end somewhat unsatisfyingly for Americans, with a corrupt but gradually improving government in Kabul, advisors helping Afghan security forces fight a weakening but still dangerous Taliban, and a schizophrenic Pakistan alternately helping Afghan and Taliban fighters.","THIS Memorial Day, President Obama recognized veterans of all of the nation's wars, but focused on two: the war
in Iraq, which came to an end, for Americans, this past year, and the Vietnam War, which began, for Americans, 50
years ago.
Mr. Obama was quiet, however, about the war in Afghanistan, the one for which he will be remembered in military
history. Perhaps that's because things in Afghanistan are still muddled; will it end like Vietnam -- an abject,
helicopters-flying-out-of-Kabul, people-hanging-on-the-skids defeat -- or in an unsatisfying and untidy sort-of victory,
like Iraq?
From a traditional point of view, neither option seems particularly attractive. But Mr. Obama should welcome an
Iraq-like end to Afghanistan: as contradictory as it may seem, messy and unsatisfying are the hallmarks of success
in modern counterinsurgency wars.
America can live, for example, with the current Iraqi government and its policies, and Iraq's increasing oil output will
help the global economic recovery. This is an unsatisfying return on the blood and treasure we poured into Iraq, but
it is not a complete loss -- and it is far better than we could have imagined in 2006, when Iraq was descending into
civil war and Al Qaeda had established an important foothold there.
It is not unlikely that 2015 will see a similarly reasonable Afghan government that will hold together with American
money and advisers -- an unsatisfying end, but not a failure, and not without promise of greater stability to come.
Unsatisfying wars are the stock in trade of counterinsurgency; rarely, if ever, will they end with a surrender
ceremony and look like a conventional victory. And yet this is the sort of war we have fought, almost exclusively, for
over 50 years. President John F. Kennedy warned those graduating from West Point in 1961 that they would
struggle to defeat insurgent enemies: ''Where there is a visible enemy to fight in open combat, the answer is not so
difficult. Many serve, all applaud, and the tide of patriotism runs high. But when there is a long, slow struggle, with
no immediately visible foe, your choice will seem hard indeed.''
The choices of that West Point class, and of those that would follow it into a counterinsurgency campaign in
Southeast Asia, were more difficult than their young president could imagine. Although the Army made real
Page 2 of 3
The Age of Unsatisfying Wars - Correction Appended
progress in understanding and implementing counterinsurgency principles under Gen. Creighton W. Abrams Jr., the
lesson of Vietnam was not to fight irregular wars in Asia.
The Army learned that lesson all too well, forgetting what it had learned in the jungle and focusing on a conventional
war with the Soviet Union. The Army and Marines quickly destroyed Saddam Hussein's military in 2003, only to find
themselves facing an enemy they should have expected: insurgents, some inspired by radical Islam, but many
more by simple nationalism.
Hard lessons in counterinsurgency had to be relearned before Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and Gen.
David H. Petraeus implemented a strategy that combined fighting with negotiations. The 2007 surge, employing
new counterinsurgency tactics, and the mindless brutality of the insurgent group Al Qaeda in Iraq persuaded the
Sunni tribes to ''flip'' and start fighting the radicals rather than Americans.
The surge changed the war in Iraq dramatically, even as Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, was
promising to swing resources away from Iraq and into the ''good war'' in Afghanistan. President Obama fulfilled his
campaign promise and then some, tripling American forces in Afghanistan during his first year while also doubling
down on drone strikes in Pakistan.
Again, the strategy, aided by the killing of Osama bin Laden by a Navy SEAL team, worked to a degree. With Al
Qaeda effectively dismantled, a government that is good enough to run the country is likely to be sufficient to
achieve core American national security objectives as well.
Like any successful counterinsurgency, Afghanistan is likely to end somewhat unsatisfyingly for Americans, with a
corrupt but gradually improving government in Kabul, advisers helping Afghan security forces fight a weakening but
still dangerous Taliban, and a schizophrenic Pakistan alternately helping Afghan and Taliban fighters.
It may also, in the odd logic of counterinsurgency, be more likely to succeed if we leave the project somewhat
unfinished. T. E. Lawrence, no slouch as an insurgent himself, advised: ''Do not try to do too much with your own
hands ... It is their war, and you are to help them, not to win it for them.''",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,75,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093

Yet the number of affected individuals is too great -- and their mental-health challenges in particular too demanding -- to leave the VA on its own in this mission.

Instead, a major new private-public partnership is necessary. The federal government should be willing to reimburse private practitioners who take care of veterans or their families, expedite paperwork procedures to make this feasible, and involve the academic and other national networks that are already serving veterans.

Today, too many returning soldiers with mental-health problems do not get timely help. There is a backlog at the VA of nearly one million cases simply for processing claims for disability benefits. Patients who apply for help often must wait weeks or even months until their first treatment visit. And family members of veterans who also need help cannot routinely get it through the VA system.

Some two million Americans have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many have reported mental-health problems already; many more will do so in the years ahead. As of early June, according to the Pentagon, since the beginning of 2012 suicides in the U.S. armed forces have exceeded the number of combat fatalities in Afghanistan. These tragic endings to the lives of American patriots can often be traced back to inadequately addressed mental-health challenges such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury. Recent veterans are coming to the VA at a time when the Vietnam-era caseload remains extensive.

There is still time to save thousands of those who might take their own lives, as well as tens of thousands of those who, without adequate treatment, might be afflicted by fear, anger, dysfunctional mood swings, and the inability to hold jobs or sustain relationships. Many fine groups, such as Welcome Back Veterans and Wounded Warrior associations, are working hard to help. But a larger fraction of the country needs to get involved.

Just before 9/11, the Department of Veterans Affairs budget was $47 billion. It is now $125 billion. The vast majority of VA resources have been well spent, and the government has been trying to hire enough psychologists, psychiatrists and claims processors to address the patient backlog. But many of the best providers have established practices and may prefer to deal with a broader set of mental-health conditions than are commonly represented among the nation's military veterans. Others simply do not want to work for the government.

This deprives Veterans Affairs of great expertise that lies in the nation's research hospitals and universities, where major strides are being made in mental-health care. We need to tap this expertise to care for as many veterans as they have the time and inclination to help. We also need a way to care for family members whose mental problems -- such as depression and even PTSD caused by the repeated deployment of a loved one -- often become just as severe as those of the veterans, back from war, who are not quite the same people they once were.

Taking this approach would dramatically expand our treatment capacity overnight. The capabilities exist, the people are trained, and many are enthusiastic about giving back a little to those who have done so much for all of us.

Dr. John Greden, director of the University of Michigan Depression Center and chairman of the National Network of Depression Centers, heads a private-public team of academic, VA and National Guard partners that have aided returning veterans and their family members for five years. ""The Veterans Affairs Mental Health system is indispensable,"" he says. ""But so is greater involvement of the rest of the vast American health system.""

There are several working models of cooperation between the Department of Veterans Affairs and public teaching institutions and hospitals. One example is the collaboration between New York University Langone Medical Center and the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System. Another is the collaboration between Mt. Sinai and the Bronx VA hospital. Both programs provide treatment for veterans' families.

Our armed forces and their families have made great sacrifices on behalf of the nation. Many of them need more of our help. They have given so much and deserve no less.",10,Support,,,,,,,75,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093
"Collins, Michael",1982,1,2012-09-13,0,1,0,WaPO,Air Force,,,M,The Neill Armstrong I Knew,,"Before manned space flights began, officials pondered what background they should seek in the crew for this bizarre new venture: Danger lover? Bullfighter? Mountain climber? Should they search for people who were self-aware and calm in extreme conditions? A deep-sea diver, perhaps? Finally, they settled on — and President Dwight Eisenhower supported — experimental test pilots, people who had already guided complex new flying machines. Thus the original seven astronauts were selected in 1959.

In 1962 I was a budding test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California — our Mecca — and much interested in joining NASA’s second crew selection. Pondering the competition, I wrote to my father on April 19 that “Neil Armstrong will be on the list . . . because he has by far the best background.” Neil, a former Navy fighter pilot, was a combat veteran employed by NASA at Edwards. He was testing new Air Force and Navy aircraft, as well as rocket ships. His flights in the rocket-powered X-15 alone put him a stratosphere above the rest of us.

It was no surprise that Neil advanced to make the first docking in space, as commander of Gemini 8, and then moved to Apollo, where Buzz Aldrin and I joined his crew. By then he had proven his technical competence many times over, but I didn’t really know the man behind the reputation.  Neil, who will be memorialized Thursday at the National Cathedral, always seemed serious and businesslike, but you could make him laugh if you tried. It was real laughter, because Neil did not pretend. He was genuine through and through. He signaled displeasure with silence, never an outburst. He had high standards and stuck to them.

The best way to get Neil talking was to start with airplanes. He knew more about planes than anyone I’ve ever met, real ones and children’s models. We both were model builders from an early age, and we always wanted them to go higher and faster. My solution? Another few turns on the rubber band. Neil’s? Build a wind tunnel.

Wind tunnels are serious, high-tech business but one that Neil turned into fun. Before putting power to the tunnel he built in the basement, Neil invited his grandmother to stand in front of it. When he threw the switch, the wind blew her housecoat off.Neil was smart as hell — and an encyclopedia of knowledge of things far beyond air and space. He trotted out tidbits on occasion. After the flight of Apollo 11, we went on a world tour. One evening we found ourselves in Yugoslavia at a formal dinner hosted by Marshal Tito and his wife, Madame Broz. The small talk got smaller and smaller, with madame doing a fine imitation of an Easter Island monolith: frozen, staring straight ahead. Neil bent over and started talking quietly to her, and when I strained to listen, I was astounded that he was talking about Nikola Tesla, the early electric genius and competitor of Thomas Edison. Had Neil lost his mind? No, Madame Broz lit up like a thousand-watt bulb, and from then on we were all buddies, including even the taciturn Tito. Later I asked Neil about his choice of topic. “Oh,” he replied offhandedly, “she is related to Tesla.”

Once, while visiting a museum in Italy, Neil drew a crowd — not because he was recognized as that man on the moon but because, standing with friends before a case of Leonardo da Vinci’s model machines, he explained their intricacies in such detail that passersby assumed he was an English-speaking tour director and stopped to listen.

After the publicity of the Apollo flights died down, Neil’s quiet demeanor was criticized. Some faulted his reticence, wanting an advocate to get out and sell the space program. But by holding to his lifelong yardsticks of honesty, humility and grace, Neil did more than any salesman or huckster. Some called him a recluse, but I think they were wrong. He supported numerous causes, especially those sponsored by the National Academy of Engineering and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, our professional society. When other Apollo flights were honored, Neil usually showed up, making the point that Apollo 11 had depended on their accomplishments. In recent years, he visited Iraq and Afghanistan. He even led cheers at a football game at his beloved alma mater, Purdue University. If this is a recluse, our nation needs more of them — people who don’t seek the limelight but can live competently in its glare, people who are the antithesis of some of today’s empty-headed celebrities.Neil was the consummate decision-maker, which is what you look for in a mission commander. He made decisions slowly, pondering their outcome if time allowed but acting decisively when necessary. For his lunar landing he picked his spot carefully, bypassing boulder fields. When he finally set down, he had less than a minute of fuel remaining. Good decisions all the way.

Age treated Neil well. As more accolades came his way, he took them in stride. He never showed a trace of arrogance, and he had plenty to be arrogant about. It was refreshing to see him as modest as ever. When my wife, Pat, and I had lunch with Neil and his wife, Carol, this spring, he seemed relaxed, cheerful, contented, happy. I like to remember him that way. He deserved all the good things that came his way. He was the best, and I will miss him terribly.",8,Support,,,,,,,75,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093
"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2012-10-02,0,1,0,WaPO,Air Force,,,M,When Intel Meets the Political Debate,"Even in the best of times, the burden on intelligence is heavy, as it is the intelligence professional's task to get into the heads of policymakers and deepen the officials' understanding. That must be done without breaking the linkage to his fact-based, dark, inductive, world-as-it-is roots. Often this means making life more difficult and more complicated for the policymaking consumer.","The intersection of intelligence reporting and policymaking is tricky.

I've often likened the dynamic to a room in which intelligence and policy must meet, though each enters through different doors. Intelligence professionals bring to the conversation facts, data and evidence; thinking inductively, they try to use them to draw generalized conclusions. They should see the world as it is and, consequently, find it hard to escape a generally pessimistic attitude.

Policymakers, on the other hand, tend to be more optimistic, envisioning the world as we would want it to be, thinking deductively as they try to apply a set of generalized principles - the ones that got them elected - to specific situations.

Even in the best of times, the burden on intelligence is heavy, as it is the intelligence professional's task to get into the heads of policymakers and deepen the officials' understanding. That must be done without breaking the linkage to his fact-based, dark, inductive, world-as-it-is roots. Often this means making life more difficult and more complicated for the policymaking consumer.

This is especially true when policymaking blends into partisan electoral politics and the interpretation of intelligence becomes part of the political debate.

That's a minefield in which few intelligence professionals would want to wander, so many were surprised last week when the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) seemed to voluntarily enter the fray with a news release broadly outlining the course of intelligence assessments of the Sept. 11 attack on two U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, and the death of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.

It was an unusual step. To be sure, then-CIA Director George Tenet took public responsibility for allowing President George W. Bush to utter the infamous ""sixteen words"" in his 2003 State of the Union address that repeated a British claim that Iraq was seeking uranium for its nuclear program. That instance was about a claim that the U.S. intelligence community could not support and, by its own admission, should have stopped.

In another instance, as Director Leon Panetta was taking command of the CIA in 2009, I used one of my exit interviews with him to point out that - campaign rhetoric to the contrary - the Bush administration had not ""cooked"" the conclusions of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Panetta needed to know that the intelligence community had just gotten it wrong. But that was a private discussion.

Last week's statement from the ODNI was public and - whatever its intent - seemed well suited to give the administration cover for its early claims that the Benghazi attacks were spontaneous and almost random, the product of rage over an Internet video rather than a targeted and purposeful attack by a potentially resurgent al-Qaeda.

A summation by McClatchy Newspapers was typical; beyond updating the public, it reported, the ODNI statement appeared to be an effort at ""shielding the White House from a political backlash over its original accounts.""

Having voluntarily stepped into this public furor, the ODNI is likely to face more questions.

Some will deal with process. Did the idea for the statement originate with the ODNI? Would such a news release have gone forward absent White House approval of the concept? Was the text shielded from White House review before publication? Was Congress consulted or even informed? If the answer to any of these questions is no, the document - whatever its intrinsic merits - will be vulnerable to being labeled political.

There are also questions about the quality of the assessment. The release says that originally ""there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously."" What was the evidence of spontaneity? One must not confuse the absence of evidence of prior planning with evidence of the absence of such planning.

And how does spontaneity comport with the use of heavy weapons, indirect fire and sequential assaults against two separate installations? These circumstances are what prompted House intelligence committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) to characterize the attacks early on as ""a planned, coordinated event."" It was probably these same circumstances - known soon after the attack - that caused White House spokesman Jay Carney to belatedly admit that it was ""self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.""

The ODNI release noted that ""as we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment."" When? After attacks, there are usually competing hypotheses about what happened. When did the case for ""deliberate and organized"" begin to challenge and overtake ""spontaneous""?

What were the relative strengths of the arguments when U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on Sunday talk shows, labeling the events as spontaneous and not premeditated, to be followed 72 hours later by the director of the National Counterterrorism Center unequivocally labeling them terrorist attacks?

These are not unfair questions. As they are answered, it will be essential for intelligence officials - even after having publicly entered this fray - to keep in mind the ""door"" through which they still enter this process.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,75,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093

(Al Qaeda in Iraq has doubled in size in the year since U.S. troops left the country.)

68,000 U.S. troops there at all. Sure, the Obama administration says they'll be out ""on schedule"" in 2014, but
can't the U.S. immediately pull back and protect its interests with drones and special-operations forces alone?
To better understand the battle in Afghanistan, look to Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Sinai, Syria or Iraq—all places
where al Qaeda and associated groups are a growing presence. (Al Qaeda in Iraq has doubled in size in the year
since U.S. troops left the country.) These terrorists have already killed Americans, and they have planned and
executed several attacks on the U.S. homeland that have failed only thanks to technical problems or outstanding
police work.
While not the catalyst of the Arab Spring, al Qaeda and its friends are seeking to take advantage of the
opportunities posed by revolutionary change throughout the Middle East. Despite the obvious intelligence and
security failures that contributed to the attack against the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, the reality is that in one
night an al Qaeda-affiliated group destroyed a diplomatic post, killed a U.S. ambassador and three other
Americans, and forced an end to clandestine U.S. activity in the area.
With al Qaeda not dead or on the run but on the rise across the Middle East and South Asia, there is only one
place where the U.S. is on the ground and aggressively fighting back: in Afghanistan, al Qaeda's heartland.
But Americans receive limited news from the front. The latest headlines are dominated by so-called green-on-blue
attacks in which Afghan soldiers or police have attacked their U.S. or allied trainers. These attacks are appalling,
but it is important to understand that the attackers aren't our ""Afghan partners."" They are Taliban foot soldiers and
sympathizers exploiting the very real partnership we have with the growing Afghan National Security Forces. The
attackers represent perhaps 0.01% of the approximately 345,000 Afghan security forces. These terrorists are loud
and bloody, but they are statistically rare.
Americans also hear little about the success of our troops in isolating al Qaeda and the Taliban, cutting them off
from the local population, and helping Afghans stand against them. Or how U.S. troops are restoring security to
areas such as Kandahar that have lived under the thumb of Islamists and warlords for years. Or how sustainable
that security is: This year we dramatically reduced our military presence in Helmand and Kandahar, but residual
allied forces, our Afghan partners and locals have prevented the Taliban from regaining its positions.
The fight is hard and the Afghans aren't easy partners, but we're not in this for the Afghans. We're in this for
ourselves, and for our nation's security.
So why Afghanistan and not Libya, Yemen, Syria or Somalia? Simple. Because we are in Afghanistan, and in
numbers substantial enough to secure and hold territory—denying Ayman al Zawahiri and his followers a
foothold. Afghanistan remains an opportunity to deal al Qaeda a vital strategic blow, especially since we have
abandoned all operations—including counterterrorism operations—in Iraq.
Afghanistan is where much of the al Qaeda journey began. It is the main site where Osama bin Laden, Mullah
Omar and their cohort rose to prominence fighting the Soviets in the 1980s. Afghan territory holds special
significance to the group, which is committed to retaking it and re-establishing it as the base of a global
movement.
Page 36 of 80 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Considering all this still leaves a few reasonable questions, such as why U.S. forces can't leave and have
counterterrorism troops take the lead. The answer is that special-operations forces are among the best and
bravest of our troops, but they aren't magicians. They can't ensure that extremists don't find haven among 35
million Afghans, and they can't stop al Qaeda or the Taliban from preying on Afghan cities and towns.
Without the Afghans helping us in our mission, pretty soon we won't know of anyone to target with drones, and
our special operators will roam through hostile territory unequal to the inflow of terrorists. We need the Afghans'
help in this fight. They are giving a lot—and taking the casualties to prove it. But if we abandon them, they'll stop.
Anyone wondering what Afghanistan will look like if we abandon the war or draw down troops too rapidly should
look to Iraq, where a residual force would almost certainly have halted the current re-emergence of al Qaeda. Or
to Syria, where more moderate forces are being increasingly overrun by hard-line Islamists. Or to Yemen, where
al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has carved out territory and an operational headquarters to plan attacks
against America. Or to Libya, where the facts about Benghazi are still trickling out, but where we know that an al
Qaeda-affiliated group was behind the deadly attack.
The only talking point on Afghanistan that the American people have heard this election season is ""2014""—as in
withdrawal. But al Qaeda and its friends world-wide have heard that too. And it gives them hope that in two short
years their heartland will be ripe for retaking. They know full well—based on U.S. actions from Afghanistan to
Iraq, Iran, Libya and Syria—that U.S. policy is to disengage, and that momentum is on their side",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,75,112,2011,0.861493673,0.744129717,27.3228794,42.1971093

crisis, the Soviet army had 80 14-kiloton nuclear warheads for the FKR cruise missile and 12 two-kiloton nuclear
warheads for the FROG missile, targeted for the U.S. fleet off the Cuban coast and 5,000 Marines in
Guantanamo. These weapons were not discovered with the 60-megaton warheads and ballistic missiles identified
by CIA's U-2 aircraft.
Serving on the USS Thuban as executive officer off the coast of Cuba, I had just returned from a two-year
assignment as a liaison officer with the Soviet army behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany and was aware of
the Soviet mind-set about tactical weapons being useful as battlefield weapons. My concerns stimulated no
interest from those Navy and Marine seniors, who, like all of us, had no information on their presence in Cuba.
President John F. Kennedy never knew of this threat to our forces in a possible landing in Cuba, but he made the

Americans have a sacred obligation to those who fought bravely in Vietnam, and to their families, to rescue their stories from the past.","When we were young men during the Vietnam War, our country's debate over the conflict dominated the national
conversation, overshadowing the stories of courageous, selfless Americans risking their lives on the battlefield.
As generals in the post-9/11 world, we know the wartime climate has changed. Even while citizens often
vigorously debate the use of military force, they still recognize the profound heroism of our men and women in
uniform.
Now, as our nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Vietnam conflict, we must be sure
that generations to come remember the military's sacrifices. Americans have a sacred obligation to those who
fought bravely in Vietnam, and to their families, to rescue their stories from the past.
Vietnam was a divisive period for the nation, and the rough treatment many veterans of that war experienced
thankfully seems foreign today. But many Americans at the time were angry about the war, and some reacted
against returning troops. At airports, universities and elsewhere, protesters screamed insults at veterans or
otherwise targeted those returning from combat.
Such controversy stole attention away from the extraordinary sacrifices made by the millions who served as
volunteers and draftees. Like many of that generation, we were pained to see these men and women forgotten,
particularly those we were close to. One of us was a combat pilot who lost friends over North Vietnam. The other
lost a father in Vietnam.
Thirty years ago, using only private contributions, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund built the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial as a place of healing on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The Wall has since become a
sacred and iconic place for the entire nation. However, as the years continue to pass since the conflict ended, it is
evident that the mission to honor the legacy of Vietnam veterans isn't complete.
As Medal of Honor recipient Brian Thacker noted in 2009, ""The Wall that heals must now become The Wall that
educates."" Using The Wall as a backdrop, we can make yet another profound contribution to this country by
helping future generations understand the sacrifices made by those who have answered the nation's call to duty
in a legacy of service stretching over 200 years.
In 2003, to bring to life the names engraved there, Congress authorized the building of The Education Center at
The Wall. The center will feature an impressive exhibit including photos of Americans lost in Vietnam and select
items from the 400,000 pieces of memorabilia that have been left at The Wall by loved ones, friends and visitors
over the past three decades.
But the Education Center won't be limited to the Vietnam War. It will honor all those who have served America,
going all the way back to 1775. It will offer a special tribute to those who have served in the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq, displaying daily photos of America's fallen from the post-9/11 engagements. The goal is to open the
center's doors in 2014, when most U.S. troops are set to return from Afghanistan.
Thanks to the enormous support of individuals, foundations, corporations and members of the international
community (including the governments of Australia, Singapore and New Zealand), the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Fund has raised more than half of the necessary $85 million for the center. But we can't begin building
until we raise the rest.

What is required after 2014 is assured access to bases when needed, the maintenance of robust intelligence networks, a modest security cooperation effort and a small special operations force for counterterrorism and counter-proliferation response.","Kimberly and Frederick W. Kagan's Nov. 23 commentary, arguing for a force of 30,000 or more Americans in Afghanistan after 2014 [""What we'll need in Afghanistan,"" Sunday Opinion], is fundamentally wrong. Although their goals are sound - preventing terrorist attacks from the region on the United States - the writers' logic and conclusions about the resources required are flawed. It is possible to protect U.S. interests across that region after 2014 with a force in Afghanistan of 10,000 or fewer American troops.

The United States has two vital interests in that part of the world: preventing terrorist attacks on this country and its allies, and preventing nuclear weapons or materials from falling into the hands of terrorists. Protecting these interests after 2014 will require the United States to be able to launch precision military strikes from this region. But it will not require tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.

Scores of news reports describe robust U.S. counterterrorism campaigns across the globe. The United States employs drones, special operations forces and strikes with precision munitions across the Horn of Africa, in Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula, in the Philippines and probably in several other less public places. All of these nations also face some levels of deadly insurgent and terrorist attacks but counter them largely with their own forces, while small teams of Americans focus on counterterrorism and limited advisory missions.

In other words, the United States is already performing the very counterterrorism tasks required in Afghanistan across the globe without committing 15,000, 20,000 or 30,000 troops or the huge logistical and advisory overhead that the Kagans describe as vital. Moreover, in no other U.S. counterterrorism effort are the host-nation security forces the formidable size of the Afghan force - more than 350,000 soldiers and police.

After more than a decade of training and tens of billions of dollars of equipment, these Afghan troops should be fully capable of holding off roughly 30,000 Taliban. Defeating - or at least containing - the Taliban after 2014 is a job for Afghan forces, not Americans.

Although the U.S. surge produced many battlefield gains, it did not bring about any significant improvement in the country's governance or pervasive corruption. These intractable shortcomings are unlikely to be affected by any number of additional U.S. troops before or after 2014.

The Kagans' proposal for an open-ended commitment of more than 30,000 U.S. forces would conservatively cost taxpayers more than $30 billion a year. That would far exceed the combined current U.S. assistance to Israel, Egypt and Pakistan.

Defending our vital interests does not demand a long-term force of this size in Afghanistan, any more than it does today in Yemen, Somalia or Mali. What is required after 2014 is assured access to bases when needed, the maintenance of robust intelligence networks, a modest security cooperation effort and a small special operations force for counterterrorism and counter-proliferation response. Covert programs such as drones will continue to play important, less visible roles. And more robust mobile forces can remain on call outside Afghanistan, should circumstances warrant bigger strike operations of short duration.

Carefully limiting the tasks of U.S. troops inside Afghanistan could permit them to remain poised for missions in support of vital U.S. interests, rather than becoming drawn into securing supply routes, large bases and Afghan territory. A smaller, less conspicuous U.S. force would have the important advantage of being less obtrusive to the Afghan people and thus would be more likely to have the support of the Afghan government.

The Kagans' logic for insisting on a slow drawdown is tenuous at best. The more troops we have in Afghanistan, the more casualties we will sustain. Those sacrifices would be painful but endurable if overall troop levels translated into lasting effects. But there is little evidence that maintaining 68,000 troops in Afghanistan for one or two more years, and 30,000 afterward, would ensure any lasting, measurable effects on the combat- readiness of Afghan forces, Taliban capabilities or terrorist havens in the region. A greater U.S. casualty toll is a high price to pay for such ephemeral effects.

At year 11 of our war in Afghanistan, it's time to consider a smaller enduring U.S. presence as the new endgame. It's also time to craft a steeper ramp to draw down the size of the U.S. presence. This would serve to both shift sizable Afghan forces more rapidly into the fight and to accelerate Afghan political leaders taking ownership of their war against the Taliban. The costs to the United States of supporting an endless ground war in Afghanistan are not merely unwarranted but strategically unwise. It's time to consider all options.

"Reimer, Dennis and Chiarelli, Peter",2012,1,2012-12-09,0,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Allow the Military to Prevent Suicide,"There is a movement now to remove the restriction: The House included an amendment in the 2013 NDAA that would allow these important conversations to occur. But the Senate just passed its version of the NDAA without addressing the issue.

We knew that the troops were our credentials, and we tried to create an environment where they could be the best they could possibly be. This meant getting to know them and their families - whether they lived on or off post. This was part of our responsibility for those under our command. It was - and still is - Leadership 101.

When we lost a service member, for whatever reason, it was a heart-wrenching experience. But it was worse in the case of those who took their own lives. Suicides have been a challenge for the U.S. military for a long time - and the problem is getting more severe. Suicides began rising in the middle of the 2000s, leveled off briefly in 2010 and 2011 and resumed climbing again this year, reaching a record high.

In fact, suicides have become an epidemic. This year, more soldiers, seamen, airmen and Marines died by their own hand than died in battle. Suicide was the No. 1 cause of death for U.S. troops. More than two-thirds of suicides involved firearms, and nearly three-quarters of those cases involved personal weapons, not military weapons.

Reversing this epidemic is among the military's highest priorities. In that regard, one of the things we learned during our careers is that stress, guns and alcohol are a dangerous mixture. In the wrong proportions, they tend to blow out the lamp of the mind and cause irrational acts. Commanders and noncommissioned officers need the tools to prevent this mixture from turning lethal.

One of the most effective measures of suicide prevention is to ask those perceived to be under duress: ""Do you have a gun in your home?"" If the answer is yes, we might then suggest that the individual put locks on the weapon or store it in a safe place during periods of high stress - things that any responsible gun owner should do.

Unfortunately, that potentially lifesaving action is no longer available to the military. A little-noticed provision in the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has had the unintended consequence of tying the hands of commanders and noncommissioned officers by preventing them from being able to talk to service members about their private weapons, even in cases where a leader believes that a service member may be suicidal.

We both strongly believe that this prohibition interferes with every military leader's obligation to ensure the health, welfare, morale and well-being of the troops under his or her command and care.

There is a movement now to remove the restriction: The House included an amendment in the 2013 NDAA that would allow these important conversations to occur. But the Senate just passed its version of the NDAA without addressing the issue. We, along with other retired flag and general officers, senior noncommissioned officers and suicide-prevention advocates, are urging the House and Senate conferees to include language in the final bill that removes this impediment to suicide prevention.

We agree with those members of Congress who have identified military suicides as a national tragedy that Congress, all branches of Defense Department and numerous outside organizations must work together to solve.

We thank them and hope that others will show the same support. We don't doubt the good will of any member of Congress, but in the speed and complexity of congressional action, we fear that this provision in the current NDAA could be forgotten - and the safety of our troops should never be forgotten.

Americans go to great effort and expense to save the lives of our troops in combat situations - furnishing body armor, armored vehicles, night-vision goggles and the best technology and training. It makes no sense to spend billions to save lives in one area but leave lives vulnerable in others - especially when those threats could be reduced with little effort.

Whether the threat comes from enemy fire, friendly fire or by their own hands, we have a moral duty to protect those who serve. When these men and women put themselves under our command and care, they trust us with their lives.

More than occasionally, they arrive seasoned with irony. This is especially true when it comes to war, where battlefield outcomes thought to be conclusive often prove anything but.

Rather than yielding peace, victory frequently serves as a prelude to more war. Once opened, wounds fester. Things begun stubbornly refuse to end. As the renowned strategic analyst F. Scott Fitzgerald once observed, ""The victor belongs to the spoils.""

Next year marks the centennial of the conflict once known as the Great War. Germany lost that war. Whether France and Britain can be said to have won in any meaningful sense is another matter. Besides planting the seeds for an even more horrific bloodletting just two decades later, the fighting of 1914-1918 served chiefly to provide expansion-minded British politicians with a pretext for carving up the Ottoman Empire. It proved a fateful move.

What London wanted from this new Middle East that it nonchalantly cut and pasted was profit and submission; what it got was resentment and resistance, yielding a host of intractable problems that in due time it bequeathed to Washington. In effect, victory in 1918 expanded Britain's imperial domain only to accelerate its demise, with the United States naively assuming the mantle of imperial responsibility (euphemistically termed ""leadership""). Thank you, Perfidious Albion.

Many another storied triumph has contained its own poison pill. More recent examples include the Six Day War, which saddled Israel with a large, restive minority that it can neither pacify nor assimilate; the ouster of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan, giving rise to the Taliban; and Operation Desert Storm, after which the garrisoning of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia helped light the long fuse that would eventually detonate on Sept. 11, 2001.

Think you've won? Wait until all the returns are in.

With the passage of time, near-term military results matter less than long-term political consequences. Fifty years ago, when the Korean War ended in an apparent stalemate, most Americans considered Harry Truman's ""police action"" a horrendous mistake. Viewed today, that brutal conflict may qualify as the most successful U.S. military action of recent decades. Consider what came next: a half-century of stability in Northeast Asia that allowed the Republic of Korea to emerge as a prosperous democracy and a loyal ally. Not too shabby.

Of course, that upbeat assessment pertains only if we define the U.S. objective as containing communism. In the autumn of 1950, the mission of U.S. forces pressing north of the 38th Parallel toward the Yalu River was rollback. Judged by this criterion, Truman's war even today rates as a failure. The effort to liberate North Korea yielded little apart from a needless conflict with China - which prompted a chastened Truman to reinstitute containment as the principal U.S. war aim.

A challenge facing historians of the Iraq war, which began 10 years ago this month, will be to gauge what senior members of George W. Bush's inner circle were actually trying to accomplish. The justifications offered for the invasion were all over the place, including supposed weapons of mass destruction, claims that Saddam Hussein had collaborated with al-Qaeda and visions of democracy throughout the Arab world. Eventually, only this last - Bush's Freedom Agenda - remained. Yet, as the war dragged on, expectations of transforming the Middle East gave way to more modest definitions of success. When it came to advancing the cause of liberty, the Bush administration set out to build a cathedral. In the end, the Obama administration declared itself content with a shaky two-car garage.

Considered from this perspective, Sen. John McCain's recent assertion that ""history has already made a judgment about the surge"" of troops in Iraq in 2007 - a statement meant to disqualify Chuck Hagel as defense secretary for having the gall to question the strategy at the time - qualifies as a nifty sound bite but is suspect on at least two counts. It is almost certainly premature. And more important, it is profoundly misleading.

Anti-government insurgents in Iraq continue to wreak havoc. U.S. forces may have left the scene - the troop surge facilitating their departure - but the conflict continues, its outcome yet undetermined. Granted, bombs blowing up in Baghdad now fall into that vast reservoir of facts that Washington chooses to ignore.

So what did the surge accomplish? With the Bush administration having long since given up on actually winning, the surge - in which 26,000 additional American troops were deployed to Iraq - saved the United States from having to acknowledge outright defeat. Gen. David Petraeus, who commanded the troops during the surge and became its public face, thereby provided an exasperated military with a feel-good moment and gave die-hard proponents of Operation Iraqi Freedom a chance to exchange fist-bumps. That they would savor the moment is perfectly understandable. But the moment was always destined to pass.

Recall when Richard Nixon, back in 1970, turned U.S. forces loose on Cambodia. Enormously controversial at the time, the offensive allowed frustrated troops a chance to get in some licks against an elusive adversary, while back home the Vietnam hawks thumped their chests. Yet any tactical advantage gained by going after North Vietnamese sanctuaries came too late to affect the war's outcome. Ever so briefly, the Cambodian incursion seemed like a really big deal, Nixon himself calling it ""the most successful military operation of the entire war."" That it may have been; but it settled nothing and soon faded to insignificance. I suspect that a similar fate awaits the surge.

The importance attributed to the surge by devotees such as McCain distracts attention from matters of far greater significance. It's the equivalent of using the Battle of New Orleans as a basis for evaluating the War of 1812. Of course, in contrast to Petraeus, Gen. Andrew Jackson defeated his adversary. When the shooting stopped, it was the surviving Redcoats - not the surviving Americans - who packed up and left. Still, take your cues from Johnny Horton, and you might conclude that Jackson single-handedly redeemed an entire war. Take your cues from McCain, and you might conclude that, two centuries later, Petraeus did likewise.

In reality, the heroics at New Orleans proved irrelevant to the outcome of the war, which the Treaty of Ghent had ended two weeks before. The most that can be said for Jackson's victory is that it distracted attention from the egregious failures of political and military leadership that had marked James Madison's War. So, too, for a time Petraeus's victory (if that's what it was) might do the same for George W. Bush's War, likewise marred by glaring errors committed at the top. It's the oldest technique in the campaigner's playbook: Inflate a glimmer of good news to divert attention from all the bad.

With time, context changes, and with it, perspective. With all due respect to the various bicentennial commissions diligently attempting to convince Americans otherwise, the years haveconsigned not only the Battle of New Orleans but the entire War of 1812 to the sphere of things that no longer matter. (Okay, the nation got an anthem, but that's about it.)

The political and military ineptitude displayed during the conflict did nothing to impede what turned out to be one of most momentous stories of the 19th century: the emergence of the United States as the richest and soon the most powerful nation in the world.

Sure, British troops ransacked the White House and burned the Capitol. So what?

I am prepared to speculate - unlike McCain, I make no claim of offering a definitive judgment - that, in its historical importance, the Iraq war will end up somewhere on a par with the War of 1812 (though without a comparable musical legacy). If not forgotten, it will be subsumed into a much larger story, remembered not as a big, important war but as a small, insignificant skirmish. Indeed, that process of diminishment has already commenced, albeit with an unwelcome twist.

In what has become one of the most momentous stories of the 21st century, the inhabitants of the Islamic world are asserting the prerogative of determining their own destinies. Intent on doing things their way, they are increasingly intolerant of foreign interference. In Iraq and Afghanistan, Washington sought to revalidate an altogether different prerogative, one pioneered by Britain: an entitlement to meddle.

To reaffirm that entitlement after Sept. 11, 2001, the United States sought to demonstrate its capacity to impose its will on its designated adversaries. The failure of U.S. forces to do that - to win clearly and unambiguously - calls any further exercise of that entitlement into question. More to the point, it suggests that the big story of Muslim self-determination is likely to continue unimpeded, whether Washington approves or not. Sure, American troops captured Baghdad and overthrew Saddam Hussein. So what?

Back in 1947, the promulgation of the Truman Doctrine kicked off Washington's effort to put its imprint on the Greater Middle East, while affirming that Britain's exit from the region had begun. U.S. power was going to steer events in directions favorable to U.S. interests. That effort now seems likely to have run its course. The United States finds itself today pretty much where the British were back in the 1920s and 1930s. We've bitten off more than we can chew. The only problem is that there's no readily available sucker to whom we can hand off the mess we've managed to create.

"Nagl, John",2008,1,2013-03-20,0,0,0,NYT,Army,,,M,What America Learned in Iraq,It may seem folly to seek a silver lining among these thunderclouds [lessons from Iraq]. But there are three flickers of light that offer some hope that the enormous price was not paid entirely in vain. ,"THE costs of the second Iraq war, which began 10 years ago this week, are staggering: nearly 4,500 Americans killed and more than 30,000 wounded, many grievously; tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis wounded or killed; more than $2 trillion in direct government expenditures; and the significant weakening of the major regional counterweight to Iran and consequent strengthening of that country's position and ambitions. Great powers rarely make national decisions that explode so quickly and completely in their face.

It may seem folly to seek a silver lining among these thunderclouds. But there are three flickers of light that offer some hope that the enormous price was not paid entirely in vain. These coins offer a meager return on our enormous investment, but not collecting them would be an insult to the memory of all that we have lost.

The first lesson is for America's politicians, from both parties, who pushed our country into a war that we did not need to fight for dubious reasons that were eventually proved false.

Iraq was not, as we were repeatedly told, developing weapons of mass destruction; even if it had been, there was no reason deterrence, which prevented war with a nuclear-armed Soviet Union, could not have worked against a nuclear Iraq. There was no link between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, and no Qaeda presence in Iraq until the American invasion, which caused social order to collapse and provided the terrorist group with a powerful recruiting message and a dangerous new base from which to attack.

The invasion of Iraq and its bitter aftermath should remind politicians for generations of the high cost and unpredictable results for those who roll what Otto von Bismarck called ""the iron dice"" and should forever discredit the notion of ""preventive war."" The first Iraq war, in which I led a tank platoon, was necessary; this one was not.

Reluctance to send American ground troops to intervene in Libya and Syria, while providing different levels of political and military support, gives some hope that the country will think more than twice before fighting another unnecessary war. Good intentions do not always lead to favorable outcomes.

The second lesson is for the American military, justly proud of its renaissance after the debacle of Vietnam and subsequent triumph in the cold war but grievously unprepared for the wars of this century.

The British historian Michael Howard noted that it was impossible to perfectly prepare military forces for the next war; what is important is to make sure that you have not gotten the preparations so wrong that the military cannot quickly adapt when it is next needed.

The Department of Defense failed that test. It ignored preparations for counterinsurgency operations and neglected the need for a deep understanding of languages and cultures, which played a critical role in the Sunni Awakening that eventually changed the course of the Iraq conflict.

These are old lessons -- they were in fact codified in the Marine Corps Small Wars Manual of 1940 and had to be painfully relearned over the past decade. They cannot be forgotten now that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are finally drawing down. Recognizing that post-invasion stability operations, including counterinsurgency, are core military tasks for which the Pentagon must prepare is an important first step.

It would also be wise to make further investments in remotely piloted vehicles, Special Operations Forces and the capacity to train and advise foreign militaries, all of which will bear much of the burden of the most likely conflicts of this century. Of course, given the spending constraints now being imposed by Congress and the subsequent painful trade-offs those constraints bring, it remains to be seen whether these lessons have really been learned.

Finally, the experience of the Iraq war offers a breath of hope for the American people at large. In the wake of Vietnam, the United States began its grand experiment of an all-volunteer military. And it was most certainly an experiment: there was no expectation that the system would hold together in a major war, and for two generations young men have been required to register with the Selective Service in case general conflict erupted.

But there have been two such wars over the past decade, and the all-volunteer force has come through these crucibles of blood and fire with enormous distinction.

Tempered by the Great Depression, the Greatest Generation of World War II fame helped defeat fascism on two continents and save civilization. As loudly as their contributions resound in history, two-thirds of them were drafted. This new greatest generation has fought longer if not harder than its grandparents did, and all have been volunteers.

My own tank task force lost 22 fine young men during the second Iraq war, including a West Point captain and five lieutenants, and earned well over 100 Purple Hearts. The nation owes such service members a depth of gratitude it can never fully repay.

But it can begin by ensuring that we care for those who have borne the battle, and for their spouses and their orphans, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, America's greatest wartime president. The traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder that are the signature wounds of these wars are invisible and hard to heal; as many as a fourth of those who fought in Iraq will suffer the ravages of these injuries for decades to come.

This is not a compelling list of gains when balanced against the unbearable losses America has endured in Iraq. But it would devalue the sacrifices of the many who have suffered if we were not to read these lessons written in blood, if our politicians did not approach future interventions with greater humility, if our military did not prepare for all possible wars rather than only the ones that it wants to fight.

We must hope that from such peril and toil this great young generation, tempered by war and hardened by what its members have seen and done, will build a better future for a wiser and chastened America.",5,Warfighting,,,,,,,76,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Cooper, Scott",,1,2013-04-07,0,0,0,WaPO,Marine Corps,,,M,Moral and Strategic,,"I spent a year and a half enforcing ""no-fly"" zones over Iraq and the Balkans. My experiences convinced me that the United States should declare and enforce a no-fly zone over Syria. We would do well to remember the era of no-fly zones and what they did and didn't do.

Those who oppose a no-fly zone cite the risks: Syria has a formidable air-defense network. Policymakers fear the prospect of U.S. pilots being shot down or dragged through the streets of Damascus. Moreover, many contend that a no-fly zone will not solve the conflict. Only by arming the rebels will the tide be turned, they say, and many of those rebels are jihadists with whom we do not want to partner. Critics of a no-fly zone also fear a slippery slope of escalated military involvement that will lead to a quagmire.

These detractors miss the point, which is that a no-fly zone is only part of the solution. Its purpose is not to resolve the conflict but to prevent escalation, protect innocents and provide leverage to negotiations. In essence, a no-fly zone takes away a single tool of violence - the use of aviation - possessed by the oppressor.

Absent the no-fly zones in Bosnia, the Serbs and Croats would have wrought even more destruction than they did. Absent the no-fly zones in Iraq, one can imagine what Saddam Hussein's air force would have done to the minority Kurds and Shiites. The situation in Syria is no different. Bashar al-Assad turned his military on his own citizens, and the tactical advantages his air force possesses are decisive. The goal of the United States and its allies would be to lessen the continued descent into a bloodbath that, over the past two-plus years, has claimed more than 70,000 lives, displaced 3.6 million people inside Syria and forced about 1.3 million to seek refuge outside of Syria.

Americans are understandably chastened by the experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. We witness the chaos of Libya after the use of air power without a subsequent commitment of ground forces, and we are even more reluctant to engage. Many advocate a pragmatic, ""lead from behind"" style, arguing that we must now reason with cold-blooded calculus. Such a view misunderstands our options and our ability to influence the situation in Syria.

The logic of the 1990s was that aggressive enforcement of no-fly zones would aid civilians victimized by these conflicts, prevent escalation and, with the threat of air strikes, end the conflicts more quickly. Those are limited objectives, but they are not insignificant.

Admittedly, air power is no panacea. We witnessed its limits during the Kosovo air campaign of 1999. Slobodan Milosevic called NATO's bluff and didn't back down after the first days of airstrikes. It is important to acknowledge the distinction between the power to deny or destroy and the power to seize or hold forcibly.

A no-fly zone is feasible. Yes, Syria possesses capable air defenses, but they are no match for U.S. air power. I flew missions over Sarajevo; over Pristina, Kosovo; over Nasiriyah and Mosul, Iraq. Not once during any of those air missions did I feel as threatened as I did than when I patrolled the highways of Iraq in a Humvee. We must not lose confidence out of fear by overestimating our opponent's capabilities.

A no-fly zone will not immediately end the conflict, but neutralizing the Syrian air force will erase one of the regime's decisive advantages and lead to a major turning point in the conflict. Doing so is not only morally right but also in our strategic interest. The spillover of violence into Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq is already happening. Moreover, in a post-Assad Syria, the opposition will not forget which nations came to its aid. That was the case in Bosnia and Kosovo, and it has been the case throughout the Muslim world during the recent government upheavals. It was also the case in Iraq, until the occupation spiraled downward into a chaotic insurgency that we initially failed to grasp.

A no-fly zone will provide more options in working with the commander of the Free Syrian Army, Gen. Salim Idriss. With established ""safe zones,"" Syrian rebels could be trained inside Syria. It will open the door for building governance in liberated areas.

A no-fly zone does not address the questions of a major covert-action program and those consequent risks. But it can lessen the slaughter, and it positions the United States on the right side of the conflict, morally and strategically.

They convey fears of shortchanging future generations, overtaxing workers, depriving the needy, killing the fragile economic recovery and failing to make crucial investments.

This narrative contains elements of truth. But it is too pessimistic and contributes to our psychological and political paralysis, reinforcing convictions held by members of both parties that they must not yield on core principles, lest the country's future be compromised. There is, however, a more positive and more accurate reality. The United States could be on the threshold of a period of remarkable progress. It hasa number of unique opportunities, including:

* An energy revolution. We are the world's largest producer of natural gas, with a 100-year supply, and we are on track to become among the largest producers of crude oil.

* A manufacturing revolution. We are rapidly developing robotics and 3-D printing, areas in which the United States is among the world's leaders.

* A revolution in life sciences. Genetics and stem-cell technology offer great potential in fields such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals and fundamentally new approaches in medicine.

* The IT revolution and the transition to cloud computing, in which we are also leading.

With all of these advantages, together with our North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, the energy-rich and economically dynamic Canada and Mexico, we could be on the threshold of the New North American Decades. The prospect is that North America - not China, Japan, Europe or India - will pull the world out of the global economic slowdown. But we will do so only if government gets the basics right.

Huge debt is incompatible with long-term growth. Yet sequestration's arbitrary cuts - particularly to certain defense and domestic programs that provide the foundation and seed for future growth - make it far from optimal as a deficit-cutting action.

Our priority should be to reduce, in a rational manner, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, which is currently around about 75 percent. We need to get the debt curve to begin declining to, say, 72 percent of GDP [[is there value in citing a specific number here? couldn't we say the same thing by saying merely, ""get the debt curve to begin declining""?-sb]] over the next 10 years. The objective should be to steadily reduce the deficit-to-GDP ratio, do this while avoiding measures that would choke off the still-modest recovery. Sequestration-scale cuts done wisely can achieve this goal. The key is to achieve a virtuous cycle in which economic growth yields greater revenue and government spending declines relative to the size of the economy.

How to do this? We suggest that, for the good of the nation, each party agrees to achieve equal amounts of something neither wants to do: Republicans should produce, say, $500 billion in additional revenue over 10 years, and Democrats should identify $500 billion worth of reforms to entitlement programs over the same period.

Sequestration would be repealed. (Reductions in discretionary spending beyond those mandated by the initial provisions of the 2011 Budget Control Act should be sought, although they need be only $100 billion or so, given the substantial cuts already locked in law.)

One simple approach would be for Democrats to propose refinements to the (overly generous) cost-of-living-adjustment formula for Social Security and certain other programs. This has the advantage of being a modest change over time while protecting the basic structure of Social Security. (It appears that President Obama's new budget proposal may move in this direction; if so, that's a positive step.) For their part, Republicans could propose closing tax loopholes to increase revenue, with the proviso that half of any new revenue obtained be dedicated to lowering income tax rates, as economist Martin Feldstein has suggested. In essence, each party gives some, but neither is asked to capitulate on core principles.

The national focus should then shift to addressing issues that would enable the country to capitalize on its extraordinary opportunities:

* Regarding energy, agree on the Keystone XL pipeline while fostering partnerships between extraction companies and environmental groups; determine required regulatory rules; and grant a modest number of licenses to export natural gas.

* On infrastructure, drive the establishment of faster and cheaper Internet connections for most Americans to fully exploit the shift to cloud computing; and repair and rebuild roads, rail lines, ports, electricity grids and other assets that support our economic supply chains.

* On human capital, reform immigration policy; encourage science and technology study and research; and improve public schools while underwriting training in rigorous, relevant vocational skills.

* On finance, reform and simplify the tax code to stimulate savings; make health-care costs more visible; and help bring home the more than $2 trillion sitting offshore.

Not all of this will be achievable at once. But pursued with optimism, rather than lamentation and finger-pointing over our supposed national decline, it may prove more actionable. Given the opportunities before the United States, the future should be remarkable. Let's get on with it.

"Keane, Jack and Pletka, Danielle",2003,1,2013-05-22,0,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,Mixed,How to Stop Assad's Slaughter,"What is keeping Assad in power is his use of fighter planes. If the U.S. wants to break the military stalemate, force Assad into political concessions or aid in his ouster, eliminating his air power should be the first order of business","Syria is not Libya. Bashar Assad's troops are well armed, and his ground forces are waging successful campaigns against rebel forces across the country. But eliminating Assad's ability to take to the air and tilting the balance of power in favor of anti-Assad rebels -- as the United States and its allies did with the fighters who eventually overthrew Moammar Gadhafi -- is both achievable and advisable.

The Syrian air force is capable of aerial bombardment, close air support to ground troops, aerial resupply and delivery of chemical weapons. Assad has used all those capabilities over the past two years to fight the rebels and to kill tens of thousands of civilians. But in the past year, the rebels -- armed with heavy weapons and possibly with shoulder-fired Stinger missiles -- have become more proficient at shooting down helicopters, reportedly as many as 20 so far.

What is keeping Assad in power is his use of fighter planes. If the U.S. wants to break the military stalemate, force Assad into political concessions or aid in his ouster, eliminating his air power should be the first order of business.

The Assad regime's fighter aircraft are also being used to take out civilians in what might be labeled a reverse-counterinsurgency strategy. If counterinsurgency is predicated on the security of the civilian population, then the reverse strategy penalizes civilians and ensures that they are forced to choose between their hope for freedom or the risk of death. Indiscriminately killing civilians is working well for Assad, and the linchpin of his strategy is his regime's air power.

To successfully target Assad's air power, one option is to outfit moderate rebel units vetted by the CIA with man-portable antiaircraft missiles, otherwise known as Manpads. Providing more moderate rebels with Manpads is a reasonable choice, though unlikely to be decisive because time is on Assad's side. There is also a risk that the weapons could be diverted to al Qaeda-related groups. Despite that risk, however, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former CIA Director David Petraeus recommended this strategy last summer.

A cleaner and more decisive option is to strike Syrian aircraft and the regime's key airfields through which Iranian and Russian weapons are flowing to government forces. If American forces use standoff cruise missiles and B-2 stealth bombers for these strikes, they will be out of the enemy's reach.

The airfields are Assad's lifeline of support from Iran and Russia, and without them he's in real trouble. Syria's air force will be severely degraded if the U.S. pursues this option, but Syrian planes won't be entirely grounded because airfields can be repaired. As a result, these operations would need to be sustained for a period of time to preclude repairs.

Then there's the oft-recommended option of establishing a no-fly zone over Syria. It's here where we hear the loudest objections from Syria's allies and others opposed to Western involvement in the conflict. Because the Syrian military is equipped with an array of relatively sophisticated air-defense systems, critics of the no-fly zone strategy suggest that U.S. forces would be in harm's way.

The truth is that these air-defense systems look more impressive on paper than they do in real life. After all, the Israelis have been able to repeatedly penetrate Syrian air space without consequence. The Soviet systems that the regime has are complicated and require intensive maintenance and training. They would be little match for the U.S.

The Russian S300 surface-to-air defense system that news reports indicate is being delivered to Syria would represent a substantial upgrade to Syrian air defense system. Still, the U.S. has the capacity to destroy this system with relative ease using Tomahawk missiles; even small-arms fire would render it almost useless.

Ultimately, the achievability question is straightforward: Taking on Assad's air assets is not an impossibly heavy lift for the U.S., particularly if we are able to enlist support from NATO and the Arab League. Limited operations would render the antiaircraft-system matter moot.

It is the advisability question that is thornier, lending itself to more subjective analysis about the unknowns of a rebel victory and Assad's (as well as Iran's and Hezbollah's) reaction to an escalation. Here are the facts we do know: Right now, countless Syrian innocents are being murdered weekly. Chemical weapons are being used by the regime. Yes, certain factions among the rebels are affiliated with al Qaeda, but it is also true that their allegiance has cost them support among the Syrian civilian population in the months since it was announced.

Play this out: Assad wins and Iran's most important Arab alliance is preserved, with terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad back on the gravy train of international terrorism. American credibility is shot. Or, the conflict continues, and the spillover into Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Iran and Turkey escalates. Is conflict between Israel and Iran over Syria a ridiculous notion? How about the fall of the Jordanian king? More fighting between al Qaeda allies and Hezbollah in Lebanon? The collapse of Iraq? None of our business? Never going to draw us in? Remember, a return to the status quo ante is out of the question.

Arming the right rebels with antiaircraft weapons and severely degrading Assad's air power with limited airstrikes is achievable without boots on the ground and minimal risk to aircrews. If the U.S. pursues this strategy, moderates among the rebels will be strengthened, Syrian civilian casualties are likely to be reduced (though not eliminated) and finally, after two long years, Assad will be on notice. This option leaves room for escalation to the no-fly zone, and for a further escalation to attacks on Assad's ground forces if he uses chemical weapons again or tries to transfer them to America's enemies.

"Eikenberry, Karl and Kennedy, David",2009,1,2013-05-27,0,0,0,NYT,Army,,,M,"Americans and Their Military, Drifting Apart","The civilian-military divide erodes the sense of duty that is critical to the health of our democratic republic, where the most important office is that of citizen. While the armed forces retool for the future, citizens cannot be mere spectators. As Adams said about military power, ""A wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and jealous eye over it.""","AFTER fighting two wars in nearly 12 years, the United States military is at a turning point. So
are the American people. The armed forces must rethink their mission. Though the nation has entered an era of
fiscal constraint, and though President Obama last week effectively declared an end to the ''global war on terror''
that began on Sept. 11, 2001, the military remains determined to increase the gap between its war-fighting
capabilities and those of any potential enemies. But the greatest challenge to our military is not from a foreign
enemy -- it's the widening gap between the American people and their armed forces.
Three developments in recent decades have widened this chasm. First and most basic was the decision in 1973, at
the end of combat operations in Vietnam, to depart from the tradition of the citizen-soldier by ending conscription
and establishing a large, professional, all-volunteer force to maintain the global commitments we have assumed
since World War II. In 1776, Samuel Adams warned of the dangers inherent in such an arrangement: ''A standing
Army, however necessary it may be at some times, is always dangerous to the Liberties of the People. Soldiers are
apt to consider themselves as a Body distinct from the rest of the Citizens.''
For nearly two generations, no American has been obligated to join up, and few do. Less than 0.5 percent of the
population serves in the armed forces, compared with more than 12 percent during World War II. Even fewer of the
privileged and powerful shoulder arms. In 1975, 70 percent of members of Congress had some military service;
today, just 20 percent do, and only a handful of their children are in uniform.
In sharp contrast, so many officers have sons and daughters serving that they speak, with pride and anxiety, about
war as a ''family business.'' Here are the makings of a self-perpetuating military caste, sharply segregated from the
larger society and with its enlisted ranks disproportionately recruited from the disadvantaged. History suggests that
such scenarios don't end well.
Second, technology has helped insulate civilians from the military. World War II consumed nearly half of America's
economic output. But in recent decades, information and navigation technologies have vastly amplified the
individual warrior's firepower, allowing for a much more compact and less costly military. Today's Pentagon budget
accounts for less than 5 percent of gross domestic product and less than 20 percent of the federal budget -- down
from 45 percent of federal expenditures at the height of the Vietnam War. Such reliance on technology can breed
indifference and complacency about the use of force. The advent of remotely piloted aircraft is one logical outcome.
Reliance on drones economizes on both manpower and money, but is fraught with moral and legal complexities, as
Mr. Obama acknowledged last week, in shifting responsibility for the drone program to the military from the C.I.A.
Page 2 of 4
Americans and Their Military, Drifting Apart
Third, and perhaps most troubling, the military's role has expanded far beyond the traditional battlefield. In Iraq and
Afghanistan, commanders orchestrated, alongside their combat missions, ''nation-building'' initiatives like
infrastructure projects and promotion of the rule of law and of women's rights. The potential for conflict in
cyberspace, where military and civilian collaboration is essential, makes a further blurring of missions likely.
Together, these developments present a disturbingly novel spectacle: a maximally powerful force operating with a
minimum of citizen engagement and comprehension. Technology and popular culture have intersected to perverse
effect. While Vietnam brought home the wrenching realities of war via television, today's wars make extensive use
of computers and robots, giving some civilians the decidedly false impression that the grind and horror of combat
are things of the past. The media offer us images of drone pilots, thousands of miles from the fray, coolly and safely
dispatching enemies in their electronic cross hairs. Hollywood depicts superhuman teams of Special Operations
forces snuffing out their adversaries with clinical precision.
The Congressional Research Service has documented 144 military deployments in the 40 years since adoption of
the all-voluntary force in 1973, compared with 19 in the 27-year period of the Selective Service draft following World
War II -- an increase in reliance on military force traceable in no small part to the distance that has come to
separate the civil and military sectors. The modern force presents presidents with a moral hazard, making it easier
for them to resort to arms with little concern for the economic consequences or political accountability. Meanwhile,
Americans are happy to thank the volunteer soldiers who make it possible for them not to serve, and deem it is
somehow unpatriotic to call their armed forces to task when things go awry.
THE all-volunteer force may be the most lethal and professional force in history, but it makes a mockery of George
Washington's maxim: ''When we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen.'' Somehow, soldier and
citizen must once again be brought to stand side by side.
Let's start with a draft lottery. Americans neither need nor want a vast conscript force, but a lottery that populated
part of the ranks with draftees would reintroduce the notion of service as civic obligation. The lottery could be
activated when volunteer recruitments fell short, and weighted to select the best-educated and most highly skilled
Americans, providing an incentive for the most privileged among us to pay greater heed to military matters. The
Pentagon could also restore the so-called Total Force Doctrine, which shaped the early years of the all-volunteer
force but was later dismantled. It called for a large-scale call-up of the Reserves and National Guard at the start of
any large, long deployment. Because these standby forces tend to contain older men and women, rooted in their
communities, their mobilization would serve as a brake on going to war because it would disrupt their communities
(as even the belated and smaller-scale call-up of some units for Iraq and Afghanistan did) in ways that sending only
the standing Army does not.
Congress must also take on a larger role in war-making. Its last formal declarations of war were during World War
II. It's high time to revisit the recommendation, made in 2008 by the bipartisan National War Powers Commission, to
replace the 1973 War Powers Act, which requires notification of Congress after the president orders military action,
with a mandate that the president consult with Congress before resorting to force. This would circumscribe
presidential power, but it would confer greater legitimacy on military interventions and better shield the president
from getting all the blame when the going got tough.
Congress should also insist that wars be paid for in real time. Levying special taxes, rather than borrowing, to
finance ''special appropriations'' would compel the body politic to bear the fiscal burden -- and encourage citizens to
consider war-making a political choice they were involved in, not a fait accompli they must accept.
Other measures to strengthen citizen engagement with the military should include decreased reliance on
contractors for noncombat tasks, so that the true size of the force would be more transparent; integrating veteran
and civilian hospitals and rehabilitation facilities, which would let civilians see war's wounded firsthand; and
shrinking self-contained residential neighborhoods on domestic military bases, so that more service members could
pray, play and educate their children alongside their fellow Americans. Schools, the media and organs of popular
culture also have a duty to help promote civic vigilance.

"McChrystal, Stanley ",2010,1,2013-05-29,0,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Lincoln's Call to Service - and Ours,"Universal national service would surely face obstacles. But America is too big, and our challenges too expansive, for small ideas. To help stem the high-school dropout crisis, to conserve rivers and parks, to prepare for and respond to disasters, to fight poverty and, perhaps most important, to instill in all Americans a sense of civic duty, the nation needs all its young people to serve.","My father first took me to Gettysburg when I was 12 years old. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Army, home
from the first of two tours in Vietnam. I remember in particular the hundreds of obelisks poking over the berms,
the oxidized plaques attached to rocks and the statues lining the roadways. All spoke for the thousands of men
and boys who had died in the grass and dirt serving their nation.
I was young, but I recognized the gravity of the place.
Though I went on to have a career in the military, the visits to Gettysburg with my father were not preparation for
soldiering as much as they were early lessons in citizenship—a particular understanding of citizenship that
President Lincoln defined and challenged us to fulfill when he delivered his famous address there. It's a
citizenship that does not simply reflect upon the sacrifices of others, but that honors their sacrifice through action:
""It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so
nobly advanced.""
Today, as ever, the task is unfinished. Yet the duties of citizenship have fallen from the national agenda. Talk of
service is largely confined to buoyant commencement ceremonies. And too often it is just that: talk.
Less than 1% of Americans serve in the military—a historic low during wartime—leading to a broad, complacent
assumption that serving the nation is someone else's job. As we've allowed our understanding of service to be so
narrowly limited to the uniform, we've forgotten Lincoln's audience: With the armies still fighting, the president
exhorted a crowd of civilians on their duty to carry forward the nation's work.
It is right that we send off the young Americans graduating this month from high school, college and professional
schools with speeches. They should be congratulated for completing the many exams now behind them. But we
must remember another test—Lincoln's test of citizenship—and begin to mark these important junctures in life not
just with words, but with real-world commitment.
Universal national service should become a new American rite of passage. Here is a specific, realistic proposal
that would create one million full-time civilian national-service positions for Americans ages 18-28 that would
complement the active-duty military—and would change the current cultural expectation that service is only the
duty of those in uniform.
At age 18, every young man and woman would receive information on various options for national service. Along
with the five branches of the military, graduates would learn about new civilian service branches organized
around urgent issues like education, health care and poverty. The positions within these branches would be
offered through AmeriCorps as well as through certified nonprofits. Service would last at least a year.
Returning military veterans would be treated as the civic assets they are and permitted to use a portion of their GI
Bill benefits to support a period of civilian national service, since such service helps them transition to life back
home.
The new service opportunities would be created in accordance with the smart rules that have guided AmeriCorps
since its founding in 1994, which allow that program to field tens of thousands of service members without
displacing workers and who fill vital niches their paid colleagues do not.
Page 48 of 80 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Serving full-time for a year or two needs to be a realistic option for all young Americans, regardless of their
family's finances. So civilian service positions would be modestly paid, as AmeriCorps positions are now. (Most
AmeriCorps service-members receive a $12,100 stipend for the year, and if they complete their term of service, a
$5,550 scholarship to help cover tuition or to pay off student loans.) Government agencies focused on the
challenges that these service-members address, as well as the corporations that will benefit from employing
Americans whose leadership will be cultivated by service, should step up to fund these efforts.
Instead of making national service legally mandatory, corporations and universities, among other institutions,
could be enlisted to make national service socially obligatory. Schools can adjust their acceptance policies and
employers their hiring practices to benefit those who have served—and effectively penalize those who do not.
More than most Americans realize, the demand to serve already exists. In 2011, there were nearly 600,000
applications to AmeriCorps—a program with only 80,000 positions, only half of which are full time. The Peace
Corps received 150,000 requests for applications but has funding for only 4,000 new positions each year. This
gap represents democratic energy wasted and a generation of patriotism needlessly squandered.
Some, particularly after having just observed Memorial Day, might think that only war is capable of binding a
generation and instilling true civic pride. But you don't have to hear the hiss of bullets to develop a deeper claim to
the nation. In my nearly four decades in the military, I saw young men and women learn the meaning and
responsibilities of citizenship by wearing the uniform in times of both peace and war. They were required to work
with people of different backgrounds, introduced to teamwork and discipline, unified by common tests, and
brought even closer by sacrifice. Some discovered, often to their surprise, that they were leaders.
This transformation is not exclusive to the military. Those who disagree need only visit young teachers working
18-hour days together in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans. In rural Colorado health clinics, in California's forests, or
Midwest neighborhoods devastated by tornadoes, skeptics would see teams of young people—affluent and poor,
college-educated and not—devoting their days to a singular, impactful mission.
Universal national service would surely face obstacles. But America is too big, and our challenges too expansive,
for small ideas. To help stem the high-school dropout crisis, to conserve rivers and parks, to prepare for and
respond to disasters, to fight poverty and, perhaps most important, to instill in all Americans a sense of civic duty,

These could, and hopefully will, emerge from the Obama-Xi meetings. As the two greatest powers on Earth are already deeply entangled economically and developing their militaries against each other, there is no time to waste.","President Obama's talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping should mark the United States' true ""pivot"" to Asia -
and it can't come soon enough. China is more powerful than many Americans realize, and it is on a trajectory to
become even more capable. At the same time, the Chinese may underestimate or misread us. Absent deeper
understandings and greater cooperation, that's a potentially dangerous combination.
I first went to China in 1983, on one of the first official U.S. military visits. In those days, China sought to use the
United States as a counterbalance to the threat from the Soviet Union. Traveling to China regularly over the past
decade for banking business, I have met top officials and visited enterprises. Unfailingly, I have been welcomed,
treated with respect and listened to.
China is a rising power, surging forward economically year after year. Its $8 trillion economy is second only to the
United States' (almost $16 trillion) - but in terms of purchasing power, the two are much closer, and China is
growing almost three times faster. Its leaders seem to think their country will soon overtake the United States.
They look at U.S. unemployment, slow growth and indebtedness and see a declining economic superpower. The
Chinese want their due, and they are growing impatient.
In Xi, who is both president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, the Chinese have a leader who
seems comfortable handling the country's political and economic development as well as its rapidly growing
military capabilities. Those include stealth and drone technology; global positioning, anti-missile and anti-satellite
capabilities; nuclear missiles; a growing naval capability aimed at the United States; and power-projection forces
challenging its Asian neighbors.
It is clear from top-level Chinese diplomatic visits to India and Pakistan this spring and China's challenges in the
South China Sea and near Japan that this generation of leaders will be more assertive. We should listen when
they ask why the United States is trying to ""contain"" China or sends its airplanes to ""provoke"" Chinese radar. We
should take note, too, when Chinese citizens ask why we ""like"" the Vietnamese and Japanese more than them. In
a communist state where the media are controlled, opinions usually start at the top. These are the rumblings that
presage a significant challenge.
China's leaders have a strategy, and they are moving vigorously: procuring natural resources abroad, gathering
technology, developing infrastructure, managing urban growth and employment, building a university system and
shifting development into China's interior. Eventually, China will produce more for its markets, protect intellectual
property and raise the value of its currency. It will encourage use of the renminbi as a global currency. Its leaders
expect to resume China's historic place at the center of world wealth, culture, technology and power. And,
naturally, they are also asserting Chinese sovereignty, using historical claims, the residual antipathies of war and
cultural sympathies to push outward - and gain relief from what they see as a too-confining U.S. presence.
As one well-connected Chinese businessman told me: ""The Vietnamese are arrogant; they are using you. We will
teach them a lesson, and if you get in the way, you will be hurt."" He went on to say that China could blind our
GPS and see our stealth aircraft. Was it an idle boast? An indirect ""official"" warning? A leak from some
political-military planning scenario? We need to understand.

Meanwhile, top Chinese officials don't seem to understand the United States. They don't travel here for leisure or
business. And despite their much-discussed cyber-penetration of U.S. business, academia and government,
official China listens through its own experiences and culture. Its leaders don't hear from our leaders about
sweeping strategic visions, such as their own much-publicized five-year plans; to them, U.S. political debate looks
like weakness and the free-market system lacks strategic direction, with individual businesses doing almost
anything to advance quarterly earnings. They don't understand why our young people aren't more motivated
educationally. And in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, they underestimate the vast economic potential of the
United States - the resources, people and incredible energy that an aroused America can bring to any challenge,
particularly to our global leadership.
Such misunderstandings not only hinder cooperation but also raise risks in any time of challenge. It is vital that
the Obama-Xi talks include discussion of these differing perspectives and take personal measure of the other's
character, style and resolve. These talks also provide an opportunity to recognize common interests, such as
asymmetrical trade, investments and exchanges. But areas of disagreement - the Middle East, North Korea,
Africa - must also be discussed and markers put in place on issues such as freedom of the seas around China,
cybersecurity, trade, investment, corruption and human rights. No concrete results should be anticipated, or
sought, yet.
But a schedule should be crafted for frequent meetings, at various levels, on military, environmental, commerce,
technology, education and culture issues - and we should seek results. Treaties and written agreements matter
less to the Chinese than do broad strategies and general understandings. Nevertheless, we must work to bring
them toward the global architecture that the West has constructed in the course of more than half a century.
Wherever possible, we should agree and publish confidence-building measures. These will be important in
deepening dialogue, promoting mutual understanding and shaping how China deals with the outer world.
There is no better means to resolve the myriad headline issues of the moment than longer-term strategic

"Clark, Wesley",2000,1,2013-06-19,0,0,0,NYT,Army,,,M,"To Get a Syrian Truce, Be Ready to Escalate","The conflict, and the diplomacy needed to end it, are likely to play out simultaneously. All parties will be recalculating their options and risks, so any assurance Mr. Obama gives Americans that he will limit our engagement would reduce the chances of success. This is a nerve-racking time, but the consequences of inaction are too high. Working together, America, Russia and China can halt Syria's agony and the slide toward wider conflict. Mr. Obama's decision might be the catalyst to get that done.","FOLLOWING the Obama administration's conclusion last week that President Bashar al-Assad's forces have used chemical weapons, the talk in Washington is all about military assistance to Syria's rebels. That aid is necessary, but observers have overlooked a crucial point: the American decision to give rebels lethal aid, though it might eventually contribute to the overthrow of Mr. Assad, opens an opportunity for concerted diplomacy to end the bloodshed.

President Obama's decision to supply small arms and ammunition to the rebels is a step, possibly just the first, toward direct American intervention. It raises risks for all parties, and especially for Mr. Assad, who knows that he cannot prevail, even with Russian and Iranian military aid, if the United States becomes fully engaged. We used a similar strategy against the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo in 1999, where I commanded American forces, and showed that NATO had the resolve to escalate. With a brutal dictator like Mr. Assad, only the knowledge that he cannot prevail will force him to negotiate an exit.

Mr. Obama has sought a diplomatic solution for some time, but has been reluctant to take steps that might lead to military intervention. Rightly so. No one wants more death and disruption in the Middle East, nor another open-ended military commitment -- and certainly not the Pentagon. Despite the humanitarian tragedy in Syria, most of the conditions that have allowed previous interventions to succeed are absent. Legal authorization from the United Nations is unlikely, given opposition from Russia and China. Syria's rebels are fragmented politically and militarily; some are religious extremists with professed ties to Al Qaeda.

What would follow Mr. Assad's departure is unclear, which is why he has managed to retain support from Shiites and other minorities, besides his own Alawite sect, who fear the consequences of a Sunni-led takeover. Iranian agents, along with their allies from Hezbollah, are involved, as are the Russians, who have a naval port at Tartus.

But inaction is not an option. The bloodletting -- more than 90,000 are estimated to have died so far -- has deepened the region's longstanding Shiite-Sunni struggle. It has become a proxy war, with Sunni Arab states backed by the West, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, challenging Iran's reach to the Mediterranean via a proxy, Hezbollah, and Syria.

The risk of going beyond lethal aid to establishing a no-fly zone to keep Mr. Assad's planes grounded or safe zones to protect refugees -- options under consideration in Washington -- is that we would find it hard to pull back if our side began losing. Given the rebels' major recent setbacks, can we rule out using air power or sending in ground troops?

Yet the sum total of risks -- higher oil prices, a widening war -- also provide Syria (and its patrons, Iran and Russia) a motive to negotiate. If Mr. Obama can convince Iran that he is serious, and is ready to back up his new promise of aid with additional forces, Iran and Russia will know the risks: Mr. Assad could lose his regime, and most likely his life. Higher oil prices would cost China, which has blocked anti-Syrian initiatives at the United Nations, dearly.

In 1999 in Kosovo, the West used force as leverage for diplomacy. There, a limited NATO air campaign began after diplomatic talks failed to halt Serbian ethnic cleansing. The bombing lasted 72 days, and plans for a ground invasion of Serbia were under way when Mr. Milosevic finally bowed to the inevitable.

Of course, the Middle East is not the Balkans, the Russian government is more confident now than it was then, and Americans are tired after a decade of war. But there are similarities: The Kosovars, too, bickered among themselves, and some were said to be terrorists. The Russians backed Serbia -- and at one point suggested that their naval fleet in the Black Sea would intervene. Like Mr. Assad, Mr. Milosevic was rational and calculating -- he, too, wanted to survive.

Mr. Assad knows that Mr. Obama can be surprisingly resolute, as in his approval of drone strikes and the military operation to kill Osama bin Laden. While the United States begins to supply the rebels, there is a crucial opening for talks. Russia or China could recalculate and help lead Syria to a real peace process, as Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, a former Russian prime minister, did in Kosovo in 1999. Iran could emerge from a truce with Hezbollah's power in Lebanon (and its strong links to Iran) intact.

The formula for diplomacy is clear: a cease-fire agreement; a United Nations presence; departure of foreign fighters; disarmament of Syrian fighters; international supervision of Syria's military; a peaceful exit for Mr. Assad, his family and key supporters; a transitional government; and plans for a new Syria.

The conflict, and the diplomacy needed to end it, are likely to play out simultaneously. All parties will be recalculating their options and risks, so any assurance Mr. Obama gives Americans that he will limit our engagement would reduce the chances of success.

"Deptula, David",2010,1,2013-06-23,0,0,0,WSJ,Air Force,,,M,America's No Fly Zones Are Already in Place,"Plenty of opinions will be offered, but America's leaders would do well to seek guidance from the document describing the reason for the government's existence -- the Preamble to the Constitution. The Founders wrote that the nation was constituted to ""provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.""","There has been much talk lately in Washington about establishing a no-fly zone in Syria. You don't hear about the no-fly zones that are already up and running -- over the United States. Where in the U.S.? Over places like Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, the Air Force's premier combat training range; and over Naval Air Stations Oceana in Virginia and China Lake in California, affecting Navy and Marine Corps aviation. Then there are the no-fly zones over Seymour Johnson AFB Goldsboro, N.C., the home of an F-15E fighter wing; Hill AFB in Ogden, Utah, home to F-16 fighters; and Ellsworth AFB, S.D., the home of B-1 bombers that provide America global reach and power.

Those and others are no-fly zones because Congress has legislated, through budget sequestration, the shutdown of major air capabilities of the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Military spending is scheduled to be cut by $492 billion over 10 years, with $52 billion in mandatory, across-the-board reductions coming next year.

But the $42 billion axed from the military in 2013 is already damaging America's combat readiness -- and therefore its security. Our military readiness is plummeting, especially the nation's air power, which underpins the entire military's ability to operate when and where necessary. In the Air Force alone, more than 30 squadrons are now grounded, along with aircrews, and maintenance and training personnel. The U.S. military's foremost air-combat training exercise -- Red Flag -- has been canceled for the rest of the year. The graduate schools for Air Force, Navy and Marine combat aviators have been canceled. Equipment testing and upgrades to F-22s, F-15s, F-16s and other aircraft have been delayed.

Without testing, improvements can't be made, and without upgrades air forces atrophy and their capability declines. Training, testing and education are vital to keeping forces honed to a combat edge. The excellence and high standard of those activities have enabled the U.S. to remain the world's sole superpower.

Flying and maintaining proficiency in high-performance military aircraft is not like riding a bike. It requires constant preparation and training to maintain the superior combat capabilities that have long been the pride of the U.S. As foreign military equipment and technology around the world approached America's own weapons capabilities, superior air-combat training gave the U.S. an advantage. With large numbers of U.S. airmen around the world not flying, that is no longer the case.

The real danger is that the damage caused by the no-fly zones imposed by sequestration will not be recognized until too late -- until air forces and personnel are required to support America's vital security interests in times and places unforeseen and impossible to predict.

The U.S. Air Force has always focused on being 100% ready at all times. That's the goal. Why? Because being in a posture to deploy and employ quickly creates capabilities to engage around the world to encourage peace and stability. If necessary, that posture provides the foundation for success in war-fighting. Sequestration's no-fly zones result in a disproportionate loss of national capability because they hinder the Air Force's role as America's ""first response force."" This quickness buys the Navy and Army time to spin up and steam to the fight.

The hollow force caused by sequestration means that the U.S. has a growing strategy-resource mismatch: a widening gap between what our leaders say and what the nation can accomplish. Sequestration was designed to be so irresponsible that Congress would prevent its implementation. Now that it has been implemented, the danger is that Washington begins to think the military cuts are tolerable.

With the consequences of the cuts not immediately apparent, Congress might regard them as a more palatable way to cut military spending than the politically unpopular Base Realignment and Closure Act. Earlier this month, the House of Representative approved legislation to prohibit another round of BRAC, even though it could be used to cut the military's excess infrastructure and achieve significant savings. The ban appears likely to become law. Combat readiness doesn't have a constituency -- except for the entire nation, when fighting needs to be accomplished.

Ultimately, the staggering challenge of the national debt will have to be addressed in a more responsible way than by a sequester. When that time comes, a discussion of first principles is essential. Who is to determine what is the appropriate ""fair share"" of each of the elements of government? How do we determine priorities?

Plenty of opinions will be offered, but America's leaders would do well to seek guidance from the document describing the reason for the government's existence -- the Preamble to the Constitution. The Founders wrote that the nation was constituted to ""provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.""

Providing for the common defense is U.S. government job one. On the ample evidence of the past year -- the deficit debates, the potential solutions offered to resolve the fiscal crisis, the damage done to America's security by sequestration -- too many people in leadership positions have forgotten that obligation.",9,BdgtWpnsTrps,1,,,,,The author is arguing that the Congress look at the Constitution and what it already says. ,76,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444

Deploying more small ships is appealing, but to get to areas of interest such as the Middle East, the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean we must cross vast waters and remain present for extended periods. Size, speed, endurance and lethality matter greatly, especially when forward bases can't be assured at a time when foreign populations are prickly about sovereignty.","The American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) characterized naval power as ""more silent than the
clash of arms."" His emphasis on the centrality of this ""silent"" power in world affairs captured the interest of a
young visiting lecturer at the Naval War College in the late 1880s. That lecturer, Theodore Roosevelt, would go
on to be president and transform the U.S. Navy into the global force that has underpinned international security
and prosperity for a century.
The sort of thinking about naval power that informed Mahan's and Roosevelt's work now appears anachronistic.
When the U.S. Navy is discussed today, the conversation leaps immediately over strategy to commentary on
budgets and the number of ships. Those are aspects of sea power, to be sure, but the ability to command the
seas is much more than comparisons with other navies and much more complexly tied to our place in the world.
Sea power sets conditions for stable world trade, as some 90% of commerce moves on the oceans. The Navy's
persistent presence far from our shores enables effective diplomacy and provides regional influence without the
burdens and sensitivity of deploying ground troops on foreign lands.
In ""Mayday: The Decline of American Naval Supremacy,"" Seth Cropsey, a former deputy undersecretary of the
Navy, argues that the end of unchallenged U.S. supremacy at sea may be closer than American policy makers
would like to think. In a well-structured narrative, Mr. Cropsey provides a concise and compelling summary of the
evolution of American and other great powers' application of and dependence on sea power. He chronicles the
waxing and waning of that power and the global order that has come with our nation's ability to command the
seas.
Navies aren't just a whimsical investment of national treasure. Rather, they are an outgrowth of trade and man's
desire to extract resources from the sea, be they fish or natural gas. The relationship of commercial success and
naval might is evident in the rise of great powers throughout history—Spain in the 16th century, Holland in the
17th, France in 18th and Great Britain in the 19th. It is likely that today Mahan finds a more devout audience
among China's strategic thinkers than our own. Chinese naval deployments to areas important economically,
such as the Southeast Asian sea lanes and the pirate-plagued trade routes in the vicinity of Africa, reinforce
Chinese diplomatic and commercial activities. With Beijing so dependent on faraway markets and imports of
natural resources, naval power weighs heavily in all its considerations.
China, Mr. Cropsey argues, is on the path to overtake U.S. naval power, with little deliberation in this country
about the consequences of such a development. As Mr. Cropsey warns, reducing the number of U.S. ships
""accelerates the decline of American sea power, unintentionally adding strategic weight to Beijing's naval buildup,
and more important, to China's rise to dominance in Asia. Politicians have not faced this basic question of
strategy.""
The last transfer of sea power was between nations, Great Britain and the U.S., that shared political values and
commercial philosophies and saw eye-to-eye on freedom of navigation in international waters. It was a seamless
transition for the international order at the time. What will be the effect among our allies and like-minded partners
should U.S. sea power wane, our global naval presence diminish and China replace the U.S. as the guarantor of
international commerce and maritime security? As Mr. Cropsey says, ""the signs point to a change in power in the
western Pacific,"" a region of great importance to our future prosperity.
With its 286 ships, the U.S. Navy is now smaller than it was in 1917, when it boasted 342. The number is stuck,
and the trend spans the administrations of both parties. We have spent heavily on our wars in Iraq and

Afghanistan, and the U.S. Navy, which is central to our long-term strategic interests, languishes. Navies, unlike
armies, take time to build—why the framers of our Constitution wrote of the imperative to ""provide and maintain a
Navy,"" as opposed to the need to ""raise and support an Army.""
""Mayday"" provides an insider's view into the many ills of the Navy's planning and budgeting system. These range
from low and unsteady quantities of ship orders; to the trade-offs between building a few cutting-edge ships and
more ships less technologically complex; to the ever increasing ""contractual, statutory and regulatory"" burdens on
the Navy. The latter include a requirement for new paints that emit fewer toxins in shipbuilding; compliance adds
an estimated $16 million to the price of an aircraft carrier. But ""Mayday"" doesn't address forcefully enough how
diminishing procurement budgets will be further eroded by rapidly rising personnel costs and inefficiencies within
the procurement process itself.
Mr. Cropsey offers some good recommendations to adjust the size and makeup of the Navy. He wisely advocates
that ""the most advanced technology should bow to numbers"" and argues for pursuing unmanned systems to
achieve ""decreased cost and increased surveillance and combat power."" Yet some of his suggestions fall short, in
that they assume a linear relationship between cost and reduced ship size. The inconvenient truth is that a ship
that is half the size doesn't cost half as much. Deploying more small ships is appealing, but to get to areas of
interest such as the Middle East, the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean we must cross vast waters and
remain present for extended periods. Size, speed, endurance and lethality matter greatly, especially when
forward bases can't be assured at a time when foreign populations are prickly about sovereignty.
But ""Mayday"" is extremely timely, reminding us that security and prosperity are inextricably linked to sea power.

Washington, just do it. ",Washington does not need to be the only answer. It just needs to avoid being the main problem -- and then live to fight another budget battle as the parties seek new mandates from the voters in 2014 and 2016. That is how it is supposed to work. That is why Congress and the president should seek a compromise deal now.,"As Congress heads home for its August recess, huge political storms are brewing over a budget impasse that will confront lawmakers when they return. The House is basing its annual spending bills on one set of relatively draconian budgetary assumptions, the Senate on a whole different set. And hanging over everything is the need for another extension of the debt ceiling to keep the government running.

In fairness to Democrats and Republicans, the paralysis is largely based on principle, not parochialism or pettiness. Democrats typically want to protect entitlements and other assistance for middle-income Americans, who have suffered significantly in recent years.

Republicans tend to worry that the burgeoning growth in entitlements, especially Social Security and Medicare, must be checked -- and soon. While they agree that the middle class is beleaguered, Republicans view tax relief as a better response than government programs.

As is often the case, there is merit on both sides, and the difference in perspective on important issues is a compelling reason for why a two-party system makes for a strong democracy.

But Washington is still making a fundamental error, no doubt one that constituents will point out when members return home. Important elements in each party treat compromise as if it were a dirty word.

The very notion of a ""Tea Party"" suggests a moral clarity in the struggle to fight off oppression and promote liberty. By this perspective, the nation's deficit and debt are the direct result of a runaway government behemoth that must be directly confronted.

By contrast, for staunch defenders of federal entitlements, any possible restraint on the rate of growth of some programs is treated like a direct assault on the poor and working classes. Many in this debate abhor the notion of meeting the other side halfway.

In some realms of public policy, compromise is wrongheaded or impossible. Causes such as the abolition of slavery and the attainment of full rights for women are historical examples where there was a right answer, but it was not the politically convenient midpoint between the two most popular positions of the day.

Stark choices in war

Military conflict is generally another case in point. You either go to war or you don't, and trying to fudge the distinction is usually a mistake. Even within wars, some decisions can't be blurred.

For example, as we saw in Iraq, once President Bush decided to surge forces in 2007, it was important that the nation do so resolutely. We needed to make a decision and then properly resource it -- or accept that we were likely headed for defeat.

But the federal budget debate is different. The battles are ongoing and never-ending, and the results are seldom permanent. The system is set up to allow debate and adjustment on an annual basis. It is also set up to require compromise when we have divided government.

Choices more palatable

If we had extremely high tax and spending burdens like some European countries, Tea Partiers might be right that it was time for a showdown about the country's future. Or, if entitlements were about to be savaged by a heartless right wing, Democrats might be right to defend them at all costs.

In fact, our budget choices today are much more palatable. Tax rates are lower than they were under President Clinton, and virtually no one wants to raise them massively. Entitlements have just been expanded under a Republican president and continue to grow faster than inflation, and virtually no one is proposing that we actually cut them. So we have space within which to compromise.

Finally, Washington should not exaggerate government's role in our economic future. Beyond the Beltway, the gradual recovery of the housing market, the reinvigoration of domestic energy production and U.S. manufacturing, exciting progress in new technologies such as cyber and 3-D printing, and the ongoing electronics revolution are beginning to bring our economy back -- and our deficit down.

Washington does not need to be the only answer. It just needs to avoid being the main problem -- and then live to fight another budget battle as the parties seek new mandates from the voters in 2014 and 2016. That is how it is supposed to work.

They will do it with all the professionalism and skill we expect from the world's most proficient military. I wish Kerry would take a moment to look at the images from this week's hearings before we go to war again.","Military planners privately say that Obama's plan for Syria is an outrage.

The tapes tell the tale. Go back and look at images of our nation's most senior soldier, Gen. Martin Dempsey, and his body language during Tuesday's Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Syria. It's pretty obvious that Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, doesn't want this war. As Secretary of State John Kerry's thundering voice and arm-waving redounded in rage againstBashar al-Assad's atrocities, Dempsey was largely (and respectfully) silent.

Dempsey's unspoken words reflect the opinions of most serving military leaders. By no means do I profess to speak on behalf of all of our men and women in uniform. But I can justifiably share the sentiments of those inside the Pentagon and elsewhere who write the plans and develop strategies for fighting our wars. After personal exchanges with dozens of active and retired soldiers in recent days, I feel confident that what follows represents the overwhelming opinion of serving professionals who have been intimate witnesses to the unfolding events that will lead the United States into its next war.

They are embarrassed to be associated with the amateurism of the Obama administration's attempts to craft a plan that makes strategic sense. None of the White House staff has any experience in war or understands it. So far, at least, this path to war violates every principle of war, including the element of surprise, achieving mass and having a clearly defined and obtainable objective.

They are repelled by the hypocrisy of a media blitz that warns against the return of Hitlerism but privately acknowledges that the motive for risking American lives is our ""responsibility to protect"" the world's innocents. Prospective U.S. action in Syria is not about threats to American security. The U.S. military's civilian masters privately are proud that they are motivated by guilt over slaughters in Rwanda, Sudan and Kosovo and not by any systemic threat to our country.

They are outraged by the fact that what may happen is an act of war and a willingness to risk American lives to make up for a slip of the tongue about ""red lines."" These acts would be for retribution and to restore the reputation of a president. Our serving professionals make the point that killing more Syrians won't deter Iranian resolve to confront us. The Iranians have already gotten the message.

Our people lament our loneliness. Our senior soldiers take pride in their past commitments to fight alongside allies and within coalitions that shared our strategic goals. This war, however, will be ours alone.

They are tired of wannabe soldiers who remain enamored of the lure of bloodless machine warfare. ""Look,"" one told me, ""if you want to end this decisively, send in the troops and let them defeat the Syrian army. If the nation doesn't think Syria is worth serious commitment, then leave them alone."" But they also warn that Syria is not Libya or Serbia. Perhaps the United States has become too used to fighting third-rate armies. As the Israelis learned in 1973, the Syrians are tough and mean-spirited killers with nothing to lose.

Our military members understand and take seriously their oath to defend the constitutional authority of their civilian masters. They understand that the United States is the only liberal democracy that has never been ruled by its military. But today's soldiers know war and resent civilian policymakers who want the military to fight a war that neither they nor their loved ones will experience firsthand.

Civilian control of the armed services doesn't mean that civilians shouldn't listen to those who have seen war. Our most respected soldier president, Dwight Eisenhower, possessed the gravitas and courage to say no to war eight times during his presidency. He ended the Korean War and refused to aid the French in Indochina; he said no to his former wartime friends Britain and France when they demanded U.S. participation in the capture of the Suez Canal. And he resisted liberal democrats who wanted to aid the newly formed nation of South Vietnam. We all know what happened after his successor ignored Eisenhower's advice. My generation got to go to war.

Over the past few days, the opinions of officers confiding in me have changed to some degree. Resignation seems to be creeping into their sense of outrage. One officer told me: ""To hell with them. If this guy wants this war, then let him have it. Looks like no one will get hurt anyway.""

Soon the military will salute respectfully and loose the hell of hundreds of cruise missiles in an effort that will, inevitably, kill a few of those we wish to protect.

Civilian leaders, with advice from the military, decide when to engage.

The Sept. 6 commentary by retired Maj. Gen. Robert H. Scales [""A war the Pentagon doesn't want,"" Washington Forum] marks a dangerous breach of the fundamental civilian-military relationship in the United States. Its corrosive premise - that our civilian leadership is not up to the task of deciding the nation's course in war - must be addressed before our military begins to believe that it should have the biggest say in decisions to go to war.

Scales, a military historian and former commandant of the U.S. Army War College (from which I graduated), is a powerful voice among the Army's retired generals. His words are all the more dangerous because they carry such weight.

Civilian control of the military is a fundamental principle of democracies and is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Our Founding Fathers worried deeply about the potential for abuse of military power and designed numerous constitutional safeguards to ensure the military would remain a servant of the state.

Scales purported to speak for a uniformed military leadership that he asserts is at odds with the White House over military action in Syria. Never mind that this decision rests fully with our nation's elected leaders - Congress and the president - exactly as the Constitution prescribes. Nor that the president's decision to consult Congress is intended, properly, to directly engage the American people in this debate through their elected representatives.

Scales's argument implies that, in an era in which the nation's civilian leadership has less and less military experience, only the military has the expertise appropriate to judge the risks and rewards associated with going to war. But under the Constitution, it matters not one whit whether our civilian leadership has experienced war; Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt were neophytes in warfare, and both were superb wartime leaders. Nor does it matter that in the era of an all-volunteer force our population has been largely shielded from exposure to the horrors of war; this is a choice that we, as a society, have made. Civilian leaders are the people's elected representatives; they alone get to choose.

Our senior military leadership performs an essential but separate role: It provides expert advice on military operations - counsel that our elected civilian leaders in Congress and the White House can accept or reject. That advice comes from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and represents the views (if not the consensus) of the service chiefs.

Whatever one's opinion of an all-volunteer military or of diminished military experience among civilians, our men and women in uniform must avoid the temptation to expand the military's role in war-making decisions. They advise through their most senior service leaders and, after a decision is made, execute the mission to the best of their ability. For the military to take on a larger role would erode civilian war-making power and, eventually, civilian control of the military.

Arguments such as Scales's imply that the military has a voice, and vote, of its own - and suggest that channels outside the chain of command are fair game to publicly express dissenting views.

This breach of the proper civilian-military relationship is disruptive and potentially corrosive to our constitutional division of powers. It must be publicly rejected by our uniformed military leadership, who must reassert throughout the ranks the proper role of the military as faithful servants of the nation in the profession of arms. Military leaders must remind their troops that the chain of command represents their outlook to our civilian elected leadership. And despite the disquieting reports, I am confident that respect for these core values of civilian control of the military remains strong throughout our armed forces.

Maybe he just meant to flatter me. Whatever his meaning, I appreciated the sentiment.","I met Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap -- who died on Friday -- twice. The first time was in the Vietnamese military hospital where I was taken shortly after my capture in 1967. My father commanded all U.S. forces in the Pacific, which made me an object of curiosity in some quarters of the North Vietnamese government.

I remember several high-ranking visitors in addition to the guards and interrogators I saw daily. Giap, North Vietnam's minister of defense, was the only one I recognized. He stayed only a few moments, staring at me, then left without saying a word.

Our second meeting was in the early 1990s, during one of many trips I made to Hanoi to discuss the POW/MIA issue and the normalization of relations between our countries. I had asked then-Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach and his deputy, Le Mai, to arrange a brief interview with the legendary commander of the People's Army of North Vietnam.

The next day I was ushered into the grand reception room of the Beaux-Arts presidential palace the French had built for their colonial governors, where the general was waiting. Smiling, diminutive, aged but spry, and dressed in a gray suit and tie, he hardly looked like his wartime reputation as a ruthless fighter with a fierce temper.

Giap greeted me warmly beneath an enormous bust of Ho Chi Minh, who had led Vietnam in the wars against the French and the United States. Both of us clasped each other's shoulders as if we were reunited comrades rather than former enemies.

I had hoped our discussion would concentrate on his historical role. After I came home from Vietnam in 1973, I read everything I could get my hands on about both the French and American wars there, starting with Bernard Fall's ""Hell in a Very Small Place,"" his classic study of the 1954 siege of Dien Bien Phu, where French colonial rule effectively ended and Giap's genius first became apparent to an astonished world.

I wanted to hear Giap describe that nearly two-month long battle, to explain how his forces had shocked the French by managing the impossible feat of bringing artillery across mountains and through the densest jungles. I wanted to talk to him about that other marvel of logistics, the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

I knew he was proud of his reputation as the ""Red Napoleon,"" and I presumed he would welcome an opportunity to indulge my curiosity about his triumphs. I wanted us to behave as two retired military officers and former enemies recounting the historical events in which he had played a critical part and I a small one. But he answered most of my questions briefly, adding little to what I already knew, and then waved his hand to indicate disinterest.

That is all in the past now, he said. You and I should discuss a future where our countries are not enemies but friends. And so we did, two politicians discussing the business between our countries that had brought me to Vietnam.

Giap was a master of logistics, but his reputation rests on more than that. His victories were achieved by a patient strategy that he and Ho Chi Minh were convinced would succeed -- an unwavering resolve to suffer immense casualties and the near total destruction of their country to defeat any adversary, no matter how powerful. ""You will kill 10 of us, we will kill one of you,"" he said, ""but in the end, you will tire of it first.""

Giap executed that strategy with an unbending will. The French repulsed wave after wave of frontal attacks at Dien Bien Phu. The 1968 Tet offensive against the U.S. was a military disaster that effectively destroyed the Viet Cong. But Giap persisted and prevailed.

The U.S. never lost a battle against North Vietnam, but it lost the war. Countries, not just their armies, win wars. Giap understood that. We didn't. Americans tired of the dying and the killing before the Vietnamese did. It's hard to defend the morality of the strategy. But you can't deny its success.

Near the end of our meeting, I made another attempt to test Giap's candor. I asked him if it were true that he had opposed Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. He dismissed that too, with something like, ""the party's decisions are always correct.""

With that, our meeting came to an end. We stood up, shook hands, and as I turned to leave, he grasped my arm, and said softly, ""you were an honorable enemy.""

I don't know if he meant that as a comparison to Vietnam's other adversaries, the Chinese, the Japanese or the French, who had killed his wife, or if it was an implicit recognition we had fought for ideals rather than empire and that our humanity had played a part in our defeat.

"Mullen, Mike",2011,1,2013-11-19,0,0,0,WaPO,Navy,,,M,They Did Not Die in Vain,,"""That these dead shall not have died in vain.""

Of all the lines -- of all the ideas -- in Lincoln's famous speech, this one resonates most with me. Even now, long after I have taken off the uniform, grieving mothers, fathers, sons and daughters approach me and ask, ""Was it worth it? Did his death mean anything?""

I tell them it did. I tell them it mattered.

How could it be otherwise? How could it be that in a democracy -- a free society -- men and women may risk their lives to defend that freedom and lose those lives in vain?

It cannot be so.

Regardless of the terms of the treaty, the surrender, the withdrawal, the defeat or the victory, no American who sheds blood to preserve that which his ancestors fought to establish can ever be said to have made that sacrifice without meaning.

No one who dies in the service of country dies in vain.

It may be easy to forget this when headlines tell of renewed violence in Iraq and a still- active deadly enemy in Afghanistan, with critics saying we achieved nothing.

It's easy to forget it when troops still come home through Dover Air Force Base and are laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, when loved ones grapple with futures snuffed out or with wounds, visible and invisible.

It's easy to forget it when public support for the war effort wanes.

But we should be quick to remember that war, though never glorious, is sometimes necessary, that the soldier is the servant of the state, not the maker of policy, and that sacrifice, though painful, is the price we pay for freedom. For those of us who advised the president to send troops into harm's way, these were never decisions taken lightly.

We should remember that what qualifies a life well-lived and honorably lost is not merely victory on the battlefield but the nobility of the struggle itself -- the courage to take up arms in pursuit of something large.

It was to this idea -- to an America whole and free and not simply to more Union victories -- that Lincoln aspired when he spoke of the lives sold dearly at Gettysburg.

War is an abomination. It is an ugly, dirty, oppressively exhausting business. The soldier no more welcomes it than he does any other deprivation or hardship. Neither should the citizen or the politician.

In war, as in any other facet of life, there are losses more difficult to reconcile -- those caused by accident, faulty judgment, treachery or carelessness. There are losses wholly preventable, even as there are losses wholly necessary. Neither is to be pitied. Neither lacks honor. There is no ""good"" death in war.

Think about how many Civil War fatalities occurred from wounds that today would be mended quickly. Were they less honorable? Were they less purposeful?

Of course not.

As a volunteer nurse, Walt Whitman spent countless hours tending to the wounded in Union hospitals. He read to them, befriended them.

One such friend was Frank Irwin, a young corporal wounded near Fort Fisher in Virginia in 1865. Irwin had been shot through the knee, and the wound became infected.

Whitman wrote to Irwin's mother the day the corporal died from that infection.

""He seem'd quite willing to die,"" wrote Whitman. "". . . And now like many other noble and good men, after serving his country as a soldier, he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service.

""Such things are gloomy,"" he continued, ""yet there is a text: 'God doeth all things well' -- the meaning of which, after due time, appears to the soul.""

More than 6,500 Americans have ""yielded up"" their young lives since these new wars began. Hundreds of thousands of others have returned home forever changed. Their families, too, have suffered yet endured.

As we remember the carnage and the courage of the Civil War, let us likewise honor a new generation of soldiers. As we mourn the dead or spur the wounded to recovery, let us be willing to believe that in due time the meaning of these fresh sacrifices will appear to the soul -- theirs and ours.

Let us take comfort in the knowledge that, whatever the outcome in Iraq and Afghanistan, the precious blood these young people shed for that future shall not -- cannot -- have been shed in vain.",10,Support,,,,,,,76,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444

It would be a mistake to let one man -- increasingly detached from Afghan public and political opinion -- determine the fate of the American role in South Asia. Even with Osama bin Laden dead, the stakes remain high: Extremist groups from Al Qaeda to Lashkar-e-Taiba (the Pakistani group responsible for the 2008 Mumbai terror attack) could easily put down roots again in Afghanistan if the country were to fall to the Taliban after NATO's departure.","What is going on with President Hamid Karzai? The world’s only superpower, leading a
coalition of some 50 nations, is willing to stay on in his country after a war that has already lasted a dozen years
and cost the United States more than $600 billion and more than 2,000 fatalities — and yet the Afghan president
keeps throwing up roadblocks.
The latest insult is his decision to hold off on signing a bilateral security agreement, the legal basis for American
forces to remain in his country past 2014, on the grounds that his successor should have that prerogative next
year. Mr. Karzai has also thrown in new demands — just when we thought the security agreement was a done
deal. For one, he now seems to believe he can compel the United States to release all Afghan detainees in the
prison camp at Guantánamo Bay.
Certainly, part of Mr. Karzai’s attitude comes from the umbrage he has taken at various Americans, especially in
recent years. Some United States officials did make mistakes in their handling of the complex Afghan leader,
lecturing him in public too stridently about matters such as Afghan government corruption. There can be little
doubt, though, that Mr. Karzai’s own peevishness and ingratitude have played a large role.
In addition, Mr. Karzai believes, accurately perhaps, that the talks over the bilateral security agreement provide
him with his last remaining leverage with Washington. He is wrong in thinking that Afghanistan remains a center
of geopolitics, the location of a modern-day “great game” like the 19th-century competition between Britain and
Russia, or the 1980s Cold War struggle pitting the Soviet Union against the United States and others. But Mr.
Karzai is right that we are concerned enough about Afghanistan’s future to wish to maintain a presence even after
NATO’s combat mission expires in just 13 months. He also rightly perceives that the United States wants to keep
a vigilant eye on extremist groups in tribal regions of northwest Pakistan.
Against this backdrop, American officials should stay calm. It would be a mistake to let one man — increasingly
detached from Afghan public and political opinion — determine the fate of the American role in South Asia. Even
with Osama bin Laden dead, the stakes remain high: Extremist groups from Al Qaeda to Lashkar-e-Taiba (the
Pakistani group responsible for the 2008 Mumbai terror attack) could easily put down roots again in Afghanistan if
the country were to fall to the Taliban after NATO’s departure.
The recent assembly of Afghan tribal elders, a loya jirga, again demonstrated what we already knew — that the
Afghan people want us to stay. After the defeat of the Soviets in 1989, civil war, state collapse and Taliban victory
followed. The Afghan people have seen this movie already; they do not want the sequel. The loya jirga urged Mr.
Karzai to sign the agreement; he demurred.
The main candidates in Afghanistan’s 2014 presidential election also want us to stay. A poll by the Moby Group in
Kabul, Afghanistan’s largest private media organization, suggests that the two leading contenders are former
Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani. Both are pro-Western; both are
smart and competent. The same is true of Foreign Minister Zalmay Rassoul, said by some to be President
Karzai’s choice to succeed him after elections in April. Other candidates also support a continuing American and
international presence.
So the United States should stay patient. It can say to Mr. Karzai, If you want to reinforce Afghan democracy by
letting your successor sign this security deal, we can live with that; in the meantime, working with your ministers
and other leaders, we will plan on staying — precisely as if the accord were already in place.
Page 13 of 27 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Of course, the United States can make contingency plans; it would need a Plan B in any event. Even as it
anticipates alternate scenarios, it can continue discussions with Mr. Karzai on the other “conditions” that he has
just introduced. For American leaders, we counsel patience and flexibility in the talks on a security deal.
Let us remember the girls who can go to school — an affront to the Taliban — and the Afghan women who are
increasingly emerging as an important factor in the future of their country. Let’s remember, too, the ethnic
minorities who have found a place and their voice in a modern, forward-looking Afghanistan.
And finally, let’s not forget the progress purchased so dearly in this decade and more of war. We must not permit
Mr. Karzai’s pique to flush all this down the drain.
The United States can ride this one out. And given the enduring American strategic interests in this part of the
world, as well as our huge sacrifice, that’s exactly what we should do.
In the end, this is about the American and the Afghan peoples, not about Hamid Karzai.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,76,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444

This will be a first for Afghanistan, a country where most transitions have been violent. But we need to be patient and realistic as we watch and support this process as it plays out over the spring and summer.

To be sure, the show of democracy in action on Saturday was impressive. When one of us commanded coalition forces during the last major elections there, the parliamentary vote of 2010, security efforts were led by the International Security Assistance Force. Afghans had somewhat more than 200,000 uniformed personnel of varying degrees of preparation, and the Taliban carried out some 500 acts of violence. About five million Afghans voted; more than a million of those votes were ultimately disqualified. Similar figures characterized the 2009 presidential vote, when Hamid Karzai won his second term.

This time, foreign troops, only one-third the number deployed in 2010, played a decidedly secondary role. Afghan forces, now 350,000 strong, provided security, and violent incidents declined to 150 -- still too many, but a big improvement. More than seven million Afghans appear to have voted, after a vigorous campaign that included debates and large rallies across the country, and extensive media coverage.

But as well as the election went, this was just the start. Here are the steps that lie ahead:

1) Vote counts must be officially certified. This is the stage where fraud is uncovered, and remedial steps taken, by independent election authorities within Afghanistan. The formal and final results should come in a few weeks.

2) Assuming that no candidate gets more than 50% of the initial vote, the top two finishers will contest a runoff election. The third-place finisher will have to accept that, despite his high hopes, he will not lead the country into the future, and ask his followers to calmly accept the result.

3) Runoff ballots will have to be printed and distributed, mostly by Afghans, and a second vote held, probably in June. Security could be an even bigger challenge then, as the weather will be warm and the fighting season will be well under way.

4) After the runoff election, vote-counting and certification will take place all over again. With former finance minister Ashraf Ghani and former foreign minister (and 2009 presidential runner-up) Abdullah Abdullah leading in polls before and on election day, the stage could be set for a close race, so the stakes will be higher and the work of independent bodies even more important.

5) Again, the losing candidate will face a crucial test of his character in accepting the result of the runoff. If the vote is tainted by massive cheating, we cannot fairly counsel the loser to passively accept the result, but the more likely scenario is some degree of irregular activity occurring on both sides. In other words, the result -- likely to come in late July or August -- may be somewhat uncertain, but as good as can realistically be hoped.

6) Since the vote itself will be imperfect, and since Afghanistan remains a divided and tense nation, the winner will have to gain legitimacy in part from how he reaches out to the loser and to President Karzai and how he builds a new governing coalition. The formation of the cabinet will be crucial. It must be as multiethnic and inclusive -- and willing to act inclusively -- as the cabinets Mr. Karzai built. The new administration must also be poised to improve Afghanistan's governance and make at least modest quick strides against corruption, a plague within this young nation.

Inauguration day is likely to be in late summer. That would give the new president time to sign the Bilateral Security Accord with the U.S., as all candidates have said they would, and then to sign similar documents with other foreign governments. These agreements will allow a crucial international military presence of advisers and so-called enablers to continue past Dec. 31, albeit at much lower numbers of troops than at present.

All of this can work, and there is good reason to be hopeful. Ashraf Ghani is a brilliant economist well poised to lead a campaign against corruption, and Abdullah Abdullah has been promoting political reform including direct election of governors (now appointed by the president) and a stronger parliament. But none of the remaining process will be easy or unblemished, and it definitely won't be fast.

That's all right. We can wait. Coalition forces have demonstrated patience and resoluteness for 13 years. This has been a tough, frustrating war for the U.S., but our men and women in uniform and their coalition and Afghan partners have served valiantly and with impressive staying power.

extremist proxies as part of its broader geopolitical agenda across the Middle East and beyond - activities
antithetical to U.S. interests and to those of our closest allies.
It is possible that a nuclear deal would pave the way to a broader detente in Iran's relations with the United States
and its neighbors. It is, however, more plausible that removing sanctions would strengthen Tehran's ability to
project malign influence in its near-abroad, including Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, the Arabian peninsula and the
Palestinian territories.
Rather than marking the end of our long struggle with Iran, therefore, a successful nuclear deal could result in the
United States and our partners in the Middle East facing a better-resourced and, in some respects, more
dangerous adversary.
This does not mean we should abandon diplomacy with Tehran. Preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
ought to be our foremost priority, and a diplomatic agreement that truly bolts the door against that danger is worth
potential downsides. Moreover, the alternative to successful diplomacy - military action - carries its own set of
costs and risks to regional stability and the global economy. And military action holds less promise for decisively
ending the nuclear threat than does a good negotiated accord.
But we need to recognize there are genuine trade-offs involved in even the best possible nuclear deal - and start
laying the groundwork for mitigating them. To that end, five actions should be considered.
First, it is imperative to make clear there can be no true reconciliation between Iran and the United States,
regardless of the outcome of the nuclear talks, without a comprehensive change in Iran's destabilizing regional
behavior. Such a message - delivered publicly, unambiguously and consistently - would help eliminate the
corrosive, and inaccurate, perception that Washington is so eager to disengage from the Middle East that it would
accept Iranian hegemony there.

Second, the United States should intensify dialogue with our Arab and Israeli allies to develop a common
understanding about how to contend with an economically strengthened Iran in the wake of a nuclear deal.
Because sanctions relief would bolster Tehran's capability to train, finance and equip its terrorist proxies, we and
our partners in the region must start preparing to intensify our efforts to identify, disrupt and dismantle these
networks.
Third, the United States needs to look hard at its position on Syria, arguably now the central front in a broader
struggle for primacy in the Middle East. Recent reports that the Obama administration has been considering
various forms of increased support to the Syrian opposition - including providing a limited number of strategically
significant weapons systems - are encouraging. These reports, if true, would reflect recognition that a much more
robust, focused and well-resourced effort is required to reverse the Assad regime's current battlefield momentum,
which it has achieved in large part due to Iranian help.
This points to a fourth conclusion: Rather than freeing Washington to reduce the U.S. footprint in the Middle East
and focus elsewhere, a nuclear agreement with Tehran is likely to compel us to deepen our military, diplomatic
and intelligence presence in the region in order to help partners there balance against increasing Iranian power. A
variety of steps should be pursued to this end: approval of additional military capabilities sought by Arab partners
and Israel; a renewed initiative to integrate Gulf Cooperation Council countries' air and ballistic missile defenses;
maritime and air exercises to demonstrate U.S. and partner capabilities in the region; and sustaining, if not
augmenting, existing infrastructure and force posture there.
Fifth, we need to start planning for what a new sanctions regime would look like in the wake of a deal. While a
surge of money to Tehran is inevitable as nuclear-linked sanctions are lifted, sanctions related to terrorism should
remain in place and new ones considered to keep Iranian companies, banks and individuals tied to destabilizing
regional activities from reaping a windfall. Planning for such sanctions must be undertaken in advance of a
nuclear agreement.
There should also be a clear plan for immediate reimposition of crippling sanctions in the event of inadequate
Iranian implementation of an agreement.
All too often in U.S. foreign policy, we set a strategic objective and pursue it doggedly - only to be insufficiently
prepared for the consequences when we achieve our goal. While it remains uncertain whether a worthwhile
nuclear agreement with Iran is attainable, the time for thinking through and preparing for its implications is now.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Gentile, Gian",,1,2014-04-18,0,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,We Need a Fighting Army,"Will the U.S. Army be reduced in size in the coming years? Budget reductions and a changing strategic environment demand a smaller, reorganized army. However, converting it into a force suited only for homeland defense or humanitarian missions abroad, without the ability to fight sophisticated foes as part of a joint force, would result in an unprepared Army likely to experience high casualties when called on to fight a war.","Gen. Matthew Ridgway, who took command of U.S. forces in Korea in December 1950, famously wrote that the
""primary purpose of an army [is] to be ready to fight effectively at all times.""
Ridgway arrived in Korea at a low point in the war: The Chinese had launched a counteroffensive across the Yalu
River and pushed a dispirited and disorganized U.S. Army all the way south past Seoul.
How had the force that had driven the German army across France and back into Germany just five years earlier,
at the end of World War II, lost the ability to fight effectively?
The answer: During those few years, U.S. political leaders had concluded that with the advent of nuclear
weapons, land wars were a thing of the past. Taking this cue, generals had allowed the armored brigade combat
teams from World War II to atrophy. In their place were skeletal divisions of poorly trained U.S. infantry on
constabulary duty in Germany and Japan.
Slightly more than 40 years later, a very different U.S. Army evicted Saddam Hussein's military - a far more
formidable foe than the North Korean army of 1950 - from Kuwait. In 1991, the U.S. Army was not only better
trained and had better resources; it was also working as part of a joint force.
Virtually no Americans anticipated either the North Korean attack in 1950 or Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 40 years
later. That seems to be the pattern: U.S. presidents send the Army to resolve unexpected crises, ready or not.
The world today presents a wide array of potential threats to U.S. interests, including a failed North Korean state
losing control of its weapons of mass destruction, the morass of civil war in Syria, an aggressive and expansionist
Russia or China, or still-unforeseen humanitarian crises in Africa and other areas. If called upon, the U.S. Army
would deploy and engage in peacekeeping operations or major combat between state and non-state actors. In
any event, it needs to be ready.
Some have argued that after the frustrating wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is little American appetite to send
the Army into foreign lands, whether to fight, build nations or distribute humanitarian supplies. This line of thinking
holds that the U.S. Air Force, Navy or Marine Corps can handle most of the security problems the world throws
our way.
Defense expert Kori Schake and retired Navy admiral Gary Roughead, for example, argued last year that the
Army should be reduced to about 290,000 soldiers and have a large part of its capacity for ground combat moved
to the National Guard and Reserve, in effect turning it into a constabulary force capable of humanitarian missions
- in other words, an army that can't fight. A more recent recommendation is for the Army to be reduced to 125,000
soldiers who are highly trained and backed up by the National Guard and Reserve.
These arguments resemble those made in the years leading up to North Korea's invasion of South Korea. Then,
too, it seemed that the world did not need an army that could fight; it was assumed that American ownership of
atomic bombs would somehow do the trick. The result was a near disaster on the Korean Peninsula. Even though
Ridgway's forces held, American casualties were higher than if the Army had been prepared to fight.

Lee Iacocca once ran commercials saying, ""If you can find a better car - buy it!"" The nation cannot find a better man to tackle the challenges of the VA than Ric Shinseki.","After Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki appeared before a Senate committee last week, one television commentator indicated that when Shinseki said he was ""mad as hell"" about problems within the VA hospital system, he didn't actually look all that mad. True, he didn't. But those of us who have known and served with Shinseki realize that this lack of outward emotion should not be read as a lack of passion.

I first met Shinseki 20 years ago, when he was the Army's chief of training. He had a low-key personality, but he was a passionate advocate for obtaining the facilities, equipment and modern concepts that would keep our Army the best in the world. I was impressed.

Shinseki was soon gone from the Pentagon and headed to Fort Hood to command the 1st Cavalry Division, a choice assignment for a young major general. But in a little more than a year he was back in Washington as the Army's assistant deputy chief for operations, yet another select position. He did not like coming back to Washington; he preferred to be with the troops. In speeches, he used to introduce himself simply as, ""My name is Shinseki; I'm a soldier.""

During this time, we were headed back to his office after one rather contentious budget meeting, and I noticed that he was walking slowly and limping slightly. Upon arriving, he gingerly placed a foot on the coffee table and was clearly uncomfortable, although he said nothing until I asked if he had injured himself. ""No, some days it just hurts a bit,"" was all he said. After the meeting, his executive assistant told me, ""You know, he lost most of that foot in Vietnam."" He's never mentioned it to me. The foot, to him, was only an obstacle to overcome. His expression may not change - but neither does his determination.

Ric Shinseki is passionate about those who have served in the military. The screen saver on his office computer used to have the patch of the 1st Cavalry Division constantly scrolling across it with a caption beneath saying: ""No soldier goes into harm's way untrained."" It was his daily reminder of the responsibility of command that he saw as highly personal. None of us were surprised when he became the Army's 34th chief of staff - a Japanese American from Hawaii occupying the seat once held by Douglas MacArthur and Dwight Eisenhower, among other great soldiers.

The Department of Veterans Affairs is a sprawling bureaucracy, operating under procedures largely developed in another era. It may need to change its focus when processing claims from veterans, shifting from an attitude that ""care will be provided when you prove you need it"" to something closer to ""care will be provided until we determine you don't."" As in a court of law, it is often important where the burden of proof lies.

The agency also desperately needs a major investment in its antiquated case-processing system. Today it must deal with the expanded burdens of a decade of conflict - one that has left the nation with the responsibility to care for wounded who in past wars would never have survived their initial injuries, and others with forms of post-traumatic stress disorder that we are only slowly learning to identify and treat.

Running the VA has been a difficult, daunting task for all who have attempted it. The care it provides veterans is superb; but the process by which it determines that care is woefully in need of repair and updating. These fundamental, structural issues will not disappear should Shinseki resign or be forced to leave. They would be left to any successor, and the results would be similar. There are times when organizational failures require a thorough look at the organization itself rather than those trying to manage it - and this is one of those times.

Ric Shinseki is ""mad as hell."" Trust me. His anger doesn't show; he doesn't make for riveting television. But there is no one better prepared, by both professional and personal experience, to attack the problems of running such a complex organization. Lee Iacocca once ran commercials saying, ""If you can find a better car - buy it!"" The nation cannot find a better man to tackle the challenges of the VA than Ric Shinseki.

And, by the way, I am sure while he was seated at that Senate committee hearing table, his foot was still hurting.",6,Support,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444

And what started here will indeed have changed the world, for the better.","The following is adapted from the commencement address by Adm. William H. McRaven, ninth commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, at the University of Texas at Austin on May 17.

The University of Texas slogan is ""What starts here changes the world.""

I have to admit--I kinda like it.

""What starts here changes the world.""

Tonight there are almost 8,000 students graduating from UT.

That great paragon of analytical rigor, Ask.Com, says that the average American will meet 10,000 people in their lifetime.

That's a lot of folks. But if every one of you changed the lives of just 10 people, and each one of those folks changed the lives of another 10 people--just 10--then in five generations, 125 years, the class of 2014 will have changed the lives of 800 million people.

Eight-hundred million people--think of it: over twice the population of the United States. Go one more generation and you can change the entire population of the world--eight billion people.

If you think it's hard to change the lives of 10 people, change their lives forever, you're wrong.

I saw it happen every day in Iraq and Afghanistan.

A young Army officer makes a decision to go left instead of right down a road in Baghdad and the 10 soldiers with him are saved from close-in ambush.

In Kandahar province, Afghanistan, a noncommissioned officer from the Female Engagement Team senses something isn't right and directs the infantry platoon away from a 500-pound IED, saving the lives of a dozen soldiers.

But, if you think about it, not only were these soldiers saved by the decisions of one person, but their children yet unborn were also saved. And their children's children were saved.

Generations were saved by one decision, by one person.

But changing the world can happen anywhere and anyone can do it.

So, what starts here can indeed change the world, but the question is: What will the world look like after you change it?

Well, I am confident that it will look much, much better, but if you will humor this old sailor for just a moment, I have a few suggestions that may help you on your way to a better a world.

And while these lessons were learned during my time in the military, I can assure you that it matters not whether you ever served a day in uniform. It matters not your gender, your ethnic or religious background, your orientation, or your social status. Our struggles in this world are similar and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward--changing ourselves and the world around us--will apply equally to all.

I have been a Navy SEAL for 36 years. But it all began when I left UT for Basic SEAL training in Coronado, Calif.

Basic SEAL training is six months of long, torturous runs in the soft sand, midnight swims in the cold water off San Diego, obstacle courses, unending calisthenics, days without sleep and always being cold, wet and miserable.

It is six months of being constantly harassed by professionally trained warriors who seek to find the weak of mind and body and eliminate them from ever becoming a Navy SEAL.

But, the training also seeks to find those students who can lead in an environment of constant stress, chaos, failure and hardships. To me basic SEAL training was a lifetime of challenges crammed into six months.

So, here are lessons I learned from basic SEAL training that hopefully will be of value to you as you move forward in life.

1. Every morning in basic SEAL training, my instructors, who at the time were all Vietnam veterans, would show up in my barracks room and the first thing they would inspect was your bed. If you did it right, the corners would be square, the covers pulled tight, the pillow centered just under the headboard and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack--that's Navy talk for bed.

It was a simple task, mundane at best. But every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection. It seemed a little ridiculous at the time, particularly in light of the fact that were aspiring to be real warriors, tough battle hardened SEALs, but the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over.

If you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another. By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that little things in life matter.

If you can't do the little things right, you will never do the big things right.

And if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made--that you made--and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.

If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.

2. During SEAL training the students are broken down into boat crews. Each crew is seven students--three on each side of a small rubber boat and one coxswain to help guide the dingy. Every day, your boat crew forms up on the beach and is instructed to get through the surfzone and paddle several miles down the coast.

In the winter, the surf off San Diego can get to be 8 to 10 feet high and it is exceedingly difficult to paddle through the plunging surf unless everyone digs in. Every paddle must be synchronized to the stroke count of the coxswain. Everyone must exert equal effort or the boat will turn against the wave and be unceremoniously tossed back on the beach.

For the boat to make it to its destination, everyone must paddle.

You can't change the world alone--you will need some help--and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friends, colleagues, the goodwill of strangers and a strong coxswain to guide them.

If you want to change the world, find someone to help you paddle.

3. Over a few weeks of difficult training my SEAL class, which started with 150 men, was down to just 42. There were now six boat crews of seven men each.

I was in the boat with the tall guys, but the best boat crew we had was made up of the little guys--the munchkin crew we called them. No one was over about 5-foot-5.

The munchkin boat crew had one American Indian, one African-American, one Polish-American, one Greek-American, one Italian-American and two tough kids from the Midwest.

They out-paddled, out-ran and out-swam all the other boat crews.

The big men in the other boat crews would always make good-natured fun of the tiny little flippers the munchkins put on their tiny little feet prior to every swim. But somehow these little guys, from every corner of the nation and the world, always had the last laugh--swimming faster than everyone and reaching the shore long before the rest of us.

SEAL training was a great equalizer. Nothing mattered but your will to succeed. Not your color, not your ethnic background, not your education and not your social status.

If you want to change the world, measure people by the size of their heart, not the size of their flippers.

4. Several times a week, the instructors would line up the class and do a uniform inspection. It was exceptionally thorough. Your hat had to be perfectly starched, your uniform immaculately pressed and your belt buckle shiny and void of any smudges.

But it seemed that no matter how much effort you put into starching your hat, or pressing your uniform or polishing your belt buckle, it just wasn't good enough. The instructors would find ""something"" wrong.

For failing the uniform inspection, the student had to run, fully clothed, into the surfzone and then, wet from head to toe, roll around on the beach until every part of your body was covered with sand. The effect was known as a ""sugar cookie."" You stayed in that uniform the rest of the day--cold, wet and sandy.

There were many students who just couldn't accept the fact that all their effort was in vain. That no matter how hard they tried to get the uniform right, it was unappreciated.

Those students didn't make it through training. Those students didn't understand the purpose of the drill. You were never going to succeed. You were never going to have a perfect uniform.

Sometimes, no matter how well you prepare or how well you perform, you still end up as a sugar cookie. It's just the way life is sometimes.

If you want to change the world, get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward.

5. Every day during training you were challenged with multiple physical events. Long runs, long swims, obstacle courses, hours of calisthenics--something designed to test your mettle.

Every event had standards, times that you had to meet. If you failed to meet those standards, your name was posted on a list and at the end of the day those on the list were invited to a ""circus.""

A circus was two hours of additional calisthenics designed to wear you down, to break your spirit, to force you to quit. No one wanted a circus. A circus meant that for that day you didn't measure up. A circus meant more fatigue, and more fatigue meant that the following day would be more difficult--and more circuses were likely.

But at some time during SEAL training, everyone--everyone--made the circus list. Yet an interesting thing happened to those who were constantly on the list. Over time those students, who did two hours of extra calisthenics, got stronger and stronger. The pain of the circuses built inner strength--built physical resiliency.

Life is filled with circuses. You will fail. You will likely fail often. It will be painful. It will be discouraging. At times it will test you to your very core.

But if you want to change the world, don't be afraid of the circuses.

6. At least twice a week, the trainees were required to run the obstacle course. The obstacle course contained 25 obstacles including a 10-foot-high wall, a 30-foot cargo net and a barbed-wire crawl, to name a few.

But the most challenging obstacle was the slide for life. It had a three-level, 30-foot tower at one end and a one-level tower at the other. In between was a 200-foot-long rope.

You had to climb the three-tiered tower and, once at the top, you grabbed the rope, swung underneath the rope and pulled yourself hand over hand until you got to the other end.

The record for the obstacle course had stood for years when my class began training in 1977. The record seemed unbeatable until one day a student decided to go down the slide for life--head-first. Instead of swinging his body underneath the rope and inching his way down, he bravely mounted the top of the rope and thrust himself forward.

It was a dangerous move--seemingly foolish, and fraught with risk. Failure could mean injury and being dropped from the training. Without hesitation, the student slid down the rope, perilously fast. Instead of several minutes, it only took him half that time and by the end of the course he had broken the record.

If you want to change the world sometimes you have to slide down the obstacle head-first.

7. During the land-warfare phase of training, the students are flown out to San Clemente Island near San Diego. The waters off San Clemente are a breeding ground for great white sharks. To pass SEAL training, there are a series of long swims that must be completed. One is the night swim.

Before the swim, the instructors joyfully brief the trainees on all the species of sharks that inhabit the waters off San Clemente. The instructors assure you, however, that no student has ever been eaten by a shark--at least not recently.

But, you are also taught that if a shark begins to circle your position, stand your ground. Do not swim away. Do not act afraid. And if the shark, hungry for a midnight snack, darts towards you, then summon up all your strength and punch him in the snout and he will turn and swim away.

There are a lot of sharks in the world. If you hope to complete the swim you will have to deal with them.

So, if you want to change the world, don't back down from the sharks.

8. As Navy SEALs, one of our jobs is to conduct underwater attacks against enemy shipping. We practiced this technique extensively during basic training. The ship-attack mission is where a pair of SEAL divers is dropped off outside an enemy harbor and then swims well over 2 miles--underwater--using nothing but a depth gauge and a compass to get to their target.

During the entire swim, even well below the surface, there is some light that comes through. It is comforting to know that there is open water above you. But as you approach the ship, which is tied to a pier, the light begins to fade. The steel structure of the ship blocks the moonlight, it blocks the surrounding street lamps, it blocks all ambient light.

To be successful in your mission, you have to swim under the ship and find the keel--the centerline and the deepest part of the ship. This is your objective. But the keel is also the darkest part of the ship, where you cannot see your hand in front of your face, where the noise from the ship's machinery is deafening and where it is easy to get disoriented and fail.

Every SEAL knows that under the keel, at the darkest moment of the mission, is the time when you must be calm, composed--when all your tactical skills, your physical power and all your inner strength must be brought to bear.

If you want to change the world, you must be your very best in the darkest moment.

9. The ninth week of SEAL training is referred to as Hell Week. It is six days of no sleep, constant physical and mental harassment and one special day at the Mud Flats. The Mud Flats are an area between San Diego and Tijuana where the water runs off and creates the Tijuana slues--a swampy patch of terrain where the mud will engulf you.

It is on Wednesday of Hell Week that you paddle down to the mud flats and spend the next 15 hours trying to survive the freezing-cold mud, the howling wind and the incessant pressure from the instructors to quit.

As the sun began to set that Wednesday evening, my training class, having committed some ""egregious infraction of the rules"" was ordered into the mud. The mud consumed each man till there was nothing visible but our heads. The instructors told us we could leave the mud if only five men would quit--just five men and we could get out of the oppressive cold.

Looking around the mud flat, it was apparent that some students were about to give up. It was still over eight hours till the sun came up--eight more hours of bone-chilling cold. The chattering teeth and shivering moans of the trainees were so loud it was hard to hear anything. And then, one voice began to echo through the night--one voice raised in song.

The song was terribly out of tune, but sung with great enthusiasm. One voice became two, and two became three, and before long everyone in the class was singing.

We knew that if one man could rise above the misery then others could as well. The instructors threatened us with more time in the mud if we kept up the singing--but the singing persisted. And somehow, the mud seemed a little warmer, the wind a little tamer and the dawn not so far away.

If I have learned anything in my time traveling the world, it is the power of hope. The power of one person--Washington, Lincoln, King, Mandela and even a young girl from Pakistan named Malala--can change the world by giving people hope.

So, if you want to change the world, start singing when you're up to your neck in mud.

10. Finally, in SEAL training there is a bell. A brass bell that hangs in the center of the compound for all the students to see.

All you have to do to quit is ring the bell. Ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at 5 o'clock. Ring the bell and you no longer have to do the freezing cold swims. Ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs, the obstacle course, the PT--and you no longer have to endure the hardships of training. Just ring the bell.

If you want to change the world don't ever, ever ring the bell.

To the graduating class of 2014, you are moments away from graduating. Moments away from beginning your journey through life. Moments away from starting to change the world--for the better.

It will not be easy.

But start each day with a task completed. Find someone to help you through life. Respect everyone. Know that life is not fair and that you will fail often, but if you take some risks, step up when the times are toughest, face down the bullies, lift up the downtrodden and never, ever give up--if you do these things, then the next generation and the generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we have today. And what started here will indeed have changed the world, for the better.

"Honore, Russell",2008,1,2014-05-29,0,0,0,NYT,Army,,1,M,Safeguarding Louisiana's Coastline,"The oil and gas industries and pipeline companies aren’t responsible for all of Louisiana’s coastal loss. Nobody claims that they are. It’s important, though, that the industry be held to account for the damage it has done. Louisiana’s coastline is a vital part of the nation’s defense against natural disasters. It’s time we started treating it so.","After decades of watching our state being ravaged to support the nation's oil and gas
addiction, the people of Louisiana have had enough.
Last summer, an independent government authority responsible for flood protection for the New Orleans area
sued more than 90 oil and gas companies for damaging coastal marshes that protect the city.
The Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority East didn't specify the damages it sought. But the cost of
rebuilding and protecting the state's coastal marshlands has been estimated at roughly $50 billion.
Now those industries and their political allies here in the state capital are trying to kill this legal challenge by
passing a law that would restrict the authority's power to sue over violations of state coastal permits. Proponents
have said it would provide defendants with grounds to seek the lawsuit's dismissal.
This isn't the first effort to kill this lawsuit. More than a dozen bills have been introduced in the State Legislature
since March to effectively do so. All but one has stalled. A final effort to restrict the authority's power to sue these
industries is expected to come Thursday before the State House of Representatives, where it has the support of
the Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, and legislative allies of oil and gas. The bill has already passed the
Senate. The House needs to defeat the bill.
That won't assure us that the oil and gas industries will fix the damage they've caused to our coast over decades.
But it will give the citizens of Louisiana their day in court to stand up and say, ''We've had enough.''
The fertile marshes, tidal flats and barrier islands of coastal Louisiana are among the most productive ecosystems
in the world. These coastal lands provide essential habitat to migratory and native waterfowl. They are home to
shrimp, crabs and oysters that feed the nation. They are the nursery for the rich bounty of marine life in the Gulf of
Mexico and the source of tens of thousands of jobs.
To the people of metropolitan New Orleans and south Louisiana, these coastal lands are also something much
more: the first line of defense against the single greatest threat we face -- catastrophic flooding because of
hurricanes. But these lands have been vanishing before our eyes.
From 1932 to 2000, Louisiana lost an estimated 1,900 square miles of coastal lands, roughly the size of the state
of Delaware. We're on track to lose another 700 square miles over the next few decades unless we stop what the
United States Geological Survey has called the highest rate of wetlands loss in the nation.
Oil, gas and pipeline companies are responsible for a substantial amount of this loss. Over many decades, they
cut more than 10,000 miles of canal and pipeline routes through Louisiana's coastal lands, chopping them up and
exposing them to erosion. The authority says in its lawsuit that this network of canals and pipelines functioned as
''a mercilessly efficient, continuously expanding system of ecological destruction.''
With each acre lost, another vital layer of flood protection goes with it, exposing the region to the force and fury of
hurricanes and storms, impairing the effectiveness of our flood defenses and making the task of safeguarding
New Orleans and the surrounding area more difficult and more costly.
The people of Louisiana cannot bear this loss alone, nor should we.

The levee authority was one of two created in 2006, the year after levee failures left New Orleans flooded when
Hurricane Katrina struck. Outraged by a long history of cronyism and ineptitude in the management of our levee
system, Louisiana voters agreed to authorize the legislature to create professional levee authorities independent
of exactly the kind of political pressure our governor and some in our legislature are trying to apply. Nearly 81
percent of voters statewide supported the plan; in New Orleans, more than 90 percent did.
Today citizens of every political stripe across the state are standing up to demand that these industries respect
the environment and protect our coastline, water and air.
The oil and gas industries and pipeline companies aren't responsible for all of Louisiana's coastal loss. Nobody
claims that they are. It's important, though, that the industry be held to account for the damage it has done.
Louisiana's coastline is a vital part of the nation's defense against natural disasters. It's time we started treating it

"Slear, Thomas",,1,2014-06-08,0,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,My Military Benefits Are Too Generous,"Forfeiting 1 percent of military retirement pay would not shortchange those wounded and disabled in combat, the ones most deserving of benefits. Disabled retirees were promptly exempted from the cut, and there was never a proposal for reducing disability care or benefits. But veteran interest groups refuse to abide by that distinction.","A few weeks ago, I mentioned to a receptionist in a physical therapist's office that I was covered by Tricare, the military's health-care program for service members, retirees and their families. (It has nothing to do with the troubled Veterans Affairs hospital system.)

""Good deal,"" I said.

""You deserve it,"" she responded.

Really? If she only knew.

Though I spent more than five years on active duty during the 1970s as an Army infantry officer and an additional 23 years in the Reserves, I never fired a weapon other than in training, and I spent no time in a combat zone. I returned to active duty for five months in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War, but I was assigned to the Pentagon. My hazardous duty consisted of a daily drive on New York Avenue before its upgrade.

I am hardly unique. Despite the extended operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly half of the 4.5 million active-duty service members and reservists over the past decade were never deployed overseas. Among those who were, many never experienced combat.

It's a fact of warfare called the logistical tail. For every soldier, Marine, sailor or airman whose job is to engage the enemy, there are three or more service members in a well-guarded, reasonably comfortable bivouac area ensuring that the troops are fed, resupplied, paid, entertained and attended to medically.

These jobs are important. Battles are won based on logistics just as much as tactics. But these support jobs aren't particularly hazardous. Police officers, firefighters and construction workers face more danger than Army public affairs specialists, Air Force mechanics, Marine Corps legal assistants, Navy finance clerks or headquarters staff officers.

And yet, the benefits flow lavishly. While on active duty, I received medical care without any premiums or co-pays, a substantial housing allowance, a small stipend for food, and a base salary that by today's pay scale would be $5,168 a month.

Once I joined the Reserves, I started out receiving what today would be $11,000 annually for two days of drill per month and 13 days of active duty per year. That increased to $17,600 when I retired in 2001.

Even though I spent 80 percent of my time in uniform as a reservist, I received an annual pension in 2013 of $24,990, to which I contributed no money while serving. (Reserve retirement pay does not start until you turn 60. For those who remain on active duty for at least 20 years, payments start the month they leave service. Those who enlist at 18, right out of high school, can retire at 38 and receive $26,000 a year for the rest of their lives.)

My family and I have access to U.S. military bases worldwide, where we can use the fitness facilities at no charge and take advantage of the tax-free prices at the commissaries and post exchanges. The most generous benefit of all is Tricare. This year I paid just $550 for family medical insurance. In the civilian sector, the average family contribution for health care in 2013 was $4,565, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Simply put, I'm getting more than I gave. Tricare for military retirees and their families is so underpriced that it's more of a gift than a benefit. A fourfold increase in premiums would leave Tricare safely on the side of hearty largesse, yet the Pentagon's attempts to raise premiums by as little as 10 percent have had shelf lives shorter than ice cubes.

The budget agreement last year included a trim of 1 percentin the cost-of-living increase in military retirement pay for those under 62. Predictably, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Military Officers Association of America would have none of it. ""Breaking faith"" is how the MOAA's chairman characterized the deal.

Oh, please. One percent on a non-contributing pension while the retirees are still in their productive working years? That's not breaking faith. It would be a judicious concession to the expanding federal deficit and would go largely unnoticed by recipients.

Forfeiting 1 percent of military retirement pay would not shortchange those wounded and disabled in combat, the ones most deserving of benefits. Disabled retirees were promptly exempted from the cut, and there was never a proposal for reducing disability care or benefits. But veteran interest groups refuse to abide by that distinction.

In this time of excessive expenditures for government pensions, wouldn't a very small decrease in pay to military retirees be reasonable, particularly during the period of their lives when they are fully capable of civilian employment?

Instead, it's all or nothing. As Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) said on the Senate floor in February: ""You vote yes, you're for our vets. You vote no, you're against our vets.""

Either Begich and his colleagues fully back military benefits regardless of the expense, or they become political dead meat.

The draft ended more than 40 years ago and with it the public's direct association with the military. Nowadays most Americans don't know a sergeant from a general, an infantrymen from a mail clerk, or an Army Commendation Medal from a Silver Star.

What they do know comes from watching movies such as ""Lone Survivor,""""Zero Dark Thirty,""""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Black Hawk Down,"" in which nearly everyone in uniform comes across as a heroic warrior. What ensues is a combination of guilt and relief: Thank God those in uniform are willing to do what I don't even want to think about. And suddenly no benefit is excessive or paycheck too large.

Our service members are paid well, particularly those who join with no more than a high school education. The benefits are substantial and pensions are generous, especially when compared with civilian plans.

This is not to say that we shouldn't sweeten the pot for our service members to some degree. Though I never served in combat, I was trained and ready to go when called. That's worth something. Those who went to Iraq or Afghanistan and never left a base camp still disrupted their family lives for months on end. That's worth something. And those wounded in action deserve the best care possible and reasonable disability benefits.

But budget deficits are tilting America toward financial malaise. Our elected representatives will have to summon the courage to confront the costs of benefits and entitlements and make hard choices. Some ""no"" votes when it comes to our service members and, in particular, military retirees will be necessary. We can afford it.",5,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Keane, Jack",2003,1,2014-06-16,0,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,A Plan to Save Iraq from ISIS and Iran,"Are these prescriptions a guarantee of victory? No. Are Iraqis and Syrians and all their neighbors worthy of another American investment? That's not the right question. This is not just about them. This is about the security of the U.S., our allies and our vital interests. If we do nothing -- if our imagination fails us once again -- it is the American people who again will pay a terrible price. Weighed against the limited requirements to help Iraqis and Syrians fight for themselves, that is well worth the effort.","The Middle East is in a downward spiral. More than 160,000 have died in Syria's civil war, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, aka ISIS, has captured key Iraqi cities and is marching on Baghdad, and the security investments made by the U.S. over the past decade -- like them or not -- are being frittered away.

It is still possible to reverse the recent gains of ISIS, an outgrowth of what was once al Qaeda in Iraq. The group's fighters number only in the thousands, and while well-armed, they lack the accoutrements of a serious military. But only the United States can provide the necessary military assistance for Baghdad to beat back our shared enemy.

Setting aside for the moment the question of whether this administration has the will to intervene again in Iraq, here are the components of a reasonable military package that can make a difference:

-- Intelligence architecture. Iraq's intel screens went blank after the U.S. military pulled out in 2011. Washington needs to restore Baghdad's ability to access national, regional and local intelligence sources, enabling the Iraqi military to gain vital situational awareness.

-- Planners and advisers. The Iraqi military needs planners to assist with the defense of Baghdad and the eventual counter-offensive to regain lost territory, as well as advisers down to division level where units are still viable.

-- Counterterrorism. Special operations forces should be employed clandestinely to attack high value ISIS targets and leaders in Iraq and Syria.

-- Air power. Air power alone cannot win a war, but it can significantly diminish enemy forces and, when used in coordination with ground forces, can exponentially increase the odds of success.

ISIS has made extraordinary progress in recent weeks in Iraq and controls large swaths of territory in northern Syria. But its forces are not impregnable and their tactics are not terribly complicated. ISIS has progressed via two main routes in Iraq, traveling during the day in columns. Its forces and staging areas are exposed targets -- but the Iraqis have very limited air power.

Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and some of the necessary target development have already begun on the Iraq side; the U.S. needs to expand them to the Syria side of the Iraqi-Syrian border. We need to know more about who is moving, how they're moving, who is helping, and how to stop them. This target information will assist air interdiction and non-American ground forces to counter ISIS.

The next necessary step is air interdiction of ISIS staging areas, supplies, sanctuaries and lines of communication. To be effective, this must address targets in both Iraq and Syria. Air interdiction alone will not achieve a victory, but it is a necessary component for follow-on ground operations. And hitting ISIS in Iraq without hitting it in Syria will allow the enemy to reserve its strength for another effort.

President Obama is reportedly considering providing elements of the Free Syrian Army with weaponry and other tools to begin to push back on both Iranian-backed Syrian forces and al Qaeda and Gulf-backed Islamist extremists. Remember, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) is the only force in Syria that has attacked ISIS. The Assad regime and ISIS enjoy a cordial entente and do not attack each other. Should President Obama choose to do so, air interdiction against targets inside Syria will be a boost that allows FSA moderates to gain ground they have lost over the past year.

After interdiction, the next step will be providing air cover. As the terrorists and Iraqi Security Forces face each other, the Iraqis are going to need close U.S. air support. That means coordination with ground forces, a task that was simpler with U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq, but is now substantially more complex. Iraqis cannot facilitate our targeting.

Without air-ground controllers, this requires U.S. special forces to assist the locals. Far from the ""boots on the ground"" meme that has been so vilified in Washington, this is a job for which special forces have been trained. It is not combat, but it is the kind of partnership and facilitation that should have been left in place once the bulk of our troops left Iraq in 2011.

These are all arms-length measures, and they will likely stop the advance of ISIS on the ground in Iraq. Air power will also help to defend Baghdad and interdict ISIS, but at some point there will need to be a counteroffensive to take back land now held by the enemy.

The largely Shiite forces that make up the Iraqi army cannot win alone, especially as Sunni extremists join forces with ISIS. They must turn to Kurdish Peshmerga troops for assistance. This will not be an easy choice for the Kurdish leadership. But the Kurdistan Regional Government is playing with fire if it believes that ISIS and its ilk are the road to a more stable Middle East. A fragmented Iraq based on terrorist rule will not enable continuity of oil supplies or security for Kurdish population centers.

The Syrians and the Iraqis have made their own beds -- so why stick our noses in now? The answer is that al Qaeda, ISIS and others will not stop at Iraq and Syria. Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and others will be next.

Think subcontracting the job to Iran is the right call? Surely, no one wishes a Middle East managed by the ayatollahs in Tehran. Don't care? Remember the admonition of the 9/11 Commission: ""The most important failure was one of imagination."" Imagine what controlling vast areas of the Middle East will do for extremists of all stripes.

Yes, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has failed dismally to include Sunnis in Iraq's government, military and economy -- with disastrous effects. Nonetheless, President Obama's formulation -- that the U.S. will provide assistance only if Mr. Maliki makes necessary reforms -- assumes that we have some leverage over Baghdad. To the contrary, Washington will earn far more leverage if it is willing to step in and provide the kind of support that should have been there in the years after victory. Only then will Mr. Obama have the influence and the trust to bring together Iraqis to reconstitute a foundation that can withstand the predations of ISIS, Iran and others.

Are these prescriptions a guarantee of victory? No. Are Iraqis and Syrians and all their neighbors worthy of another American investment? That's not the right question. This is not just about them. This is about the security of the U.S., our allies and our vital interests. If we do nothing -- if our imagination fails us once again -- it is the American people who again will pay a terrible price.

"Davis, Morris",,1,2014-06-20,0,0,0,NYT,Air Force,,1,M,No to Guantanamo for Khattala,"When it comes to Mr. Abu Khattala and Guantanamo, the question is not could we, but should we? And the answer is no. ","NEARLY eight years ago, 14 men arrived at Guantánamo after years in Central Intelligence Agency custody. Since
then, only one has been tried and convicted with the case upheld on appeal. That was Ahmed Ghailani, a
Tanzanian national who received a life sentence for his role in the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 223 people. Mr. Ghailani was tried in federal court in New York, and he is serving
his sentence in a federal prison in the United States. His 13 comrades from the C.I.A. detention and interrogation
program are still in limbo at Guantánamo, where justice for them and the families of their victims remains elusive.
When word got out that Ahmed Abu Khattala, suspected of being the ringleader of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the
United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three
other Americans, had been captured, it was inevitable that some would demand sending him to Guantánamo.
Among the Guantánamo advocates who argue that Mr. Abu Khattala should be interrogated there as an enemy
combatant are Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two individuals I worked with in 2006 when I was the
chief prosecutor for the Guantánamo military commissions.
Back then, Senators McCain and Graham stood up against those in the administration of President George W.
Bush who wanted harsh tactics and rigged justice, and I have great respect for the way they swam against the
political current. But they are wrong now to oppose the Obama administration's plan to bring Mr. Abu Khattala to the
United States to stand trial in a federal court.
Too often, the public falls prey to the superficial argument that we are in a war against terrorism and that foreign
terrorism suspects do not deserve the rights afforded American citizens. That seems sensible on its face, but what
is it exactly that needs to be compromised in terrorism cases to ensure that the guilty face justice while also
protecting our national security? What would we gain, in other words, by sending Mr. Abu Khattala to Guantánamo?
The United States has been roundly condemned by allies and adversaries alike for the legal black hole we created
at Guantánamo. In the 2008 presidential race, both Mr. McCain and his opponent, Barack Obama, said they wanted
to close the detention camp. Senator McCain issued a joint statement with Senator Dianne Feinstein a year ago
that said, ''It is in our national interest to end detention at Guantánamo.'' Adding to the prison's population now
would not contribute to that effort and would undermine the small gains that have been made toward unraveling this
Gordian knot.
Collecting intelligence from Mr. Abu Khattala is a top priority, true, but there is nothing special about Guantánamo
that makes it the best place to question him. Guantánamo was chosen originally because some in the Bush
Page 2 of 3
No to Guantánamo for Khattala
administration thought it was beyond the reach of the law -- the perfect place, they thought, to exploit people for
intelligence, free and clear of judicial oversight.
Over time, however, it has become clear that Guantánamo is not the legal no man's land it was thought to be. The
Supreme Court has held that detainees have the right to an attorney and to challenge in federal court the basis for
their detention. Senator McCain led the way in passing the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 that banned ''cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment'' of those in military custody. The notion that, by sending Mr. Abu Khattala to
Guantánamo, we could hide him from outside scrutiny while applying some extraordinary measures to make him
talk is simply false.
President Bush authorized military commissions -- tribunals that operate without key elements of civilian courts' due
process -- in November 2001. In the more than 12 years since, only eight individuals have been convicted, and
each process has been surrounded by controversy. For example, the only military commission completed during my
two-year tenure as chief prosecutor was the trial of David Hicks, who was convicted of providing material support
for terrorism. Later, in another case, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that
material support was not a legitimate law of war offense that could be tried by a military commission.
In contrast, hundreds of terrorism-related cases have been prosecuted successfully and without adverse incident in
federal courts during the same period, including the trials of the radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, Osama bin
Laden's son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, and Mr. Ghailani. Meanwhile, at Guantánamo, the military commission
proceedings against Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and those accused with him in the 9/11 attacks are into their third
year -- with no firm date yet set for a trial.
Given the controversy surrounding what happened at Benghazi, it is especially important for the Abu Khattala case
to be presented in the sunlight of a federal court, where the public can see and hear the evidence and draw its own
conclusions. Rather than languishing for years and being obscured by the opaque standards that plague the military
commissions at Guantánamo, this case deserves the certainty, the efficiency and the clarity that our federal courts
provide.
When it comes to Mr. Abu Khattala and Guantánamo, the question is not could we, but should we? And the answer
is no.",6,Warfighting,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Abizaid, John and Brooks, Rosa",2007,1,2014-06-27,0,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,We Need a Rulebook for Drones,"Current U.S. drone policies open the door to a dangerous and unstable future. Yes, states must be able to respond effectively to nontraditional threats from nontraditional actors, but whenever lethal force is used, it must also be consistent with the rule of law and fundamental human rights. In the end, U.S. security rests not only on a strong military but also its ability to offer credible leadership, consistent with our longstanding values.","To understand why U.S. drone strikes outside traditional battlefields make so many people so uneasy, look to the
past and look to the future.
Start with the past. In 1976, exiled Chilean dissident Orlando Letelier was driving to work in Washington when a
car bomb planted by Chilean agents ripped through his vehicle, killing Letelier and his young, American assistant.
From the viewpoint of Chile's ruling military junta, the killing was justifiable: Gen. Augusto Pinochet's regime
considered itself at war with leftist insurgents and viewed Letelier as a security threat.
U.S. authorities saw things differently, of course: They condemned the bombing as an assassination. The FBI
opened a murder investigation, and the Senate intelligence committee launched an inquiry into illegal foreign
intelligence activities on U.S. soil.
Now, imagine the future: Suppose Russian President Vladimir Putin decided that a few drone strikes in eastern
Ukraine would be just the thing to eliminate some particularly irritating critic of Russian policy.
If this happened, U.S. authorities would surely denounce the strikes, just as they denounced Letelier's killing. But
Putin would surely respond by parroting the U.S. government's justifications for drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen
and Somalia. ""First,"" he might say, ""I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any such Russian strikes.
Second, I assure you that all Russian decisions to use lethal force comply fully with applicable law. Russia targets
only terrorist combatants who pose an imminent threat to Russia, and it uses force inside other sovereign states
only when those states are themselves unwilling or unable to address the threat.""
The United States would naturally demand evidence that those killed were truly dangerous terrorists, but Putin
could again take a page from our book. ""Unfortunately,"" he'd respond, ""we can't make public such sensitive
national security information.""
What could U.S. officials possibly say? They may know that they use lethal force only against those who
constitute lawful targets under international law - but it's hard to convince the rest of the world that ""trust us"" is a
good enough basis for killing thousands of people in the territory of other sovereign states.
We both have enormous respect for the men and women charged with keeping our nation safe and believe that
there are many circumstances in which drone strikes are entirely appropriate. Nonetheless, we are troubled by
the lack of transparency and accountability surrounding U.S. use of targeted strikes far from traditional
battlefields, as well as the lack of strategic clarity.
The United States' drone policies damage its credibility, undermine the rule of law and create a potentially
destabilizing international precedent - one that repressive regimes around the globe will undoubtedly exploit. As
lethal drones proliferate, the future imagined above is becoming all too likely.
Recent events remind us that the threat posed by terrorist organizations is very real, and U.S. drone strikes have
achieved significant tactical successes in certain regions, but the scope, number and lethality of terrorist attacks
Page 106 of 168 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
worldwide suggest that these successes are not producing enduring strategic gains. On the contrary:
Overreliance on targeted strikes away from so-called ""hot"" battlefields creates a substantial risk of backlash and
reinvigorated terrorist recruiting and may create a slippery slope leading to continual or wider conflict.
In his recent speech at West Point, President Obama acknowledged many of these concerns. It is time for him to
take action to address them.
The court-ordered release Monday of the legal basis for the U.S.-targeted killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.
citizen, provides the public with some useful information, but much more is needed. The government should make
public the approximate number and general location of U.S. drone strikes; the number of people known to have
been killed and their organizational affiliations; and the number and identities of any civilians killed. In addition,
Obama should create an independent, nonpartisan commission to review lethal drone strikes and should transfer
responsibility for strikes from the CIA to the military. Finally, we believe the United States must take the lead in
fostering the development of appropriate international norms for the use of lethal force outside traditional
battlefields.
Current U.S. drone policies open the door to a dangerous and unstable future. Yes, states must be able to
respond effectively to nontraditional threats from nontraditional actors, but whenever lethal force is used, it must
also be consistent with the rule of law and fundamental human rights. In the end, U.S. security rests not only on a
strong military but also its ability to offer credible leadership, consistent with our longstanding values.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Barno, David ",2006,1,2014-07-13,0,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,The Army's Next Enemy? Peace.,"After Vietnam, then-Col. Wayne Downing, who later commanded all U.S. Special Operations forces, challenged his Rangers to avoid becoming ""milicrats"" - bureaucrats in khaki focused on process and rules at the expense of bold thinking and battlefield results. Fortunately, senior Army leaders of that era underwrote a decentralized culture. They gave cover to their young officers to make tough choices and backed them up.","The Army is emerging from 13 years of war, battle-tested but weary. It is under pressure from budget cuts, the return of nearly the entire force to domestic bases, and a nation wary of deploying land power after two long conflicts. Yet perhaps the most important challenge facing the Army is not about finances, logistics or public opinion, but about culture - its own.

A conflict looms between the Army's wartime ethos of individual initiative and the bureaucratic malaise that peacetime brings. The Army is about to make an abrupt shift: from a sizable, well-resourced, forward-deployed, combat-focused force to a much smaller, austerely funded, home-stationed service. Training and preparation for war will take the place of actually waging it. The Army is moving from 13 straight years of playing in the Super Bowl to an indefinite number of seasons scrimmaging with itself.

While few in the service would prefer unending wartime deployments over some semblance of peace, the end of full-scale conflict brings unique challenges to those in uniform - especially to those millennials in active service who, since 2001, have experienced nothing but the adrenaline rush of an Army at war. This transition could weaken the Army's warfighting capabilities and drive talented, combat-experienced young leaders from the force.

The Army faced a similar situation after Vietnam. Home after a decade in Southeast Asia, its senior officers confronted demands to shrink the Army rapidly and return it to a peacetime footing. With inadequate funds, poor discipline, worn equipment and outdated warfighting doctrines all competing for attention, Army leaders aggressively attacked these problems - but were also far-sighted enough to realize that leadership of a peacetime force would be a critical challenge.

The Army's senior leaders of the 1970s had endured the trials of Vietnam as mid-grade combat commanders, and they understood that the traits required for battlefield success - bold decision-making and individual leadership - would be quickly stamped out in a peacetime, rule-focused force. So they took action.

In 1979, the Army chief of staff, Gen. Edward ""Shy"" Meyer, advanced the controversial idea of ""selective disobedience"" as a way to empower junior leaders in the face of stultifying Army bureaucracy. His comments sparked a furious debate in the force, but as a young infantry company commander at the time, I knew exactly what he meant. He did not mean that we should ignore laws or violate ethical standards. But in a peacetime Army, the demands of burgeoning policies, regulations and requirements vastly exceeded the time available to comply, so leaders were empowered to set priorities and make choices. We could say no - we were even expected to say no. As I recall Gen. Robert Shoemaker telling us in a 1980 speech to leaders of the Army's 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii: You will impress me, he said, if I come to your training site and you tell me what parts of my guidance you have chosen not to follow. You will really impress me if you have already told my staff and explained why.

Similarly, Lt. Gen. Walter Ulmer led an Army-wide campaign, beginning in the early 1980s, that he christened ""power down,"" designed to wrest authority out of the hands of petty Army bureaucrats and drive it down to the lowest possible level. The signature of an officer was his or her bond, and Army regulations and local policies were scrubbed to ensure that the authority inherent in that signature was treated seriously. For instance, mid-grade noncommissioned officers were given the authority to be ""officers-in-charge"" of live fire ranges, a sea change in a culture that previously pushed more and more responsibility into the hands of its officers and undercut its sergeants.

Today's Army officially embraces a leadership concept called Mission Command, and it resonates with the initiatives launched after Vietnam. At its simplest, Mission Command dictates that senior leaders provide guidance and intent - the what and the why - and that subordinate leaders have maximum latitude to design the how. It embodies deep trust between senior and subordinate.

Mission Command is how the Army fights its wars. It has been the default setting in Iraq and Afghanistan, where small units led by junior leaders have been scattered across the battlefield. Many of these young captains, lieutenants and sergeants saw their immediate supervisors infrequently, but all strived to operate within the intent of those higher commanders every day.

Regardless of the strategic outcomes of these recent wars, decentralized Mission Command has succeeded, empowering junior leaders to act boldly within their commanders' broad intent. For example, when the raid into Pakistan to kill or capture Osama bin Laden went awry with a helicopter crash, the assault force immediately pressed on to accomplish the overall mission - without receiving detailed new orders from commanders thousands of miles away.

But Mission Command is now on a collision course with the peacetime Army, which values bureaucratic process and compliance above all else. Completing surveys and online training on time, mastering PowerPoint briefings, and grasping the intricacies of training management and readiness reporting all dominate the life of leaders in garrison. In combat, risk of death or failure is a daily hazard. In peacetime, risk-taking is systematically extinguished by layers of rules, restrictions and micromanagement aimed at avoiding any possible shortcomings. Peacetime procedures tend to crush the very attributes required for successful unit combat leaders. If not corrected, this conflict will drive out many of the Army's best young wartime leaders and demoralize the rest.

It is not at all clear that today's Army leadership even recognizes the problem - much less is doing anything about it. Early this year, a gruff Army one-star general addressed a room full of new company commanders and first sergeants at a large combat installation. His topic was ""garrison leadership"" - the transition from war to a home-station military. He, like every other serving general, grew up in the Army of the 1990s and long ago mastered the maze of peacetime training and bureaucracy. (By the era, efforts to push back against creeping bureaucracy had already waned.) According to attendees I spoke with, his message to a room packed with combat veterans boiled down to this: Suck it up. We are going back to the Army before the war. It was good enough for me; it will be good enough for you.

His audience - captains and senior noncommissioned officers with multiple combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan - represented a generation of young leaders who have grown up in the Army since Sept. 11, 2001. In today's force, every lieutenant and captain, and many young majors, came into the Army in the years after 9/11, and most mid-grade and many senior sergeants did the same. Their Army has known nothing but war.

Now their Army and their lives will be dominated by policies, regulations - and e-mail. Of course, modern communications technology has enabled remarkable connectivity on the battlefield during the past decade's wars, but its unintended and corrosive effects in peacetime will rapidly wear down the initiative required by Mission Command.

Far from facing peril on the battlefield, company commanders in the new home-station Army are becoming prisoners of their inboxes - just one example of a bureaucratic, micromanaged culture reemerging as the wars end. Nearly all carry government-issued smartphones and check them constantly. It may seem like a minor matter in today's hyper-connected world, but within the military, the effects are pernicious.

During wartime, military bureaucracy plays on in the background, muted. But now, officials scattered across the vast defense establishment - from battalion and brigade headquarters staffs to installation safety offices to the Department of the Army staff in the Pentagon - regularly dictate instructions, briefings, surveys and policies to far-flung company commanders. Even though such officials nearly always reside outside the unit chain of command, their influence is strong. Commanders must respond promptly to this barrage from every imaginable interest group inside the Army. This compliance culture erodes wartime chain-of-command precepts and compromises the accountability and authority vested in unit commanders. It represents the extreme opposite of what small unit commanders are expected to do at war.

In many ways, the Army is in denial of this looming problem. Its senior officers need to take on this challenge directly. They must embrace and protect a leadership philosophy anchored in trust - one that imbues the Army's peacetime operations with the wartime precepts of Mission Command. And most of all, these senior leaders need to listen to their young combat leaders of the past 10 years, the individuals who will eventually lead this Army. They must empower their young leaders to say no to the bureaucracy, or they risk creating a generation of compliant officers unprepared for the ""think on your feet"" nature of modern war.

After Vietnam, then-Col. Wayne Downing, who later commanded all U.S. Special Operations forces, challenged his Rangers to avoid becoming ""milicrats"" - bureaucrats in khaki focused on process and rules at the expense of bold thinking and battlefield results. Fortunately, senior Army leaders of that era underwrote a decentralized culture. They gave cover to their young officers to make tough choices and backed them up.

A failure to do the same today would exact high costs. As a young captain with multiple combat deployments recently told me: ""They won't have to shrink the force; lots of great people will leave because they are going to make it too painful for them to stay.""",9,ServiceCulture,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Hayden, Michael and Bayh, Evan",2008,0,2014-07-17,0,0,0,WSJ,Air Force,,,M,A Doubly Dangerous Iran,"What is missed is that Tehran and Washington have incompatible strategic objectives. The U.S. needs a stable and inclusive Iraq, while Iran's ambitions lie in preserving a Shiite-dominated state that relies on Tehran for its survival. If we are not careful, the clerical regime will seek to leverage the chaos in Mesopotamia to extract nuclear concessions from us before the Sunday deadline for a deal as talks continue in Vienna this week. We need to be careful not to create indebtedness, even perceived indebtedness.","The temptation is obvious: Iraq is threatened by a radical Sunni insurgency. The United States and Shiite Iran thus have common interest in blunting the success of an al Qaeda offshoot. The enemy of my enemy is my situational ally.

What is missed is that Tehran and Washington have incompatible strategic objectives. The U.S. needs a stable and inclusive Iraq, while Iran's ambitions lie in preserving a Shiite-dominated state that relies on Tehran for its survival. If we are not careful, the clerical regime will seek to leverage the chaos in Mesopotamia to extract nuclear concessions from us before the Sunday deadline for a deal as talks continue in Vienna this week. We need to be careful not to create indebtedness, even perceived indebtedness.

The Middle East is a region that seems always to divide against itself. In the past, radical republics contested the legitimacy of conservative monarchies; today's divisions are defined by sectarian identities deeply rooted in Islam. Iran and its Shiite proxies are arduously trying to undermine the Sunni order led by Saudi Arabia. This struggle rages in Lebanon and the Gulf, and most bloodily in Syria and Iraq.

As the conflict grows, America has been reluctant to engage, insensitive to our regional allies' concerns, and unusually deferential to our adversaries' ambitions. Although Iran would welcome a stable Shiite-dominated Iraq, it has little interest in an Iraq where Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds cooperate. Iranian ambitions are best served by Shiite authoritarians in Baghdad who dominate the country's Sunni citizens and are at odds with Sunni Arabs elsewhere.

Washington can ignore neither the Islamic Republic's nefariousness among the Middle East's Shiites nor Tehran's hegemonic designs. If Tehran continues to arm Shiite militias, deploy the lethal Quds Force and press Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to exclude moderate Sunni elements from his government, Washington should respond.

There are many tools available, including economic sanctions. However, America must not bluff: We must realize that U.S. interests in the Middle East are not tangential to our national security but are essential to counterterrorism, thwarting nuclear proliferation and promoting stable, representative governments.

It is equally imperative to prevent the turmoil in Iraq and Syria from easing America's red lines on Iran's nuclear program. Countering the nuclear challenge from Tehran is straightforward: The U.S. and its allies have to demand and devise an Iranian civilian nuclear program that cannot be exploited for military purposes. To achieve that goal, the White House must make clear that the hardened uranium-enrichment facility in Fordow must be closed and not transformed into an easily convertible research-and-development installation. The Arak plutonium plant has to be similarly neutered. And finally, the main enrichment facility at Natanz has to be dramatically scaled back and all enriched uranium shipped abroad for fuel reprocessing.

Washington must also insist on a credible verification regime. The Islamic Republic has to come clean about all of its past weaponization activities. If the purpose of an agreement is to put distance between current capacities and nuclear breakout, how can outsiders reliably calculate how quickly an Iranian decision to weaponize could be put into effect without a thorough accounting of past actions?

Iran must also submit to intrusive inspections, without challenge or delay, at any site identified by the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency. This means snap examinations of any suspect facility by inspectors permanently stationed in Iran.

One of the problems with the Joint Plan of Action -- signed in late 2013 by Iran and six other powers, including the U.S. -- is that it stipulates that any final agreement on Tehran's nuclear program will have a sunset clause. Upon its expiration, whenever that may be, Iran would be free to build up an industrial-size program, giving it the ability to manufacture an arsenal of nuclear arms at short notice. It is unclear what legitimate purpose is served by this. The sunset clause must be removed.

There are also great dangers if the interim agreement under the Joint Plan of Action is succeeded by another interim agreement or even if the current negotiating window is extended by another six months. The administration will be sorely tempted to let negotiations continue to drag on, hoping that the Iranians will relent and drop their resistance to any meaningful rollback of their nuclear program.

But the current lull during the ""freeze"" on Iranian nuclear development limits only some nuclear activities; the Iranians continue to build other essential elements, such as improving the efficiency of centrifuges. As centrifuge-enrichment capacity increases, Tehran's ability to construct clandestine enrichment sites alarmingly grows. (The lull also has let the Iranian economy improve; inflation is down and their currency has strengthened, further reducing our leverage.) Time is not on our side.

The Islamic Republic is a rash, revolutionary regime at odds with America's core interests in the Middle East. It is a state ruled by men such as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei whose worldview is shaped by conspiracy theories and enduring enmity toward the West. Tehran seeks dominance over its Arab neighbors, sows discord through the region and actively supports terrorist organizations. It is only in this context that Tehran's quest for nuclear weapons can be understood.

All is not lost, and an energized America and its allies can still make a difference in Iraq and Syria. But abandoning the chimera of Iranian cooperation is a precondition. To paraphrase the tribal proverb, while the enemy of my enemy may appear to be America's friend, with the Iranian regime, that is an illusion. Their enmity trumps all.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Taguba, Antonio",2007,1,2014-08-08,0,0,0,NYT,Army,,,M,Stop the CIA Spin on Torture,"Ultimately, as we learned with Abu Ghraib, the best way of guarding against torture is an American public well informed about the moral and strategic costs of such abuse. In the absence of an open accounting, polls show that support for torture among Americans has increased over recent years as proponents sow doubt about whether abusive interrogation is, in fact, illegitimate. So I am very concerned by the pre-emptive efforts of the C.I.A. to derail what we know to be strong criticism of the agency's conduct during the ""war on terror.""","THE Senate Intelligence Committee will soon release key sections of its report on the Central Intelligence Agency's detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects after 9/11. In remarks on Friday anticipating the report's release, which he has publicly supported, President Obama acknowledged that ""we tortured some folks.""

In fact, from leaks to the press and the statements of those familiar with the report, we know the committee has determined that C.I.A. torture was more widespread and brutal than Americans were led to believe. The committee reportedly has also found that the C.I.A. misled Bush administration officials and Congress about the extent and nature of the torture, and that torture was ineffective for intelligence gathering.

Even though a bipartisan majority of the committee voted to declassify the report, there is a concerted effort to discredit it by depicting it as partisan and unfair. The report's detractors include the C.I.A. itself: The agency's rebuttal will be released alongside the report's key sections. While the C.I.A. is under no obligation to stay silent in the face of criticism, it seems that between its apparently excessive redactions and its spying on the committee's computers, the agency is determined to resist oversight.

Yet I know from experience that oversight will help the C.I.A. -- as it helped the United States military. Ten years ago, I was directed by Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the senior officer in Iraq, to investigate allegations of detainee abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. My report's findings, which prompted a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, documented a systemic problem: military personnel had perpetrated ""numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses.""

The findings, along with what became infamous images of abuse, caused a stir and led to prosecutions. The inquiry shed light on our country's trip to the dark side, in which the United States government engaged in an assault on American ideals, broke the law and in so doing strengthened our enemies.

What I found in my investigation offended my sense of decency as a human being, and my sense of honor as a soldier. I'd learned early about the necessity of treating prisoners humanely. My father, Tomas B. Taguba, a member of the joint American-Filipino force during World War II, was captured by the Japanese and endured the Bataan Death March.

It was clear to me in 2004 that the United States military could not be the institution it needed to be as long as it engaged in and tolerated abuse.

But the military's path to accountability was a long one, and its leaders hardly welcomed oversight. A few months after I completed the investigation, I was reassigned to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, where I could be closely monitored. Then, in early 2006, I received a telephone call from Gen. Richard A. Cody, then the Army's vice chief of staff, who said, ""I need you to retire by January of 2007."" No explanation was given. But none was needed.

I remain certain that by investigating inhumane treatment of detainees, I did my duty as a soldier, and that my inquiry -- along with one in 2008 by the Senate Armed Services Committee -- made the military a stronger, more trustworthy institution. As a result, interrogation and detention regulations were reformed and training programs were revised to comply with the Geneva Conventions.

Equally important, the military changed its command structures for detainee operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And while accountability for the architects of the torture has proved elusive, more than 200 members of the armed forces have been punished for their involvement in abuse.

Ultimately, as we learned with Abu Ghraib, the best way of guarding against torture is an American public well informed about the moral and strategic costs of such abuse. In the absence of an open accounting, polls show that support for torture among Americans has increased over recent years as proponents sow doubt about whether abusive interrogation is, in fact, illegitimate. So I am very concerned by the pre-emptive efforts of the C.I.A. to derail what we know to be strong criticism of the agency's conduct during the ""war on terror.""

Agency officials, past and current, surely believe that by seeking to undermine the credibility of the report, they are acting in the best interests of the agency. But when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, has accused you of spying, you may want to reconsider your P.R. strategy. Yet we learn that the former C.I.A. director George J. Tenet, who presided over the ""enhanced interrogation"" program and later claimed that ""We don't torture people,"" is working with the current director, John O. Brennan, to shape the agency's response to the report.

One of President Obama's greatest actions as president and commander in chief came on his second full day in office, when he signed an executive order banning torture. But he has allowed the C.I.A. to oversee the redaction process of this report, and is now apparently allowing Mr. Tenet to run a publicity campaign against it. The president should make sure that Mr. Brennan -- who is, after all, his employee -- spurns Mr. Tenet and accepts oversight.

"Jones, James",2007,1,2014-08-14,0,0,0,WSJ,Marine Corps,,,M,How to Save Iraq and Honor American Sacrifice,The crisis in Iraq is several orders of magnitude worse than those we faced in 1991 or at any time since the 2003 invasion. The U.S. -- and our allies in Europe and the Middle East -- must help Prime Minister-designate Abadi save Iraq. The consequences of failure are too great to opt out.,"The disaster in Iraq has deepened and crystallized over the past 10 days. Terrorist forces of the Islamic State of
Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS, seized the Mosul Dam, the country's largest and most important source of
hydroelectric power, and overran several more cities in northern Iraq, including Sinjar. ISIS pushed back the
Kurdish Peshmerga forces, exposing the gravity of one more corrupt decision by Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki—his egregious failure to arm the Kurds so they could at least defend themselves.
We now see how unwise the U.S. policy was to trust Mr. Maliki, who resigned Thursday after eight years of
misrule. But that should have come as no surprise. Middle East leaders warned us that Mr. Maliki's rank
sectarianism and close ties to Tehran could divide Iraq and draw the country into a catastrophe.
Mr. Maliki's failure to unify Iraq's diverse populations is the chief cause of the current crisis, but Washington bears
some blame for not taking timely action that could have limited this summer's chaos. The Obama administration
could have maintained a limited military training presence in Iraq after 2011; could have acted in Syria last year
when the chemical weapons ""red line"" was crossed; and could have insisted that Mr. Maliki arm the Kurds. But
what matters more is what the U.S. can do now.
ISIS's seizure of Sinjar aggravated an already desperate refugee crisis in northern Iraq, forcing tens of thousands
of members of the Yazidi religious sect to flee persecution and death. This latest in a 60-day spate of
ISIS-inflicted horrors elicited limited military operations by the U.S., with airstrikes under way since last Thursday.
This was a welcome response, and it appears to have eased at least temporarily the Yazidi refugee crisis, but
ISIS is relentless and we should be under no illusions about what might lie ahead.
The terrorists' assault on the Kurdish north is reminiscent of the conditions that led to Operation Provide Comfort
in northern Iraq in 1991, a U.S.-led, NATO-supported humanitarian mission that saved hundreds of thousands of
Kurdish refugees from attacks by Saddam Hussein. The effort ultimately required an engagement of five years.
President Obama recently said that current U.S. operations in Iraq could ""take a while,"" and he is right. But there
are lessons from Operation Provide Comfort that can be applied immediately.
These lessons teach that more must be done—quickly and multilaterally—to save Iraq from a division that could
legitimize a terrorist state in the heart of the Middle East. If Iraq is to survive intact, it must do the following:
First, Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi must rapidly form a new government. He is a well-respected
member of Iraq's Parliament, having served since 2005. Mr. Abadi should create an inclusive ruling coalition,
appoint a new and diverse cabinet, and appoint effective ministers of defense and the interior, which Mr. Maliki
failed to do.
Second, Mr. Abadi must restore relations between Baghdad and Iraq's Kurdish and Sunni populations. Without
unity of command and effort, the fight against ISIS will fail. Repairing Mr. Maliki's breaches may require strategic
concessions such as allowing the Kurds to keep Kirkuk and permitting the Sunnis to form their own region under
the constitution.
Third, Iraq must promptly implement, with U.S. and international support, a robust and coherent battle strategy to
destroy ISIS. The main elements of America's contribution should include:
Page 70 of 80 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
• Robust support to and expansion of humanitarian missions, and arming the Kurds directly with sufficient
weaponry to ensure that they can defend their region.
• Immediate and greatly expanded aid and assistance to the new Iraqi government.
• A special envoy to ensure direct and immediate communications with Baghdad and with Kurdish, Sunni and
Shiite leaders (including tribal sheikhs).
• Intelligence that enables the effective targeting of ISIS command and control.
• Convincing regional leaders that ISIS must be denounced and denied a permanent presence in Iraq.
While we should act multilaterally, we must expand American efforts or risk the continued existence of a terrorist
Islamic State and a permanently Balkanized Iraq. Further action might include an Operation Provide Comfort-like
mission to rescue Iraq's threatened refugees, an acceleration of aid and arms provision to Baghdad and Erbil,
close air support to Iraqi and Kurdish operations, and an aggressive diplomatic initiative to unify the region
against ISIS.
On this last point, the U.S. should offer to be an honest broker at a strategic conference that engages Mr. Abadi
and his new team with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Turkey and our European allies.
Ideally, the conference would produce a joint statement condemning ISIS and agreement on a plan to defeat the
terrorists and restore Iraq's territorial integrity.
But securing the Kurdish north should be an immediate priority. Operation Provide Comfort succeeded in part
because it involved 25,000 troops from several nations. Saddam Hussein's military knew better than to take them
on. The Obama administration should not rule out a similar effort. The U.S. could also remove the absurd and
anachronistic designation of the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan as Tier Three
terrorist organizations. Doing so would be an act of goodwill that would resonate with the beleaguered Kurds.
The crisis in Iraq is several orders of magnitude worse than those we faced in 1991 or at any time since the 2003
invasion. The U.S.—and our allies in Europe and the Middle East—must help Prime Minister-designate Abadi
save Iraq. The consequences of failure are too great to opt out.
For the Iraqi people who hope for peace, for all the U.S. service personnel who made such heroic sacrifices in
Iraq over the past 23 years, and for U.S. national security, this is the right thing to do.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444

While it is important that the president has recognized the growing threat to U.S. security, these limited tactical measures will neither permanently reverse ISIS gains nor address the maelstrom in the Middle East. A combined political, economic and military strategy is needed, and one element without the others will likely doom the effort.","Two months ago we laid out a plan on these pages to bring Iraq back from the abyss of terrorist domination, turn
the tide in the Syria conflict, and crush the advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. The need for such a
plan is now more urgent as ISIS has since advanced dramatically, the Iraqi army and Kurdish militia initially
performed poorly, and the terror group has threatened to kill more Americans as it did James Foley last week.
President Obama has so far ordered some 1,100 troops into Iraq and conducted close to 100 airstrikes. While it is
important that the president has recognized the growing threat to U.S. security, these limited tactical measures
will neither permanently reverse ISIS gains nor address the maelstrom in the Middle East. A combined political,
economic and military strategy is needed, and one element without the others will likely doom the effort.
First, the political challenge: The Islamic State, like its predecessor al Qaeda in Iraq and al Qaeda itself, has its
roots in the swamp of Arab political life. Extremists gain purchase because the region's leaders have delivered so
little to the hundreds of millions over whom they rule. The Obama administration appeared to recognize this
problem when it demanded the ouster of former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who had estranged the
nation's Sunni tribes, leading some to welcome ISIS from Syria.
Regional leaders are aware of these problems and exploit them through proxy wars in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya
and the Palestinian territories. This is a recipe for endless conflict, and those leaders should be forced into a
dialogue to resolve grievances and develop a regional strategy to defeat ISIS, al Qaeda and their ideological
brethren.
Only the United States has the clout to convene such a summit. Only the U.S. can demand real change, and only
the U.S can offer security reassurances to turn the political tide in the Middle East.
In particular, the time has come to confront the government of Qatar, which funds and arms ISIS and other
Islamist terrorist groups such as Hamas. The tiny Gulf potentate has never had to choose between membership
in the civilized world or continuing its sponsorship of regional killers. The U.S. has the most leverage. We have
alternatives to our Combined Air and Operations Center in Doha, the al Udeid air base, other bases and
prepositioned materiel. We should tell Qatar to end its support for terrorism or we leave.
Second, the economic challenge: ISIS may now be the richest terror group in the world. Through hostage taking,
criminality, conquest and outside financial support, ISIS is building a war chest measuring in the hundreds of
millions of dollars. It has portfolio managers, bankers and other accouterments of a proto-Treasury.
These facilitators have not come under pressure in the way the West has challenged al Qaeda and Iran's
bankers. The intelligence is available to exert this pressure, but the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world are
moving at a glacial pace.
Third, the military component: ISIS is at war and wants to control as much territory as possible. Jordan, Kuwait
and Lebanon are in the group's sights. The Islamic State wants to control oil fields, financial and political centers
and create a quasi-state with self-proclaimed emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in charge.
Page 72 of 80 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
President Obama has ""limited"" action to protect American personnel and selected refugees, but even his tactical
air strikes to help reclaim the Mosul Dam and the slow ramp-up of advisers are inadequate to meet the threat. A
military campaign is needed to defeat ISIS, not merely stop or contain it.
Contrary to some claims, this is not a plan for a new American ground war in Iraq seeking to reconstitute a failed
state. It is a mission to help Iraqis and Syrians on the ground help themselves. A U.S.-led international coalition
can provide the military capability, including air interdiction to deny ISIS freedom of movement, take away its
initiative to attack at will in Iraq, and dramatically reduce its sanctuary in Syria.
Political and military leaders must recognize that Iraq and Syria are indivisible in this conflict. The group must be
defeated in both places.
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey has said ISIS cannot be defeated ""without addressing that part of
the organization that resides in Syria."" Like the Kurdish Peshmerga in Iraq, the Free Syrian Army needs heavy
weapons, ammunition and supplies. And Washington is also blocking the delivery of much-needed weapons and
equipment already purchased by the Iraqi military. Arming allies to fight a common enemy cannot be an
afterthought.
U.S. military support will be key: The U.S. Central Command has a list of ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq, including
staging bases for equipment and troops, supply bases, training areas for foreign fighters, command and control
and frontline troop positions. Advisers and trainers are also needed by the thousands, not hundreds, to assist the
Peshmerga, reconstitute the Iraqi army, and assist Sunni tribes now opposing ISIS who must join this fight. Close
air support will also be vital.
Baghdadi and his senior leaders aren't invulnerable, and U.S. special operations forces should be given the
mission to target, kill and capture ISIS leaders. We targeted senior terrorist leaders once in Iraq and still do in
Afghanistan and elsewhere. ISIS should be no different, particularly after its brutal murder of Foley.
None of these steps are sufficient by themselves to defeat a capable, motivated and well-armed terrorist group.
Much will depend on the effectiveness of the combined ground force backed by consistent air power. But failure
means the destabilization of the Middle East, terrible bloodshed and, ultimately, the murder of more Americans. A
comprehensive strategy is the only realistic choice to defeat ISIS, and the time is long past to get serious.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444

As someone who spent 34 years in the military, I have no interest in partisan politics. But informed by my service, I am concerned about a dangerous gap I see in American life: a gap of shared experience, common purpose and gratitude.","This month Americans chose many new leaders, but they continue to have diminished faith in the system in which those leaders serve. Over the past few elections, American politics has produced a succession of dramatic victories and defeats but not a sense of common national purpose. Trust in government is near all-time lows, and social trust - trust in others - is lower among millennials than previous generations. A change in elected leaders has not healed the divisions of our nation, because the problem runs deeper than politics.

The leaders we elect are not succeeding, in part because they reflect us. Just as they have grown less likely to cross the aisle to get things done, we as citizens have become less likely to have a sense of common identity or experience. Turnout for the recent election was the lowest for a midterm in more than 70 years. We are increasingly likely to live among, befriend and work with people with views and backgrounds similar to our own. We have sustained a series of wars for more than 13 years with less than 1 percent of the population serving in the military, creating a gap in experience and understanding between those who serve and those who do not. We lack common experiences that bind us as a people. We have lost our confidence in doing big things as a nation.

Citizenship is like a muscle that can atrophy from too little use; if we want to strengthen it, we need to exercise it. We need to support leaders who ask more of us and not those who simply promise us more. We need candidates who will cross the aisle in support of a big idea for renewed citizenship.

Two years from now, the United States needs to have an election - and a corresponding public campaign - that asks more from us as citizens. As someone who spent 34 years in the military, I have no interest in partisan politics. But informed by my service, I am concerned about a dangerous gap I see in American life: a gap of shared experience, common purpose and gratitude.

So today I'm calling on voters, donors and future candidates to work together to make a ""service year"" a common expectation and opportunity for all 18- to 28-year-old Americans. This would be an American version of universal national service - appropriately voluntary but socially expected. Through such service, young Americans from different income levels, races, ethnicities, political affiliations and religious beliefs could learn to work together to get things done. Such a project should be a defining issue of the 2016 election.

It is no longer enough for our politics to focus on what is comfortable and convenient; that will only encourage further cynicism and division. If we demand what is needed and what is right, we can reshape the political debate. Our country and our citizens have responded to this type of call before - including the generation of military men and women who volunteered after the 9/11 attacks, many of whom I was proud to command. Our nation has never preferred what is easy when it mattered most. Americans have tried, imperfectly at times, to embrace big goals and to make sacrifices on behalf of the future.

Many people already serve, whether in the State Department, in the military, in the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps, as elected officials, as teachers or firefighters, or in an array of other public-service positions. Demand for national service is high, with more than five times as many applications submitted for AmeriCorps positions as there are opportunities.

What we need is a system of national service that goes well beyond anything that exists today. Every young adult should be called to year-long service, whether as a tutor or mentor in one of our country's 2.3 million classrooms, a conservation worker in one of our country's national parks or wilderness areas , an aide to one of the 1.5 million Americans who require hospice care each year or in one of numerous other areas of high unmet need. Such service should provide a moderate stipend to ensure that people from any background could participate, count for some sort of course credit in college and be designed to help make it easier for a service member to get a job.

If candidates ask voters to support this big idea, I know that they will find millions who want to answer the call. Donors who insist their candidates support such an idea will be giving something big back to their country beyond their financial contributions. Voters who support such an idea will be electing candidates who ask them to move beyond an easy citizenship.

Imagine if, during the next election season, candidates at all levels competed to propose serious ideas for the civic transformation of America. Afterward, our newly elected leaders would possess a mandate to converge on a unique patch of common ground. And there is no better common ground than the common experience of serving our country.",10,CivMilBalance,,,,,,,74,113,2013,0.867574265,0.797596873,37.4826371,47.2072444

Following the leaks by Edward Snowden beginning in June last year of highly classified intelligence gathering techniques, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matthew Olsen, disclosed in September that terrorists tracked by U.S. intelligence services have started encrypting their communications in ways that defeat detection, and that the government has lost track of several.

Meanwhile, Islamic State terrorists continue to rampage across Syria and Iraq, even as the group, also known as ISIS, uses sophisticated Internet communications to swell its ranks with recruits bearing U.S., Canadian or European passports who can easily slip back into their native countries and wreak havoc.

In that threat environment, one would think that the last thing on the ""to do"" list of the 113th Congress would be to add to the grim news. Yet Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has announced that he will bring to the floor the extravagantly misnamed USA Freedom Act, a major new bill exquisitely crafted to hobble the gathering of electronic intelligence.

For starters, the bill ends the National Security Agency's bulk collection of what is called telephone metadata. This includes the date, time, duration and telephone numbers for all calls, but not their content or the identity of the caller or called, and is information already held by telephone companies. The bill would substitute a cumbersome and untried process that would require the NSA, when it seeks to check on which telephone numbers have called or been called by a number reasonably associated with terrorist activity, to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA court, and then scurry to each of the nation's telephone-service providers to comb through the information that remains in their hands rather than in the NSA's.

Nothing in the bill requires the telephone companies to preserve the metadata for any prescribed period. Current Federal Communications Commission regulations impose an 18-month retention requirement, but administrative regulations are subject to change. It isn't hard to envision companies that wish to offer subscribers the attraction of rapid destruction of these records, or a complaisant bureaucracy that lets them do it.

The bill's imposition of the warrant requirement on the NSA would be more burdensome than what any assistant U.S. attorney must do to get metadata in a routine criminal case, which is simply to aver that the information is needed in connection with a criminal investigation -- period.

Proponents say this change is necessary to allay fears that the NSA could use telephone metadata to construct an electronic portrait of an American citizen's communications, and determine whether that person has, say, consulted a psychiatrist, or called someone else's spouse. However, only 22 people at the NSA are permitted access to metadata, and only upon a showing of relevance to a national-security investigation, and they are barred from any data-mining whatsoever even in connection with such an investigation. They are overseen by a Madisonian trifecta of the FISA court, the executive and committees of Congress. Those people and everyone else at the NSA live in constant dread of failing to detect a terrorist attack. Nonetheless, the sponsors of the USA Freedom Act prefer the counsel of hypothetical fears to the logic of concrete realities.

This sensitivity to abstract concerns doesn't stop at the water's edge. Under the bill, if the FISA court directs any change, however technical, in the gathering of information from foreigners abroad, no information gathered before the change is implemented could be used before any official body in this country -- agency, grand jury, court, whatever.

Back in the bad old days, as during World War II and the Cold War, intelligence of all sorts directed at protecting national security was gathered by the executive without supervision by judges who, after all, know nothing about the subject and cannot be held to account for adverse outcomes. After the Watergate scandal and the resignation of President Nixon, the FISA court was established in 1978 to provide oversight for intelligence gathering, in addition to that already provided by the executive and by Congress. Now, there are those who complain that the FISA court accedes too often to requests for government access to information, and does not appear to resemble a true court in that there is no public advocate opposing the government position.

But the nearly uniform success of the government before the FISA court is due both to the government's careful restraint in presenting applications, and to pushback from the court itself -- which results in the amendment of applications. Even when the government applies for wiretaps or search warrants in ordinary criminal cases there is no advocate opposing the application.

Nonetheless, this new bill would establish a permanent advocate appointed by the court to oppose the government's applications before the FISA court. This provision has elicited an extraordinary written objection from a former presiding judge of the FISA court. U.S. District Judge John D. Bates points out that the presence of such an advocate, who cannot conceivably be aware of all the facts, would simply add to the burdens of the court and could wind up sacrificing both national security and privacy.

This bill redefines the FISA court, which was never meant to be an adversary tribunal and was imposed simply as an added safeguard in the 1970s, without regard to its history or its purpose. Worse, it is a three-headed constitutional monster: It is a violation of both the separation of powers principle and the Constitution's appointments clause by having judges rather than the president appoint the public advocate, and then it has the advocate litigate against the Justice Department when both executive offices are supposed to be controlled by the president.

The bill is not an unrelieved disaster. It rightly allows for the expansion of metadata gathering to include more calls made by cellphones.

Not surprisingly, the bill has received the endorsement of President Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, and his director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who in a Sept. 2 letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee said they were ""comfortable"" with the bill's provisions -- even as they conceded that the bill may have ""additional impacts that we will be able to identify only after we start to implement the new law.""

If that calls to mind the Affordable Care Act and the suggestion that we should wait and find out what is in the bill until after it passes, bear in mind that ""additional impacts"" here may include holes in the ground where buildings used to stand and empty chairs where people used to sit.

There is no immediate or emergency need for this piece of legislation. Current surveillance authorities do not expire at the end of this year, which is fortunate given the current threats we face at home and abroad. The USA Freedom Act should await the attention of the Congress that will actually oversee it.

"Scales, Robert",2000,1,2015-01-25,,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,"To Stop the Terrorists, Take Away Their Hope","Can the Iraqis do it? If so, can they do it before the Islamic State solidifies its grip on the river cities? One thing is certain: The last best hope for a decisive outcome against the hopefulness of these killers rests with the Iraqi army and the Americans who are trying to turn them into a viable fighting force","The centerpiece of a national security strategy is to isolate and exploit an enemy's vulnerable ""center of gravity."" Carl von Clausewitz, the 19th-century Prussian military philosopher and father of modern military theory, defined center of gravity as ""the source of power that provides moral or physical strength, freedom of action, or will to act.""

Conventional wisdom inside the Pentagon and among defense intellectuals is that the vulnerable center of gravity of today's enemy is its extreme Islamist ideology. Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday"" after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggested that the rise in the terrorists' power has been mainly due to the inspiration that comes from an increasingly radical ideology. Thus, most of the Obama administration's ""nine lines of effort"" to defeat radical Islam are, in fact, non-military actions meant to counter this ideology, such as disrupting the finances of terror groups and disseminating alternative messaging.

But the numerous attacks we have seen around the world suggest that this ideology is not a vulnerable center of gravity, if it ever was. Dedication to an ideological cause does not appear to be in short supply. Likewise, after the Abu Ghraib scandal and 12 years of perceived atrocities against Islam at the Guantanamo Bay prison, the United States long ago lost its ability to effectively fight an ideological war against Islamic terrorism.

Our political masters need to distinguish between ideology and the enemy's true vulnerable center of gravity: hope. The differences are subtle. Hope is the belief that ideology will prevail. Hope drives motivation or, in the psychologist's jargon, a ""response initiation."" To the extent that hope is present, a terrorist will translate belief into action. As hope is removed, even the most ideologically attuned enemy will become passive. As Clausewitz advises: Strike the center of gravity and the enemy loses the will to act.

The history of war suggests hope is a fuel that induces young, post-adolescent men to turn ideology into action. And hope rises with the perception of military success.

Confederate soldiers were given hope of eventual victory after the Union debacle at the First Battle of Bull Run. A similar rise of mindless hope occurred among German youth after the fall of Paris in 1940 and, sadly, within the U.S. Army after the fall of Baghdad in 2003.

Hope extends wars and makes them bloodier through the euphoria that comes with a rush to share in the glory. Hope gives young men surety and confidence. It provides a moral sanctuary and is the glue that binds soldiers together in war. Soldiers - and, by extension, terrorists - simply won't fight if there is no hope.

Arab cultures have a history with the mercurial collapse of hope. The huge swings in hope among Arab forces before and after defeats in the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars and the U.S. victory in the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein's army in 1991 are instructive. The apathy that followed Osama bin Laden's killing also suggests that terrorists can lose hope after the death of a single icon.

Think of hope as a material formed in a crucible over time by a series of successful terrorist strikes against the West and Western-affiliated countries in the Middle East. Since violent actions filled this crucible, only a violent military counterresponse can crack the crucible and empty it of hope. The object of a campaign against hope is not necessarily to kill in large numbers but rather to find the greatest vulnerability and shatter it dramatically and decisively.

The terrorist's greatest source of hope today comes from Islamic State battlefield successes in Syria and Iraq. A defeat there cracks the crucible. The question is how to do it with enough drama and speed that terrorists the world over lose hope and become passive. From any perspective, the Islamic State enclave in Syria is militarily unassailable. But Iraq is a different story.

A campaign against hope must start from Baghdad and move northward up the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The Islamic State's vulnerability rests with its disconnected garrisons spotted astride the rivers like a string of pearls. Thanks to U.S. bombing, Islamic State fighters cannot easily move among these enclaves. Thus, a sequence of patient ground assaults against garrisons in cities such as Taji, Hit, Tal Afar and eventually Mosul will create momentum sufficient to push the Islamic State's forces to the Syrian border. These won't be victories so much as public humiliations, the antidote to hope.

Can the Iraqis do it? If so, can they do it before the Islamic State solidifies its grip on the river cities? One thing is certain: The last best hope for a decisive outcome against the hopefulness of these killers rests with the Iraqi army and the Americans who are trying to turn them into a viable fighting force.",8,Warfighting,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444

The Air Force Academy would send me and other reviewers all of the Indiana applications, which we would narrow to 20, with top SAT and ACT scores and perfect or near-perfect GPAs. Documented examples of leadership were required. After personal interviews, we then would select 10 finalists, forwarding these to the academy, which often made further cuts. These bright individuals were not, as Mr. Beauchamp contended, low-quality students.

l

Scott Beauchamp's fine commentary cited several arguments for doing away with the service academies. He questioned the selection process for each academy. While, as he pointed out, there are no data to show how students are admitted, the academies have one-year prep schools to help prepare some students. Taxpayers foot at least part of that bill, too.

l

Let me offer a contrasting view to Scott Beauchamp's, based on my background as an Air Force Academy cadet and instructor and commander of the Air Force ROTC detachment at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I have seen brilliant officers who were academy graduates and brilliant officers who graduated from ROTC; likewise, I have seen incompetent officers from both commissioning sources. Yet both the academies and ROTC are vital to strengthen the U.S. military, because both foster intellect and insight based on fundamentally different undergraduate experiences.

My assessment of the value of the Air Force Academy comes also from data collected from my 1977 classmates, 30 years after our graduation. Most of us are no longer in uniform.

"Petraeus, David and O'Hanlon, Michael",2011,1,2015-02-01,,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,The Next American Century,"Indeed, however our nation's political parties differ on a variety of issues, Democrats and Republicans should agree on one proposition: This is another American century, and the future has seldom looked brighter. Washington policymakers do not need to rescue the nation from the precipice so much as to make reasonable, mid-size compromises on a number of policies and otherwise get out of the way.","Short-term economic trends in the United States are encouraging. Unemployment is down, growth is up, deficits are less than half what they were during the ""Great Recession,"" gas prices have plummeted, citizens have ""deleveraged"" their debt considerably and consumer sentiment is very positive.

For many, however, these realities are merely a soothing veneer over a troubled picture. They see America in decline, the middle class adrift, the world in shambles and political acrimony more entrenched than ever over issues ranging from immigration and U.S. policy on Iran and Cuba to taxes and health care. This pessimism is not limited to the home front. With major U.S. allies in Europe and East Asia enduring sustained economic malaise, worrisome demographics and declining power, many believe the Western world is in retreat.

Those sentiments are generally unfounded, however, when it comes to the United States and North America. Recent positive headlines have not masked deeper problems so much as they have heralded the kind of future this nation can enjoy - especially if political leaders can make a few sensible, non- Herculean compromises on issues that beg attention.

The United States is, in fact, better positioned than any other country for the next 20 to 30 years - and, very likely, beyond. Together with Canada and Mexico, the United States also enjoys mutually reinforcing sources of competitive advantages in geopolitics, demographics, energy and natural resources, manufacturing and industrial competitiveness and, above all, innovation and technology. If the 20th century was the American Century, the 21st is poised to be the North American Century.

Since we first offered this view some two years ago in The Post, a number of favorable trends have solidified or even accelerated:

* The United States is now the world's largest producer of both oil liquids and natural gas, with Canada and Mexico important players in the energy arena, as well.

* U.S. manufacturing, while still far from its heyday, has added hundreds of thousands of jobs over the past two years, and Mexico is now fully competitive with China and other Asian manufacturing hubs in a variety of industries.

* The United States leads the world in high-tech sectors such as aerospace and pharmaceuticals.

* The U.S. federal budget deficit, while still too high, is below 3 percent of gross domestic product, and publicly held debt as a fraction of the GDP has stabilized at around 75 percent.

* Relative to GDP, U.S. household debt is down significantly from pre-Great Recession levels.

* U.S. small business confidence is the highest it has been in nine years, and consumer confidence is at its highest in 11 years.

* Crime rates in America are the lowest in a generation.

* America's demographics are far and away the healthiest among the developed economies, as well as Russia, China and India, with a nice and steady 1 percent annual population growth rate.

* The U.S. military, while under budgetary strain and still in harm's way, has weathered not only the brunt of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but also the ax of ""sequestration"" and downward pressure on budgets for half a decade.

* The United States and Germany are, according to the World Economic Forum, neck and neck in respective claims to be the world's most competitive major economy. U.S. strengths in market size, entrepreneurial culture and financial networks roughly equal Germany's strengths in modern manufacturing and social cohesion.

* U.S. GDP growth is now exceeding 3 percent. Indeed, at present it appears that the U.S. economy may, for the first time in some nine years, grow more in absolute dollar terms than China's does. (China's growth rate, though declining, is likely to be nearly twice as fast; however, as measured in classic terms, its GDP is still only a bit over half as large as our own.)

This last point is crucial. China has recorded historic achievements, but its ascent to superpowerdom is not a given. Leaving aside the limited appeal of China's political and economic model, it faces the imperatives of transitioning from a low-cost labor provider to a value-added and services economy, reducing the world's largest debt-to-GDP ratio, cutting pollution and corruption, dealing with insufficiently competitive state-owned enterprises and addressing numerous other domestic challenges. In fact, Brookings Institution scholar David Dollar has argued that, even if China overtakes the United States in absolute GDP within a couple of decades, the United States may regain the top spot later in the century, especially if China's political model remains autocratic.

There is, of course, much that the United States needs to do. We need comprehensive immigration reform. Our education system is highly uneven in quality and requires an overhaul to prepare students for the economy of the future. Our lower and middle economic classes have seen minimal real wage growth since the Great Recession. Crime is still high by Western standards. And the U.S. deficit will get worse again within a half-decade or so if nothing is done on entitlement spending and tax reform. Beyond that, our infrastructure - which is central to future productivity gains - needs major improvement. And, of course, climate changes remain a threat, as do Islamic extremist groups and Iran, as well as Russia.

Regardless, more than any nation on Earth, and arguably more than any in history, the United States has the assets needed to confront its problems head-on. Indeed, however our nation's political parties differ on a variety of issues, Democrats and Republicans should agree on one proposition: This is another American century, and the future has seldom looked brighter.

"Stone, Douglas and Atran, Scott",2008,1,2015-03-16,,0,0,NYT,Marine Corps,,,M,The Kurds' Heroic Stand Against ISIS,"The United States must help the Kurds translate their bravery into a true ability to defeat the Islamic State. They are America's most reliable friends on the ground, and should be treated as such.","THE Islamic State continues to control a huge section of Syria. But in Iraq, its advance has stalled. While Shiite militias and their Iranian allies fight the Islamic State ferociously, the Kurds have held a 640-mile front against the Islamic State's advance. Their steadfastness should prompt America to rethink its alliances and interests in the region and to deepen its relationship with the Kurds -- who are sometimes described as the world's largest stateless nation.

Last week, the Sunni town of Tikrit (Saddam Hussein's hometown) fell to largely Shiite forces from Iraq, backed by Iran. An offensive to retake Mosul, Iraq's second largest city and the heart of Arab Sunni nationalism, is now within reach. The Kurds plan to enter eastern Mosul, where many Kurds lived before the Islamic State seized the city in June, but they say that moderate Arab Sunnis must lead the effort to retake the rest of the city -- not Baghdad's predominantly Shiite forces or the Iranian-backed Shiite militias. The Kurds point out that it was grievances against Shiite rule that helped drive Sunni support for the Islamic State in the first place.

Together with Lydia Wilson and Hoshang Waziri, our colleagues at Artis, a nonprofit group that uses social science research to resolve intergroup violence, we found that the Kurds demonstrate a will to fight that matches the Islamic State's. The United States needs to help them win.

In Kirkuk last week, where only a narrow canal separates Kurdish and Islamic State forces, we talked to three captured Islamic State fighters, and to their captors: Gen. Sarhad Qadir, the city's Kurdish police chief, and his deputy, Col. Gazi Ali Rashid.

General Qadir, who lost a brother in earlier fighting, has been wounded 14 times in battles with Sunni militants, most recently in a suicide attack on Tuesday. The Islamic State recently paraded Colonel Rashid's brother in a cage, along with other Kurds captured in a large-scale offensive that stalled in late January. Arab Sunni tribes have been trying to negotiate a prisoner exchange to signal to the Kurds that they are not all aligned with the Islamic State, but Colonel Rashid has no hope. ""I know my brother will die,"" he told us shortly before he was severely wounded on Tuesday.

The Islamic State prisoners most likely will be executed for having committed assassinations and deadly car bombings. The three are in their early 20s; two have wives and young children. None finished elementary school. They recounted growing up in the failed Iraqi state during the last decade: a hellish world of guerrilla war, disrupted families, constant fear and utter lack of hope. They see Iran and the Shiites as their greatest enemy but they also believe that America allowed them to oppress the Arab Sunni minority for the sake of majority rule.

When we asked the prisoners ""What is Islam?"" they answered ""my life."" Yet it was clear that they knew little about the Quran, or Islamic history, other than what they'd heard from Al Qaeda and Islamic State propaganda. For them, the cause of religion is fused with the vision of a caliphate -- a joining of political and religious rule -- that kills or subjugates any nonbeliever.

The Kurds' commitment to Islam is matched by their commitment to national identity; theirs is a more open-minded version of Islam. They have defended Yazidis and Christians, as well as Arab Sunnis, who make up the bulk of the more than one million displaced persons in Iraqi Kurdistan.

But perhaps what most reveals commitment by the Kurds is how they hold the line with so little material assistance.

On the night of Jan. 30, the Islamic State used the cover of fog to attack a Kurdish battalion near the town of Mahmour. Seven Kurds were killed immediately. Their colleagues said that if they had had night-vision goggles -- or better yet, thermal-imaging scopes to also detect vehicles -- all would most likely be alive. When we gave them a gift of our small, store-bought binoculars with which we had been watching Islamic State movements less than one mile away, they expressed deep gratitude. As we left, a mine went off as they moved earth to make a defensive wall, for there is no demining equipment.

To be sure, coalition airstrikes have prevented Islamic State forces from deploying heavy artillery to break Kurdish lines, although Gen. Sirwan Barzani, who commands the main front between Erbil and Mosul, told us that a Pentagon lawyer must approve every strike (a policy intended to minimize chances of civilian casualties from drone attacks). Sometimes, that approval comes too late.

With its big guns vulnerable to air attack, the Islamic State adapts its tactics, piercing Kurdish lines with suicide attacks in primitively armored vehicles. One Kurdish commando near the Mosul Dam showed us, on his smartphone, a video of the approach of a steel-hardened vehicle. No amount of rifle fire or rocket-propelled grenades could stop the attack, which killed 23 and wounded 40.

Yet the United States insists that the Kurds obtain permission, grudging and often denied, from the central government in Baghdad for essential equipment to counter these and better weapons that the Islamic State seized from the Syrian and Iraqi Armies.

Meanwhile, the Islamic State won't quit. Their wounded fighters often booby trap their bodies rather than be captured, and face down fire to recover dead comrades' bodies. The leaders they call emirs, who are chosen because of their religious devotion and fearless effectiveness, and their foreign fighters, are especially fierce. The Westerners often die in suicide attacks; seasoned fighters from North Africa and the Middle East, and particularly from former parts of the Soviet Union (like Chechnya, Uzbekistan, Dagestan), are prominent as operational leaders and snipers. Foreign fighters return to their countries only if they escape or are sent home, because the punishment for defection is death.

Local Syrians and Iraqis conscripted to fight for the Islamic State, in contrast, are not totally committed. In one conversation picked up by a Kurdish walkie-talkie, a fighter with a local accent asked for help: ""My brother has been killed. I am surrounded. Help me take his body away."" The reply: ""Perfect, you will join him soon in Paradise."" The fighter retorted: ""Come for me. This Paradise, I don't want.""

The Islamic State will say to a local sheikh: ""Give us 20 young men or we loot your village."" To a father with three sons, they will say: ""Give us one or we take your daughter as a bride for our men."" One girl of 15 told how she was ""married"" and ""divorced"" 15 times in a single night to a troop of Islamic State fighters (under some readings of Shariah law, ""divorce"" is as easy as repeating ""I divorce you"" three times, which makes it easy to cast rape as marriage). In the face of such brutality, wavering supporters of the Islamic State could well rally to an Arab Sunni force allied with the Kurds. That is a prospect the United States, which fears leaving the fight mainly to Iran and its allies, should welcome.

As we said goodbye at the front, a young Kurdish sniper promised us she would never abandon her comrades or their cause. Will the United States deny her people the means to counter the Islamic State -- for the sake of upholding the costly illusion of an Iraqi nation-state, devised from three Ottoman provinces to fit British imperial desires but now hopelessly fragmented?

Kurdish leaders say they would accept a federated Iraqi state if they were given autonomy in political, economic and security matters. The United States should have agreed to do this long ago; it's not too late to do so now. If America does not, Iraqi Kurdistan will most likely declare itself an independent state, which Turkey, Iran and Syria will move forcefully to stop, for fear that their own Kurdish populations will try to join it.

The United States must help the Kurds translate their bravery into a true ability to defeat the Islamic State. They are America's most reliable friends on the ground, and should be treated as such.",8,Warfighting,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Hayden, Michael and Heinonen, Olli and Takeyh, Ray",2008,0,2015-03-23,,0,0,WaPO,Air Force,,,M,A Time Bomb on Iran,"With stakes so high, we need a national debate about the nature and parameters of  of any agreement. The right venue for that debate is in the halls of Congress. No agreement can be considered viable or enduring without such legislative approbation.","As negotiations between Iran and the great powers press forward, Secretary of State John F. Kerry seems to have settled on this defense of any agreement: The terms will leave Iran at least a year away from obtaining a nuclear bomb, thus giving the world plenty of time to react to infractions. The argument is meant to reassure, particularly when a sizable enrichment capacity and a sunset clause appear to have already been conceded. A careful assessment, however, reveals that a one-year breakout time may not be sufficient to detect and reverse Iranian violations.

Once the United States had an indication that Iran was violating an agreement, a bureaucratic process would be necessary to validate the information. It could be months before the director of national intelligence would be confident enough to present a case for action to the president. Several U.S. intelligence agencies, the Energy Department and national nuclear laboratories would need a chance to sniff the data to be convinced that a technical breach had occurred. Only after this methodical review was finished could the director go to the White House with conclusions and recommendations.

Given that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be the on-site inspection organization responsible for the verification of an agreement, the United States' scoop would have to be forwarded to that body. Of course, both the speed and the extent of U.S. sharing would be affected by the need to protect sensitive human or technical sources of information. Only then would IAEA representatives begin talking with their Iranian counterparts about gaining access to disputed sites or activities. History suggests the Iranians would engage in protracted negotiations and much arcane questioning of the evidence. Iran could eventually offer some access while holding back key data and personnel. It would be only after tortured discussions that the IAEA could proclaim itself dissatisfied with Iran's reaction. This process also could take months.

Should the indication of infractions originate with the IAEA, the United States would likewise want to validate the findings itself, which would also be time-consuming.

Once the IAEA arrived at a verdict of noncompliance, it would forward its grievances to the U.N. Security Council for adjudication. The United States would have to convince the other member states invested in the agreement -- including veto-wielding Russia and China -- that the accord was being violated and that forceful action was needed. Time would be spent quarrelling over divergent views, with several outcomes possible, including a Security Council presidential statement or a resolution whose content would need to be agreed upon. And only then could new economic sanctions be imposed on Iran. So, add at least a few more months.

Could sanctions really make a meaningful impact on Iran in whatever time, if any, remained in a one-year scenario? Any sanctions would take time to stress Iran's economy, particularly in the aftermath of an agreement that paved the way for the return of trade and investment. Of course, the United States would not have to wait for the economic pressure to work and could use force against Iran without U.N. endorsement. However, since the advent of nuclear weapons, the United States has negotiated arms-control agreements with an entire spectrum of adversaries and has never used force in response to violations.

And the reality is that any cheating by Iran would always be incremental and never egregious. Throughout the duration of an agreement, there would be occasional reports of Iran enriching to unacceptably high levels and revelations of unreported nuclear installations and experimentation in weapon designs. Iran's habit of lulling the world with a cascade of small infractions is an ingenious way to advance its program without provoking a crisis. In the end, a year simply may not be enough time to build an international consensus on measures to redress Iranian violations.

In the midst of all the typical Washington political cacophony about the progress of the negotiations, what is lost is that an accord between the United States and Iran would be the most consequential arms-control agreement of the post-Cold War period. It would determine the level of stability in the Middle East and impact global nuclear nonproliferation norms. With stakes so high, we need a national debate about the nature and parameters of any agreement. The right venue for that debate is the halls of Congress.

The United States and its vaunted air power were not invited to the party. From the start, many observers assumed the success of the operation was a given, with news coverage focused less on whether Tikrit would fall and more on how victorious Shiite fighters would treat the city's Sunni population.

But a funny thing happened on the way to this Iranian-led walkover. Tikrit still hasn't fallen. Coffins carrying the bodies of Shiite militia members are being sent home in unexpected numbers, and regular Iraqi soldiers are showing a reluctance to fight in urban terrain against the tough light infantry of the Islamic State. That has surprised no one who worked and fought with the Iraqis in the past.

Urban warfare is not a business for amateurs. Even seasoned soldiers can flounder in urban canyons, as the United States learned in Hue City in Vietnam and Mogadishu in Somalia. The Russians were humiliated in Grozny during the Chechen conflict.

The ill-disciplined Shiite mobs trying to retake Tikrit are getting the lesson in urban combat that the U.S. Marine Corps learned through the urban experimentation training we developed from 1994 to 2000. This project allowed our guys to come by their skills the relatively easy way - through the use of laser tag and simulated munitions - before they had to do it for real in Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi. Unfortunately for the Iraqis, some of the Islamic State fighters now defending Tikrit are also veterans of those earlier Iraqi urban fights.

For years after the battle of Hue City in 1968, U.S. military planners emphasized avoiding urban combat by bypassing cities. But following the disastrous 1993 battle in Mogadishu, retired Marine Maj. Gen. Mike Myatt argued that changing world demographics and other factors dictated that urban battles would increasingly become the norm, not the exception. This spurred the Marine Corps to conduct a series of urban warfare experiments designed to improve our tactics and technological approach to urban combat.

I was one of the leaders in this experimentation, and our first experiences were humbling. After one experiment, I told a reporter flatly: ""We suck at this."" But gradually we got better, and all the effort would pay off tremendously in the 2004 battles against al-Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor of the Islamic State, in Fallujah and Ramadi. We spent millions preparing for the urban fights we knew were coming; although the battles were costly, our professionalism and training won out.

Along the way, we found that well-trained combined-arms units consisting of armored vehicles, snipers and precision close air support could surgically suppress urban defenders without destroying the whole city in the process. We developed technologies that can eliminate fighters in one room without destroying the surrounding structure. Ramadi and Fallujah were still bloody affairs, but they were much less costly than they could have been. Our early training engagements resulted in simulated Marine casualties of upward of 70 percent; the actual casualty rate was less than 10 percent.

In Tikrit, by contrast, the Shiite-led mobs masquerading as Iraqi security forces are deep into the process of destroying the city in order to save it, as they employ a strategy of unleashing massive artillery barrages and airstrikes followed by amateurish frontal attacks. The experienced defenders they are trying to dislodge station snipers in the rubble and litter the battlefield with improvised explosives. This is the Battle of Stalingrad in miniature, and the Iraqi government will face more than a dozen more such challenges if it hopes to clear the country of the jihadists. The question will be whether it runs out of will before it runs out of fanatical Shiite militiamen.

Anyone who has seen both real and simulated urban combat knows that only experienced, well-trained troops will be able to oust the Islamic State from the Iraqi and Syrian cities it has infested. This is the hard truth: U.S.-trained Iraqi troops and Syrian rebels may be able to hold those cities once they are cleared, but only Americans are capable of defeating the Islamic State in close urban combat.",6,Warfighting,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Davis, Morris",,1,2015-03-28,,0,0,NYT,Air Force,,,M,Guantanomo's Charade of Justice,We need to set politics aside and end this litany of failure [at Guantanamo]. We have competent and credible federal courts that can provide justice - and finally a measure of closure for the thousands of our fellow citizens who have had to wait far too long. ,"LAST week, we learned that, only months into the job, the official in charge of the military courts system at Guantánamo Bay was stepping down, after judges ruled he had interfered in proceedings. The appointment of an interim replacement was the sixth change of leadership for the tribunals since 2003.

This is yet another setback for the military commissions, as they tackle two of their highest-profile cases: the joint trial of the chief planner of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and four alleged co-conspirators, and the trial of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, accused in the bombing of the American destroyer Cole.

That's not all. Besides the revolving door at the convening authority's office, six military attorneys have served as chief prosecutor for these courts over the same period. (I was the third.)

Think about that for a moment. If a professional football team was on its seventh head coach and sixth quarterback in less than a dozen years, that team would almost certainly be a loser.

On Dec. 31, 2001, the venerable Washington lawyer Lloyd N. Cutler wrote an article in The Wall Street Journal titled ""Lessons on Tribunals -- From 1942."" Mr. Cutler, a young attorney at the Justice Department in the summer of 1942, served on the team that prosecuted the eight German saboteurs whom President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered tried before a military commission following their capture on American soil.

While Mr. Cutler noted some shortcomings in the way the military commission had been conducted in 1942 and advised the Bush administration to avoid repeating those mistakes at Guantánamo Bay, he was generally optimistic that after a six-decade respite military commissions could be revived and used in a credible manner.

""But success will depend on the quality of the judges, the prosecutors and the defense lawyers, and their ability to show the world that justice is in fact being done,"" he concluded. ""In a very real sense, it is the American legal system, not just Al Qaeda's leaders, that would be on trial.""

So how have Guantánamo's tribunals performed, more than 13 years on?

Just six detainees have been both convicted and sentenced for war crimes in military commissions since President George W. Bush first authorized them in November 2001.

Charges against three were later dismissed, and five who were convicted were eventually transferred from Guantánamo. Thus we have a legal system where it is more advantageous to be found guilty of a war crime than never to be charged at all and remain imprisoned indefinitely.

About 85 percent of the 779 men ever held at Guantánamo are no longer there. Most left during the Bush administration. While the number of transfers has been much smaller under the Obama administration, the pace accelerated in the latter part of 2014.

Of the 122 men detained, nearly half have been cleared for transfer by unanimous votes of military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic officials who determined that the detainees could not be prosecuted, posed no identifiable threat to the United States and did not need to remain in our custody. Nevertheless, 56 men cleared to leave still remain, at a cost of about $3 million a year per detainee.

As unfortunate as this waste of resources and damage to America's reputation are, the greatest tragedy is the pain inflicted on the friends and families of the 9/11 and Cole victims. For them, justice has been endlessly delayed.

Rather than showing ""the world that justice is in fact being done,"" as Mr. Cutler wrote, Guantánamo has come to symbolize torture and indefinite detention, and its court system has been discredited as an opaque and dysfunctional process. The latest reshuffle of personnel will not alter this impression.

In November 2013, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. admitted that, had the administration not given up on its plan to try the 9/11 case in federal court, Mr. Mohammed and his colleagues ""would be on death row as we speak."" Mr. Holder blamed partisan politics for the revival of the military commissions.

In the 16 months since, those observations have received further validation. While Osama bin Laden's son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith and the radical cleric Mostafa Kamel Mostafa, also known as Abu Hamza al-Masri, were convicted and sentenced to life in prison by federal courts, the tribunals at Guantánamo stumbled from one mishap to another.

We have competent and credible federal courts that can provide justice -- and finally a measure of closure for the thousands of our fellow citizens who have had to wait far too long.",6,Warfighting,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2015-04-03,,0,0,WaPO,Air Force,,,M,Getting Past the Zero-Sum Game Online,Today's issues give the United States a chance to demonstrate to the world that its tough and powerful intelligence services understand what is at stake and intend to join the public discussion on how to balance the truly important privacy and security questions before us.....,"As director of the National Security Agency and then the Central Intelligence Agency after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, I fought to provide our intelligence officers with every possible advantage in their work to detect and confront threats from our enemies.

We were entering a new kind of conflict. I had grown to professional maturity in an era in which it was NATO vs. the Soviet Union, and our enemy - with its tank divisions in Eastern Europe and intercontinental ballistic missile silos in our sights - was easy to find, though hard to defeat. Today, our enemies are relatively easy to defeat, but they often are damnably difficult to find. Hence the need to create timely, actionable - even exquisite - intelligence.

In our efforts, the genius and innovation of American business has been essential. The United States enjoys a number of advantages, such as world-class information-technology companies, a mastery of the challenges and opportunities of big data and the reality that much of the world's Internet traffic is serviced by U.S. companies. These things have truly made a difference, but sometimes less can be more. Here a little bit of history might be instructive.

In the late 20th century, many viewed the world as a zero-sum game. Any U.S. loss of competitive advantage was our adversary's gain, and our security, the argument went, was correspondingly weakened as well.

Then, a key technology battleground was a measure of raw computing power known as ""MTOPS"" - or millions of theoretical operations per second. Successive administrations tried to protect this assumed U.S. security advantage by blocking exports of computers above a certain MTOPS limit to any but our closest allies. The NSA was always an important player in this discussion. After all, in the business of making and breaking codes, advantages in computing power were often decisive. The export barrier was seen as the NSA's friend.

By the time I became NSA director in the late 1990s, however, the calculation was no longer that simple. We still wanted an MTOPS advantage, of course, but we were fast realizing that our preferred limits were undermining the global competitiveness of the U.S. computer industry - the very industry on which we relied for our success. It was becoming clear that the overall health of that industry was more important than any MTOPS advantage against a specific target country. We still insisted on limits with regard to places such as Cuba and North Korea, but we became far more forgiving elsewhere.

This, of course, had a powerful, positive commercial impact, but the NSA didn't flip its position for commercial reasons. We did it for security reasons. On balance, this change made us stronger, not weaker, over the long haul, since retarding exports would inevitably retard the technological progress that was both our economic and our security lifeblood.

That early lesson has caused me to continue to challenge arguments that technological protectionism furthers national security. It might, but then again, it could have the opposite effect if it freezes development, alienates allies, feeds distrust or invites the creation of similar barriers abroad. I would recommend these broader considerations to those in the U.S. security enterprise with responsibility for evaluating these trade-offs today.

In a perverse way, as the saying goes, what goes around comes around. Precedents we set will be followed - or exploited - by others in an economic system that becomes more globalized and hence more interdependent by the day. Already others point to U.S. activities to justify their own, often nefarious, efforts. Witness the Chinese trying to create moral and legal equivalency between legitimate U.S. intelligence and their massive theft of intellectual property, or their placement of newly minted restrictions on U.S. IT firms. One wonders what the Russias and Chinas of the world will demand if U.S.-based firms are forbidden to create encryption schemes inaccessible to themselves or the government. Beyond the realm of speculation, the Chinese company Alibaba has announced plans to open a cloud data center in the United States. How will we feel when a Chinese court orders Alibaba to send data on Americans back to China, citing our own behavior as justification?

These are serious, long-term questions requiring serious, strategic answers. Possible second- and third-order effects - such as generating a stampede toward data localization or a Balkanized Internet - need to be considered alongside a still- important calculus based on more transient, tactical advantage.

U.S. intelligence was given a black eye, unfairly for the most part, by l'Affaire Snowden. It has conducted its business honorably, with restraint and oversight - perhaps more than any other country. But that has been little noted.

Today's issues give the United States a chance to demonstrate to the world that its tough and powerful intelligence services understand what is at stake and intend to join the public discussion on how to balance the truly important privacy and security questions before us and, more important, take meaningful steps to make us stronger.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Cartwright, James and Dvorkin, Vladimir",2011,1,2015-04-20,,0,0,NYT,Marine Corps,,1,M,How to Avert a Nuclear War,"In periods of heightened tensions and reduced decision times, the likelihood of human and technical error in control systems increases. Launch-on-warning is a relic of Cold War strategy whose risk today far exceeds its value. Our leaders urgently need to talk and, we hope, agree to scrap this obsolete protocol before a devastating error occurs.","WHEN American troops find themselves fighting for their lives, there is no better sound than an A-10, a plane officially nicknamed the Thunderbolt II but known affectionately by the troops as the Warthog, firing its enormous 30-millimeter gun at the enemy. It might not be pretty, but the A-10 is our most capable close air-support aircraft, and its arrival on the battlefield signals survival for our troops and annihilation for our enemies.

Yet over the last two years, the Obama administration and the Air Force leadership have been working overtime to mothball our entire A-10 fleet, 13 years ahead of schedule. They claim that other, newer planes can do the same job, that it's too slow and vulnerable and that it's too expensive.

I appreciate the budget pressures that the Pentagon faces these days. But those arguments have serious flaws -- and if we retire the A-10 before a replacement is developed, American troops will die.

Before running for office, I was an A-10 squadron commander with 325 combat hours. During my time in uniform and since coming to the House and taking up the fight to keep the plane, I have heard countless stories from American soldiers about how the A-10 saved their lives.

In 2008, Marine Master Sgt. Richard Wells and his team were on patrol in Afghanistan when they were ambushed. ""It was the first time in my life that I thought to myself, 'This is it, we're going to die, we're not going to make it out of this,' "" he recalled in a recent interview.

The Marines were severely outnumbered, cornered, and in close combat with dozens of insurgents. Because of the poor weather, fast-moving fighters above the clouds were unable to identify the targets or get close enough to engage. Soon two Marines were seriously wounded, and the enemy was 50 feet away.

Suddenly two A-10s descended below a heavy layer of clouds. The planes are extremely maneuverable and designed to fly close to the ground. Coming within 400 feet of the mountains, they made nearly a dozen gun passes each, giving Sergeant Wells's team cover to run to safety. Without the A-10 and the exceptional training and bravery of its pilots, six Marines would have died that day.

True, other planes and drones can do close air support. But every close-air-support scenario is different, and every platform brings strengths and weaknesses to the fight. The A-10 has unique strengths for the most complex and dangerous such missions.

It can loiter over the battlefield for long periods without refueling. It can maneuver in difficult terrain at low altitudes, fly slowly enough to visually identify enemy and friendly forces and survive direct hits. And it's one of our most lethal aircraft, especially against moving targets, with its 1,174 rounds of ammunition, missiles, rockets and bombs. Not only is the A-10 best equipped for close air support, but it is crucial to leading combat search and rescue missions of downed pilots. After the barbaric murder of a captured Jordanian F-16 pilot by ISIS, these capabilities are more important than ever -- indeed, A-10s are on round-the-clock alert during American missions against ISIS.

The A-10 was designed as a Cold War tank killer, and its cannon is the only one in the Air Force that can fire armor-piercing depleted-uranium 30-millimeter bullets. In a recent hearing, I asked the general in charge of our forces in South Korea what the loss of the A-10 would mean for our anti-armor capabilities. It would leave a major gap, he conceded.

Critics knock the age of our A-10 fleet; the last one was delivered in 1984. But with maintenance and upgrades -- we just spent $1 billion on improvements to the A-10 fleet -- age by itself isn't a reason to retire the plane. And it's far from the oldest plane in our fleet: Those same critics celebrate the B-52, the youngest of which is almost 53 years old and won't be retired until 2040.

Those trying to retire the A-10 also claim it isn't ""survivable"" -- an amazing claim, given the long list of stories about the plane's ability to take fire and still fly. In 2003, Capt. Kim Campbell was flying over Baghdad when her A-10 was hit by a surface-to-air missile, punching a large hole in the plane and knocking out its hydraulics. Most planes would have been destroyed; Captain Campbell switched into a mode only available in the A-10 -- manual reversion, where you fly the aircraft by brute force, manually pulling on cables when you move the control stick -- and flew home safely.

Last year the Air Force said it needed to close A-10 squadrons to free up maintenance personnel. Arguing to scrap a lifesaving workhorse like the A-10 to solve a staffing challenge, while maintaining 15 different musical bands, makes one question the Air Force's priorities.

Despite all those changing arguments, Air Force leadership told me during a hearing in March that the A-10 decision is simply about money. And yet the A-10 has the lowest per-flight-hour cost of any aircraft.

The A-10 remains in high demand: Warthogs are deployed to the Middle East, where they have been inciting fear in the ranks of Islamist terrorists since their deployment in September, and Romania, where 12 A-10s from the squadron I commanded train with our allies in the face of increased Russian aggression.

Yet the administration and the Pentagon persist. Recently, Air Force leaders said the fight to save the A-10 was ""emotional."" Of course it is. Just ask the families of Master Sergeant Wells and his men. The A-10 has supporters because we know it works -- and that the American military can't afford to retire it.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444

The Ukrainian crisis has threatened the stability
of relations between Russia and the West, including the nuclear dimension -- as became apparent last month
when it was reported that Russian defense officials had advised President Vladimir V. Putin to consider placing
Russia's nuclear arsenal on alert during last year's crisis in Crimea.
Diplomatic efforts have done little to ease the new nuclear tension. This makes it all the more critical for Russia
and the United States to talk, to relieve the pressures to ''use or lose'' nuclear forces during a crisis and minimize
the risk of a mistaken launch.
The fact is that we are still living with the nuclear-strike doctrine of the Cold War, which dictated three strategic
options: first strike, launch on warning and post-attack retaliation. There is no reason to believe that Russia and
the United States have discarded these options, as long as the architecture of ''mutually assured destruction''
remains intact.
For either side, the decision to launch on warning -- in an attempt to fire one's nuclear missiles before they are
destroyed -- would be made on the basis of information from early-warning satellites and ground radar. Given the
15- to 30-minute flight times of strategic missiles, a decision to launch after an alert of an apparent attack must be
made in minutes.
This is therefore the riskiest scenario, since provocations or malfunctions can trigger a global catastrophe. Since
computer-based information systems have been in place, the likelihood of such errors has been minimized. But
the emergence of cyberwarfare threats has increased the potential for false alerts in early-warning systems. The
possibility of an error cannot be ruled out.
American officials have usually played down the launch-on-warning option. They have argued instead for the
advantages of post-attack retaliation, which would allow more time to analyze the situation and make an
intelligent decision. Neither the Soviet Union nor Russia ever stated explicitly that it would pursue a similar
strategy, but an emphasis on mobile missile launchers and strategic submarines continues to imply a similar
reliance on an ability to absorb an attack and carry out retaliatory strikes.
Today, however, Russia's early warning system is compromised. The last of the satellites that would have
detected missile launches from American territory and submarines in the past stopped functioning last fall. This
has raised questions about Russia's very ability to carry out launch-on-warning attacks.
Partly to compensate for the loss of its space-based system, Russia has deployed prefabricated radar units that
can be set up quickly along its borders. Some of these are already operational; some are still being tested. Unlike
satellite networks, radar can provide accurate information about the scale and targeting of a missile attack -- but
only once a missile has entered its vicinity, which would most likely be 10 to 15 minutes after launch.
The upside of radar reporting is more information. The downside of having to wait is that it cuts the time for
deciding whether to launch on warning. That in turn increases the likelihood of mistaken retaliation. For a
submarine missile fired from the Norwegian Sea, Russia's radar network would give its nuclear decision makers
just 10 minutes to respond. America's early warning systems can be expected to provide about twice as much
time.

Clearly, for either side, these timelines are very compressed and the opportunities for ill-considered decisions
very real. Launch-on-warning puts enormous strain on the nuclear chains of command in both countries.
In theory, no sensible head of state would authorize a launch-on-warning strike after receiving information that
just one missile, or a small number of missiles, were inbound, on the assumption that this was not an intentional,
full-scale attack. But the launch-on-warning doctrine still rules in both Russia and the United States -- in which
case the risk, however small, of cataclysmic error remains.
This risk should motivate the presidents of Russia and the United States to decide in tandem to eliminate the
launch-on-warning concept from their nuclear strategies. They should reinstitute military-to-military talks, which
were suspended over the Ukraine crisis, to pursue this stand-down as an urgent priority. (A joint decision on this
would not destabilize nuclear deterrence: Both countries still have nuclear forces designed to withstand a
first-strike attack, guaranteeing retaliatory strikes.)
To reinforce this accord, both countries should refrain from conducting military exercises that involve practicing
missile launches based on information from early warning systems. Even if this restraint cannot yet be fully
verified, it would be a valuable contribution to strategic stability -- and, of course, to preventing an inadvertent
nuclear war. This would be a positive step ahead of the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference that the
United Nations will host later this month.
Detailed verification measures can come later, once better Russian-American relations are restored. The
technical implementation of a decision to abandon the launch-on-warning concept would fall within the framework
of the New Start treaty. A phased reduction of the combat readiness of the strategic nuclear forces would provide
a safer time buffer for nuclear decision making.
In periods of heightened tensions and reduced decision times, the likelihood of human and technical error in
control systems increases. Launch-on-warning is a relic of Cold War strategy whose risk today far exceeds its
value. Our leaders urgently need to talk and, we hope, agree to scrap this obsolete protocol before a devastating

People who have faced no harsh trials seem to fall into that mode, unaware of what it indicates when taking refuge from responsibility for their actions. This is an area where your example can help our society rediscover its courage and its optimism.","This article was adapted from remarks for the fourth annual salute to Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at the Marines' Memorial Club in San Francisco on April 16:

Our country gives hope to millions around the world, and you -- who knew that at one time your job was to fight well -- kept that hope alive. By your service you made clear your choice about what kind of world we want for our children: The world of violent jihadist terrorists, or one defined by Abraham Lincoln when he advised us to listen to our better angels?

I searched for words to pay my respects to all of you here tonight and had to turn to others more articulate than I to convey what our service meant. Someone once said that America is like a bank: If you want to take something out, then you must be willing to put something in.

For the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars -- poorly explained and inconclusive wars, the first major wars since our Revolution fought without a draft forcing some men into the ranks -- the question of what our service meant may loom large in your minds. You without doubt have put something into the nation's moral bank.

Rest assured that by your service, you sent a necessary message to the world and especially to those maniacs who thought by hurting us that they could scare us.

No granite monuments, regardless of how grandly built, can take the place of your raw example of courage, when in your youth you answered your country's call. When you looked past the hot political rhetoric. When you voluntarily left behind life's well-lit avenues. When you signed that blank check to the American people payable with your lives. And, most important, when you made a full personal commitment even while, for over a dozen years, the country's political leadership had difficulty defining our national level of commitment.

You built your own monument with a soldier's faith, embracing an unlimited liability clause and showing America's younger generation at its best when times were at their worst.

Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., arguably the most articulate justice in the Supreme Court's history and himself a combat-experienced infantry officer in our awful Civil War, said: ""As life is action and passion, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived.""

You, my fine veterans, are privileged that you will never face a judgment of having failed to live fully. For you young patriots were more concerned in living life fully than in your own longevity, freely facing daunting odds and the random nature of death and wounds on the battlefield.

So long as you maintain that same commitment to others and that same enthusiasm for life's challenges that you felt in yourself, your shipmates, your comrades and buddies, you will never question at age 45 on a shrink's couch whether you have lived.

Veterans know the difference between being in a dangerous combat zone and being in close combat, seeking out and killing the enemy. Close combat is tough. Much of the rest of war is boring if hard work. Yet nothing is mentally crippling about hard work in dangerous circumstances, as shown by generations of American veterans who came thankfully home as better men and women.

Close combat, however, is an ""incommunicable experience"" -- again quoting Holmes. Then there was Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the Union general, who spoke of war's effects, distinguishing the impact of close combat from military service in general. He said that such combat is ""a test of character, it makes bad men worse and good men better.""

We are masters of our character, choosing what we will stand for in this life. Veterans today have had a unique privilege, that of having seen the tenacious spirit of our lads, like those young grunts preparing for a patrol by loosely wrapping tourniquets on their limbs so they could swiftly stop their own bleeding if their legs were blown off. Yet day after day they stoically patrolled. Adversity, we are told, reveals a man to himself, and young patriots coming home from such patrols are worth more than gold, for nothing they face can ever again be that tough.

Now, most of us lost friends, the best of friends, and we learned that war's glory lay only in them -- there is no other glory in warfare. They were friends who proved their manhood at age 18, before they could legally drink a beer. They were young men and women taking responsibility for their own actions, never playing the victim card. Rather, they took responsibility for their own reaction to adversity.

This was something that we once took for granted in ourselves and in our buddies, units where teenagers naturally stood tall, and we counted on each other. Yet it is a characteristic that can seem oddly vacant in our post-military society, where victimhood often seems to be celebrated. We found in the ranks that we were all coequal, general or private, admiral or seaman. We were equally committed to the mission and to one another, a thought captured by Gen. Robert E. Lee, saying his spirit bled each time one of his men fell.

Looking back over my own service, I realize now how fortunate I was to experience all this and the many riotous excursions I had when I was privileged to march or fight beside you. And a question comes to mind: What can I do to repay our country for the privilege of learning things that only you in this room could have taught me? For today I feel sorry for those who were not there with us when trouble loomed. I sometimes wonder how to embrace those who were not with us, those who were not so fortunate to discover what we were privileged to learn when we were receiving our Masters and Ph.D.s in how to live life, and gaining the understanding and appreciation of small things that we would otherwise have never known.

How do we embrace our fellow citizens who weren't there? America is too large at heart for divisions between us. If we became keenly aware of anything at war, it was what is printed on our coins: ""E Pluribus Unum"" -- out of many, one.

We veterans did our patriotic duty, nothing more, certainly nothing less, and we need to ""come home"" like veterans of all America's wars. Come home stronger and more compassionate, not characterized as damaged, or with disorders, or with syndromes or other disease labels. Not labeled dependent on the government even as we take the lead in care of our grievously wounded comrades and hold our Gold Star families close. We deserve nothing more than a level playing field in America, for we endured nothing more, and often less, than vets of past wars.

For whatever trauma came with service in tough circumstances, we should take what we learned -- take our post-traumatic growth -- and, like past generations coming home, bring our sharpened strengths to bear, bring our attitude of gratitude to bear. And, most important, we should deny cynicism a role in our view of the world.

We know that in tough times cynicism is just another way to give up, and in the military we consider cynicism or giving up simply as forms of cowardice. No matter how bad any situation, cynicism has no positive impact. Watching the news, you might notice that cynicism and victimhood often seem to go hand-in-hand, but not for veterans. People who have faced no harsh trials seem to fall into that mode, unaware of what it indicates when taking refuge from responsibility for their actions. This is an area where your example can help our society rediscover its courage and its optimism.

We also learned the pleasure of exceeding expectations. We saw the power we brought when working together as a team. We learned alongside one another, in teams where admired leadership built teamwork, where free men and women could change the world.

Now having seen the moon shine on the other side of the world and having worked with others of many cultures, having worked in one of the most diverse teams on earth -- that of the U.S. military -- and having faced down grim circumstances without losing our sense of humor or moral balance under conditions where war's realities scrape away civilization's veneer, we have learned that nothing can stop our spirit unless we ignore Lincoln's call to our better angels.

American colleges and businesses know your pedigree for commitment, reliability and loyalty. This is why so many corporations and startups aggressively recruit veterans. As San Francisco-based Uber sums it up: Veterans deliver higher value. Bellwether companies like Microsoft, Uber, Starbucks and more act on that premise.

I will close with words again borrowed from others.

From Alexander Dumas: You should be satisfied with the way you have conducted yourselves, ""with no remorse for the past, confident regarding the present and full of hope for the future."" When you retire to bed you should sleep ""the sleep of the brave.""

If Jackie Robinson, a sparkling ballplayer and veteran of World War II, could write his own epitaph on leadership by saying ""A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives,"" then you who are fortunate to have learned so much living in the greatest country on earth while making an impact so young -- you should recognize that our country needs your vigor and wisdom. It was gained at great cost to our comrades and to our Gold Star families, who need to see their sons' spirits live on in your enthusiasm for life.

It's more likely that Iran isn't capable of doing so. What is needed is decisive U.S. leadership. Without it, the long-term entrenchment of Islamic State in Iraq may become a disturbing reality.","In the closing years of the Vietnam War it was often noted sardonically that the ""victories"" against the Viet Cong were moving steadily closer to Saigon. The same could be said of Baghdad and the victories claimed against Islamic State, or ISIS, in Iraq in the past year. The ISIS takeover of Ramadi in the Anbar province over the weekend exposed the hollowness of the reported progress against ISIS. The U.S.-led bombing campaign in support of Iraqi forces isn't working.

Clearly, the Iraqi government needs greater military assistance if it is to defeat what is proving to be a formidable enemy. ISIS in Iraq, the successor of al Qaeda in Iraq, is made up of Iraqi Sunnis and foreign Islamist fighters, similar to those the U.S. Army and Marines fought so hard for so many years. ISIS has routinely defeated other rebel groups in neighboring Syria and claimed large swaths of that country's territory. The militants almost took the Iraqi Kurdish capital city of Erbil in February, despite the fierce resistance of the vaunted fighters of the Kurdish Peshmerga.

Shiite militias -- some armed by Iran and manned by Iranian fighters -- haven't performed well against ISIS on the battlefield. After a month of fighting in Tikrit, during which the Iraqi media estimate some 5,000 Shiite militiamen were killed, ISIS abandoned the city once the U.S. and its allies began airstrikes in late March. That is what happens in guerrilla warfare. Having extracted its price in blood, ISIS withdrew rather than endure heavy casualties.

When Iraqi armed forces confronted ISIS in Anbar province in the second week of April, the Islamists responded with the massive counterattack that ultimately took Ramadi, the provincial capital, and they also attacked the Beiji oil refinery. ISIS now effectively controls the refinery, though it is too damaged to operate for now.

We are in communication with members of the Iraqi military, who report that Iraq's special forces performed well against ISIS fighters in Ramadi. The special forces are the only ones with the technical ability to call in accurate airstrikes. But the regular Iraqi army continues to struggle. In a fight in northern Anbar last month, Iraqi soldiers were butchered after they ran out of ammunition, while a convoy of armored Humvees sent to rescue them was ambushed with a senior commander of the Iraqi army among the many killed.

The defense of Ramadi, according to our sources, was largely left to local Sunni tribesman who were small in number and unreliable allies. The Iraqi government may now be responding to the Ramadi challenge -- on Monday 3,000 mostly Shiite paramilitary forces were reported massing outside the city, intent on trying to retake it.

Tens of thousands of refugees from Anbar are now testing the capabilities of Iraq's authorities. It is no coincidence that terrorist bombings in Baghdad, which had enjoyed a prolonged period of relative quiet, have increased as refugees began flooding into the city. Now there are scores of bombings weekly. ISIS has always fomented strife between communities, and no doubt hopes that Shiite militias will retaliate against the Sunnis fleeing Anbar.

U.S.-led airstrikes have allowed the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, a Shiite, to consolidate its power even as it cedes ground to Iranian-backed Shiite militias of questionable motivations. The airstrikes may not have reversed ISIS gains, but the bombing campaign has complicated ISIS recruitment, financing, command and control, logistics and operational capabilities.

But that is not enough. The U.S. needs to play a more robust role against ISIS before conditions in Iraq deteriorate further. The Pentagon should employ more ground operations by Special Operations forces, like the raid in eastern Syria on Friday that took out ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf. More Apache attack helicopters and transport planes are also needed, as is a brigade dedicated to improving operational command and intelligence support.

Moreover, the Pentagon needs to end the ""boots on the ground"" shell game of relying on temporary deployments to work around the president's 3,000 personnel cap, which has proved dysfunctional. Most of the U.S. troops currently in Iraq are training and advising Iraqi forces. That is useful, but more need to be embedded with Iraqi units to improve the accuracy of U.S.-led airstrikes.

American logistics assets, whether uniformed or contractor, should be deployed to supply the Iraqi army -- the least we can do is ensure that Iraqi soldiers don't have to worry about running out of ammunition. In addition, the U.S. must return to its role as an honest broker between Iraq's majority Shiites and minority Sunnis, as it did in 2006-07 with great success.

Like it or not, the U.S. is the only country with the strength and know-how to rid Iraq of ISIS. Iran's proxy forces are on the defensive in Syria and have made no overall progress in Iraq. Some argue that Iran isn't serious in trying to defeat ISIS. It's more likely that Iran isn't capable of doing so. What is needed is decisive U.S. leadership. Without it, the long-term entrenchment of Islamic State in Iraq may become a disturbing reality.",6,Warfighting,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Deptula, David",2010,1,2015-06-06,,0,0,WaPO,Air Force,,,M,Bombing Our Way to Victory,Let's stop unnecessarily restricting our asymmetric advantage and get on with the task of destroying the Islamic State as quickly as possible through the optimal use of air power. America's enemies are exploiting our humanity to impose their terror. It is time to change strategy.,"Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter's recent remarks on the efficacy of Iraq's army reflect the fact that, despite years of training by thousands of U.S. and coalition forces, the army has not been able to halt Islamic State aggression. What makes anyone think that a few more months of similar training will yield success?

We must not, however, confuse Iraq's objectives with critical U.S. national security interests. While the two may overlap, they are not the same. Each demands its own strategic, military and policy approach. From the U.S. perspective, the most important goal is not the maintenance of the Iraqi government but the destruction of the Islamic State.

The current U.S.-led coalition is following the counterinsurgency model used in Iraq and Afghanistan for more than a decade, but the Islamic State is not an insurgency. The Islamic State is a self-declared sovereign government. We must stop trying to fight the last war and develop a new strategy.

The Islamic State can be decomposed through a comprehensive and robust air campaign designed to: (1) terminate its expansion; (2) paralyze and isolate its command-and-control capability; (3) undermine its ability to control the territory it occupies; and (4) eliminate its ability to export terror.

But to do these things, air power has to be applied like a thunderstorm, not a drizzle. In the campaign against the Islamic State, we are averaging 12 strike sorties per day. During Operation Desert Storm in Iraq and Kuwait in 1991, the average was 1,241; in Operation Allied Force in Kosovo in 1999, it was 298; in the first 30 days of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, 691; during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001, 86.

In the past two decades, several strategic victories were brought about by air power operating in conjunction with indigenous ground forces - none of which were better than the Iraqi army. Robust air power, along with a few air controllers, carried the Northern Alliance to victory over the Taliban, at minimal cost in blood and treasure to the United States. Bosnia, Kosovo and Libya similarly involved airstrikes well in excess of those being used against the Islamic State.

Complicating the effort to defeat the Islamic State is an excessive focus on the avoidance of collateral damage and casualties. In an armed conflict, the military establishes rules of engagement designed to balance the moral imperative to minimize damage and unintentional casualties against what's required to accomplish the mission. Recently reported by pilots actually fighting the Islamic State is that the current rules - which far exceed accepted ""Law of War"" standards - impose excessive restrictions that work to the advantage of the enemy. The ponderous and unnecessary set of procedures in place is allowing the Islamic State to exploit our desire to avoid civilian causalities to commit atrocities on the ground.

We have the finest, most professional men and women flying the finest combat aircraft in the world. The best way to improve our force effectiveness while still minimizing collateral damage and casualties is to allow them to use their judgment. This is called ""mission command,"" and the Pentagon should empower our aviators to employ it.

The fastest way to end the inhumanity of war is to eliminate its source - in this case, the Islamic State - as quickly as possible. Gradualism doomed the effectiveness of air power in the ""Rolling Thunder"" air campaign from 1965 to 1968 during the Vietnam War. The current gradualist approach is worsening the suffering and increasing the loss of innocent life. While unintended casualties of war are regrettable, those associated with airstrikes pale in comparison with the savage acts being carried out by the Islamic State. What is the logic of a policy that restricts the use of air power to avoid the possibility of collateral damage while allowing the certainty of the Islamic State's crimes against humanity?

This does not have to be a ""long war,"" as has been claimed by those whose politics benefit from that assertion, as well as those whose experience is rooted in counterinsurgency. The counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan went on for eight and 14 years, respectively. Desert Storm took 43 days; Bosnia's Operation Deliberate Force, 22 days; Allied Force, 78 days; the decisive phase of Enduring Freedom took 60 days. A robust air campaign can devastate the Islamic State to the point where Iraqi and Kurdish forces can end the occupation.

Let's stop unnecessarily restricting our asymmetric advantage and get on with the task of destroying the Islamic State as quickly as possible through the optimal use of air power. America's enemies are exploiting our humanity to impose their terror. It is time to change strategy.",9,Warfighting,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444

"Shelton, William",2014,1,2015-07-01,,0,0,WSJ,Air Force,,,M,American Security After the SpaceX Explosion,The House and Senate bills will be reconciled in the near future. It is up to the senior leadership of the Armed Services Committees and a conference committee to protect U.S. national security by ensuring that we always have more than one reliable rocket to launch all of our military satellites.,"The explosion of an unmanned SpaceX rocket after liftoff at Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Sunday was a graphic reminder of why U.S. national space policy requires that there be two independent means of launching satellites for national-security missions: in case one launch system fails.

SpaceX, headed by Elon Musk, is contracted to resupply the International Space Station. Critics who are unhappy about the use of Russian rocket engines for national-security launches have campaigned to get SpaceX involved in those missions. But the failure of its Falcon 9 version 1.1 rocket should give everyone pause about jettisoning a dependable arrangement vital to U.S. security.

Current U.S. space policy is implemented by buying both the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets from the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Both rockets have a 100% success record -- 83 launches without failure.

Yet Congress is on the verge of passing legislation -- the fiscal 2016 National Defense Authorization Act -- that will put U.S. space policy at considerable risk.

The problem arose last year from attacks on United Launch Alliance as a monopoly and for using Russian-made engines on its rockets. These criticisms ignore why the two companies, with the government's blessing, formed a joint venture in 2005. There was simply not enough business to sustain two domestic launch companies.

Today the Atlas V lofts two-thirds of all national-security satellites. The first stage of the rocket is powered by the Russian-produced RD-180 engine. The U.S. government encouraged Lockheed Martin to use this engine primarily because of its performance and relatively low cost. There was also a desire to keep Russian rocket scientists at work for us, and not on projects for other countries perhaps less friendly to the U.S.

Still, the U.S. Air Force does seek to lower launch costs, and an important part of its plan is to get new entrants into the rocket business. Today several companies are attempting to do just that. But before any new company can compete for national-security launch contracts, it must pass a rigorous certification process to ensure its rocket or rockets are reliable.

SpaceX is the first company to complete the certification process for its Falcon 9 version 1.1 rocket -- the one that failed on Sunday. But the company is also developing a ""Full Thrust"" Falcon 9 -- capable of carrying all but the heaviest satellites -- and that is the rocket it intends to use to bid on national-security contracts.

The Falcon 9 Full Thrust version hasn't gone through certification. Indeed it has never been launched. Nevertheless, SpaceX lobbyists last year convinced key congressional leaders that their rocket is ready to launch national-security missions. The company's criticism of United Launch Alliance and its Russian-produced RD-180 engines -- including a widely publicized antitrust lawsuit it filed in April 2014 (then withdrawn in January) -- played very well on Capitol Hill and in public opinion.

As a result, the fiscal 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which became law in December, banned using the Russian-made RD-180 beyond the remaining few engines already under contract. The purported rationale is to uphold Russian sanctions and avoid rewarding the country's bad behavior in Ukraine and elsewhere.

Fair enough: It is smart policy to seek an alternative to a supplier based in a more bellicose Russia. But an abrupt ban is not smart. The Air Force has a more cautious transition plan -- which would not curtail the RD-180 until there are two certified alternatives -- but congressional action is causing that plan to unravel.

The December legislation also mandated that a new American rocket engine be ready by 2019. United Launch Alliance has announced that it will develop a new engine, and a new rocket, to replace the Atlas V, and will do so on time. Many experts are dubious about this timetable. Yet even if United Launch Alliance can meet the deadline, it will run out of RD-180 engines well before its new rocket is ready. United Launch Alliance has also announced that it will stop production of its far more expensive Delta IV (with the exception of a variant that can lift the heaviest U.S. satellites).

Therein lies the risk. Once United Launch Alliance runs out of RD-180 engines and Delta IV production stops, the only available rocket for most payloads will be SpaceX's uncertified Falcon 9 Full Thrust. The long-standing national space policy to ensure two means of access to space for national-security satellites will be ended, essentially by congressional fiat.

As a boss taught me long ago, the first rule of wing walking is to never let go until you have a firm grasp on the next handhold. Yet our pique at Russia, coupled with effective lobbying, has resulted in legislation that is tantamount to letting go.

In April the House of Representatives passed a new, slightly revised fiscal 2016 National Defense Authorization Act. It contains a clause that allows the secretary of defense to waive the ban on the RD-180 for as long as needed if the secretary deems it in the national interest to do so. The Senate's version, passed on June 18, limits the waiver to a maximum of nine engines, thereby ensuring the elimination of the Atlas V from competition.

The House and Senate bills will be reconciled in the near future. It is up to the senior leadership of the Armed Services Committees and a conference committee to protect U.S. national security by ensuring that we always have more than one reliable rocket to launch all of our military satellites.

"Petraeus, David and O'Hanlon, Michael",2011,1,2015-07-08,,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Afghanistan After Obama,"Unfortunately, having displayed such patience, the president is now assuming that neither his successor nor the American public has the desire - or stomach - to continue even a modest U.S. effort in Afghanistan after 2016. Obama's plan is to remove all operational combat forces from the country by the end of his tenure. Only a small training mission and embassy guard operation would continue. This plan raises considerable questions.","For a leader who has been criticized for trying to rush out of wars to satisfy campaign promises, President Obama has been relatively resolute in Afghanistan. To be sure, he reduced U.S. forces there faster than some (including us) believed optimal starting in July 2011 - but only after having tripled the number of troops there during the first two years of his presidency. And the drawdown did not begin until he worked with coalition partners at the 2010 NATO Summit in Lisbon to extend the mission from 2011 to 2014, a horizon extended again last year. Beyond that, while he declared an end to the NATO combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of last year, he also authorized Americans to continue to participate in numerous difficult and dangerous operations, including counterterrorism activities in support of Afghan forces, when needed. Some 10,000 U.S. troops continue the fight in support of what is principally now an Afghan-led and Afghan-dominated mission.

Unfortunately, having displayed such patience, the president is now assuming that neither his successor nor the American public has the desire - or stomach - to continue even a modest U.S. effort in Afghanistan after 2016. Obama's plan is to remove all operational combat forces from the country by the end of his tenure. Only a small training mission and embassy guard operation would continue. This plan raises considerable questions.

The right approach is for Obama to protect our investment in Afghanistan and to hand off to his successor military forces and tools that will still be critically needed in 2017 and beyond. We can schedule an end to our role in that nation's conflict, but we cannot schedule an end to the war there or an end to the threat from al-Qaeda, the Islamic State or other extremist elements of the global jihad. Moreover, the Afghan political leadership and public overwhelmingly want us to stay.

We went to Afghanistan for a compelling reason: to ensure that Afghanistan never again served as a sanctuary for al-Qaeda, as it did when the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were planned there under the Taliban. The importance of that mission continues.

Although al-Qaeda's senior leadership has been seriously degraded over the years, its remaining leaders and kindred organizations remain ensconced in the Pashtun belt of Pakistan's tribal areas and in some Afghan communities. We have no realistic way to deal with threats in this region without bases in eastern Afghanistan; the Indian Ocean is too far away, and we have no good options for alternative land bases. The frequency of U.S. action against extremists in this area may decline somewhat; indeed, it already has. But the need for close surveillance and occasional kinetic missions cannot be ruled out. Indeed, if extremists knew that we had deprived ourselves of such capabilities, they would be even more likely to seek sanctuary in this strategic region.

Beyond our own global counterterrorism exigencies, Afghanistan itself still needs help. The situation there is not hopeless, but it is serious. Helmand province is at risk in the south, as are Kunduz and other areas in the nation's north. The east, always troubled and always threatened by the Haqqani network based in Pakistan's tribal areas, is still turbulent. And Kabul still suffers periodic attacks, such as the recent assault on the parliament.

But all is not lost. Far from it. Kabul is much safer than most cities in war zones - and for that matter, a number of cities in Latin America. Indeed, Afghan forces successfully repelled the attempt on the parliament, killing all the attackers. Kandahar, the original haven of the Taliban, is under government control. Mazar-e Sharif in the north and Herat in the west are doing reasonably well. The country's ring road and other major highways are generally secure. As the Pentagon's June ""Report on Enhancing Security and Stability in Afghanistan"" put it, ""The resilient Taliban-led insurgency remains an enduring threat,"" but ""Although the Taliban spread its footprint across the country, it suffered considerable casualties and did not accomplish any of its major strategic or operational objectives in 2014."" To their enormous credit, Afghan soldiers and police continue to sustain many of the gains of recent years, even after NATO forces have drawn down by 90 percent.

But Afghan forces have paid a heavy price, losing several thousand personnel a year. And this year's casualties are at least 50 percent greater than last year's, according to U.S. officials in Afghanistan. The Taliban is testing our Afghan partners. So far, they are holding, but the situation is fraught.

In these circumstances, we should be wary of removing those key enablers - in the form of U.S. air power, intelligence, combat advisers and Special Operations forces - that Afghanistan still needs from us. Indeed, the Pentagon report called into question the ability of Afghan forces to hold off the Taliban without coalition support. We believe these concerns are justified. Going to a ""zero option"" next year would be playing roulette with Afghanistan's future.

The right approach for the United States is not to pull out next year but to keep several bases and several thousand U.S. and other NATO-coalition troops in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future. And the NATO Summit in Poland next summer could be the vehicle for gaining coalition agreement on a further extension of the mission. In fact, the summit could help advance the idea that rather than conceiving of such a commitment as an interminable nation-building exercise, the right way to think of it would be as an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, a front-line state in the struggle against Islamist extremists.

Yes, such an operation would have real American costs - perhaps $5 billion to $10 billion a year in U.S. military expenses, on top of $2 billion to $3 billion to help sustain Afghan forces at roughly current size, and undoubtedly some U.S. casualties. But compared with the investment to date, of well over 2,000 American lives and nearly $1 trillion in expense, and compared with the specter of another major terrorist attack against the U.S. homeland devised or launched out of a South Asian terrorist sanctuary, such costs are bearable - and the right call for this nation.",10,Warfighting,,1,,,,The authors are harshly criticizing Obama's actions/stances on Afghanistan ,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Scales, Robert",2000,1,2015-08-02,,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Our Army is Breaking,"Sadly, the Army that stayed cohesive in Iraq and Afghanistan even after losing 5,000 dead is now being broken again by an ungrateful, ahistorical and strategically tone-deaf leadership in Washington.","Last month, Gen. Raymond Odierno, outgoing Army chief of staff, and Gen. Mark Milley, his successor, testified to the difficulties faced by the Army. I'd like to make the same points by telling a story.

When I was a boy, tonsillitis was a dangerous illness. In 1952, it kept me in Tokyo General Hospital for weeks. I shared a cramped ward with dozens of soldiers horribly maimed in Korea. The hospital had only one movie theater. I remember watching a Western sandwiched between bandage- and plaster-wrapped bodies. I remember the antiseptic smells, the cloud of cigarette smoke and the whispers of young men still traumatized by the horrors of the war they had just left.

My dad came from Korea to visit me, and I recall our conversations vividly. At the time he was operations officer for the 2nd Engineer Battalion. He told me how poorly his men were prepared for war. Many had been killed or captured by the North Koreans. During the retreat from the Yalu River, some of his soldiers were in such bad physical shape that they dropped exhausted along the road to wait to be taken captive.

""We have no sergeants, son,"" he told me, shaking his head, ""and without them we are no longer an Army.""

In the early '70s, I was the same age as my Korean-era dad. I had just left Vietnam only to face another broken Army. My barracks were at war. I carried a pistol to protect myself from my own soldiers. Many of the soldiers were on hard drugs. The barracks were racial battlegrounds pitting black against white. Again, the Army had broken because the sergeants were gone. By 1971, most were either dead, wounded or had voted with their feet to get away from such a devastated institution.

I visited Baghdad in 2007 as a guest of Gen. David Petraeus. Before the trip I had written a column forecasting another broken Army, but it was clear from what Petraeus showed me that the Army was holding on and fighting well in the dangerous streets of Baghdad. Such a small and overcommitted force should have broken after so many serial deployments to that hateful place. But Petraeus said that his Army was different. It held together because junior leaders were still dedicated to the fight. To this day, I don't know how they did it.

Sadly, the Army that stayed cohesive in Iraq and Afghanistan even after losing 5,000 dead is now being broken again by an ungrateful, ahistorical and strategically tone-deaf leadership in Washington.

The Obama administration just announced a 40,000 reduction in the Army's ranks. But the numbers don't begin to tell the tale. Soldiers stay in the Army because they love to go into the field and train; Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently said that the Army will not have enough money for most soldiers to train above the squad level this year. Soldiers need to fight with new weapons; in the past four years, the Army has canceled 20 major programs, postponed 125 and restructured 124. The Army will not replace its Reagan-era tanks, infantry carriers, artillery and aircraft for at least a generation. Soldiers stay in the ranks because they serve in a unit ready for combat; fewer than a third of the Army's combat brigades are combat ready. And this initial 40,000 soldier reduction is just a start. Most estimates from Congress anticipate that without lifting the budget sequestration that is driving this across-the-board decline, another 40,000 troops will be gone in about two years.

But it's soldiers who tell the story. After 13 years of war, young leaders are voting with their feet again. As sergeants and young officers depart, the institution is breaking for a third time in my lifetime. The personal tragedies that attended the collapse of a soldier's spirit in past wars are with us again. Suicide, family abuse, alcohol and drug abuse are becoming increasingly more common.

To be sure, the nation always reduces its military as wars wind down. Other services suffer reductions and shortages. But only the Army breaks. Someone please tell those of us who served why the service that does virtually all the dying and killing in war is the one least rewarded.

My grandson is a great kid. He's about the same age I was when I was recovering at Tokyo General. Both of his parents served as Army officers, so it's no wonder that in school he draws pictures of tanks and planes while his second-grade classmates draw pictures of flowers and animals. The other day he drew a tank just for me and labeled it proudly: ""Abrams Tank!""

Well, sadly, if he follows in our footsteps, one day he may be fighting in an Abrams tank. His tank will be 60 years old by then.

The article ""Graham moved up in ranks as reservist"" stated that Sen. Lindsey O. Graham was assigned to be a stateside instructor of lawyers and paralegals, and he stated as much in his biography. But, instead of teaching, he persuaded the military brass to ignore his official assignment so that he could serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. The article said he went there 19 times and served 142 days. He doesn't mention this extraordinary service in his promotional materials for his presidential campaign.

Apparently, Mr. Graham was too modest to correct the record to reflect his far more impressive service. He stands even higher in my estimation than he did before I read the article.

l

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham served nine times under my command in his capacity as an officer in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. This included three times in Iraq while I was commander there, three times in Afghanistan while I was commander there and three additional stints in Afghanistan when I was the commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in both countries. Each assignment was typically a week or more in duration.

While in theater, Mr. Graham did not seek special treatment as a member of Congress, nor did he seek to publicize his service.

On putting on the uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Graham made it clear that he wanted to be treated as Col. Graham, not Sen. Graham. He took on quiet assignments that capitalized on his expertise as a lawyer and judge advocate general officer and that typically required him to travel widely in each country. This included work in areas such as the reform of Iraq's troubled detainee operations, contributing to the detainee review process that we ultimately established and a variety of other rule-of-law challenges we confronted in each country. His contributions were substantive and valuable.

No other member of Congress, while in office, served remotely as much time deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan as did Mr. Graham. Those of us who were privileged to serve with him remain grateful to him for the contributions he made to our nation while in uniform.

"Odierno, Raymond",2015,1,2015-08-14,,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,This is no Time to Cut the U.S. Army,"We owe it to them to provide the right equipment and the best training; and we owe it to the American people to have an Army that is sized, equipped and prepared to meet the uncertain security challenges that lie ahead.","For almost 40 years, I have had the honor to serve alongside the great men and women of the United States Army. I have been inspired by their professionalism and unwavering commitment to the mission, to the Army, and to the nation. Our leaders at every level have displayed unparalleled ingenuity, flexibility and adaptability. Our soldiers have displayed mental and physical toughness and courage under fire. They have transformed the Army into the most agile, adaptive and expeditionary strategic land force the world has ever known.

Today, the Army is engaged in Iraq, Afghanistan and Jordan; in Kosovo, the Korean Peninsula and across the African continent. We have rotational forces in Europe, Kuwait and the Pacific. And our missions are both wide-ranging and essential. The missions include humanitarian assistance, training and advising forces in combat, and reassuring allies with a dedicated U.S. military presence.

As the velocity of world-wide instability rises, the demand for the U.S. Army escalates around the globe, with American soldiers responding where others either won't or can't. The threats they face are more complex and diverse than at any other point in recent memory. The nation's enemies are determined, and they increasingly have the capability to threaten regional and world order, as well as America's physical security and economic stability.

The unpredictable strategic landscape is marked by Russian aggression, China's military modernization, North Korea's belligerence and the rise of anarchy, extremism and terrorism, led by Islamic State, in North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. All this while the U.S. military also maintains an advise-and-assist mission in Afghanistan, supplies global disaster relief, and protects against continued threats to the homeland.

These burdens on the military, coupled with persistent budget pressures, have brought the country to an important inflection point. Decisions made in Washington today regarding defense must be based on the world as it is, not the world as we wish it to be.

Throughout American history, the Army, in concert with the other services, has been a powerful deterrent and the nation's ultimate insurance policy. Unfortunately, at the conclusion of every major conflict the Army has taken disproportionate cuts in personnel and resources that undercut deterrence and ultimately cost American lives in subsequent conflicts.

American soldiers suffered enormously from lack of preparation at Kasserine Pass in Tunisia in 1943, the Army's first major encounter with German troops in World War II. At the outset of the Korean War, an ably led but poorly trained and ill-equipped battalion known as Task Force Smith was virtually annihilated. Those episodes serve as poignant examples of the results of myopic decisions that ignore the stark lessons of history. Both times, American soldiers suffered. We need the entirety of our military forces, including the Army, to have the capability and capacity to deal with a wide range of threats on two or three continents simultaneously.

The current environment demands a modern and ready, globally engaged land force. To achieve this, in my view, the optimum size of the active-duty Army is 490,000 troops. But the fiscal gridlock surrounding the Budget Control Act of 2013, also known as sequestration, has already forced us to reduce Army forces to 450,000. If sequestration continues, we will be forced to reduce even further. At that point, the Army will be unable to fulfill its mission.

History has shown that we cannot predict the future with any reasonable degree of accuracy, but we can affirm with absolute certainty that America's Army will be called upon time and time again. When it is, the American people will not want to hear that we lack capacity, that our equipment is behind the times, and that our soldiers are not properly trained or ready to fight.

If that happens, we -- as an Army and as a nation -- will have failed the men and women who courageously volunteered to raise their right hand to defend the Constitution and stand up for their countrymen, protecting the freedoms and liberties.

As I retire on Friday, having served almost four decades in the Army, I have never been prouder to wear this uniform and represent the amazing men and women who every day are willing to protect this great nation. From Vietnam to the Cold War, from Iraq to Afghanistan, and in contingencies around the world, our soldiers have accomplished every task, met every challenge, and defended our nation whenever and wherever asked. We owe it to them to provide the right equipment and the best training; and we owe it to the American people to have an Army that is sized, equipped and prepared to meet the uncertain security challenges that lie ahead.",10,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Petraeus, David and Ross, Dennis",2011,1,2015-08-26,,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,The Bite in the Iran Nuclear Deal,"In other words, deterrence is the key to ensuring not just that the Iranians live up to the agreement but also to preventing them from developing nuclear weapons. Iran must know that we will not permit it to become a nuclear weapons state ever.","Many members of Congress continue to grapple with the nuclear deal with Iran - and so do we. Like us, the undecideds see its benefits: The deal would block the uranium enrichment, plutonium separation and covert paths to a nuclear bomb for the next 15 years. Compared with today, with an Iran that is three months from break-out capability and with a stockpile of 10 bombs' worth of low-enriched uranium, there can be little doubt that a deal leaves us far better off , producing a one-year break-out time and permitting the Iranians less than one bomb's worth of material for the next 15 years . We also don't believe that if Congress blocks the deal, a better one is going to be negotiated. Will the other members of the P5+1 be ready to return to the table because Congress says no? Will they even know who defines the U.S. position and what it is? We doubt it.

So if the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has clear benefits and there is no obvious negotiated alternative , why are we still undecided? Put simply, because the deal places no limits on how much the Iranians can build or expand their nuclear infrastructure after 15 years. Even the monitoring provisions that would continue beyond 15 years may prove insufficient as the Iranian nuclear program grows. And Iran's ability to dramatically increase its output of enriched material after year 15 would be significant, as Iran deploys five advanced models of centrifuges starting in year 10 of the agreement.

In terms of the size of its nuclear program, Iran will be treated like Japan or the Netherlands - but Iran is not Japan or the Netherlands when it comes to its behavior. It is, after all, one of three countries designated by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism. Perhaps in 15 years we will see a very different Iran - not a sponsor of terrorism, not a threat to its neighbors, not led by those who declare that Israel, another U.N.-member state, should be eliminated. But, while we hope that Iran may change, we cannot count on it.

The fact that President Obama emphasizes that the plan depends on verification - not trust - also means that he is not assuming Iran will change. But verification means only that we can catch the Iranians if they cheat; what matters even more is that the Iranians recognize that they will pay a meaningful price when we catch them.

In other words, deterrence is the key to ensuring not just that the Iranians live up to the agreement but also to preventing them from developing nuclear weapons. Iran must know that we will not permit it to become a nuclear weapons state ever.

Now is the time to make it clear that there will be a firewall between Iran's threshold status and its having a nuclear weapon. Now is the time for the Iranians and the world to know that if Iran dashes toward a weapon , especially after year 15, that it will trigger the use of force. At that point, it would be too late for sanctions to preempt an Iranian nuclear fait accompli.

It is critically important for the president to state this clearly, particularly given his perceived hesitancy to use force. Indeed, were Obama to be unequivocal about the use of force should Iran violate its commitment not to seek nuclear weapons, the international community would accept the legitimacy of military strikes in response.

In a letter to Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Obama takes account of the importance of deterring Iran ""from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon."" Even more significantly, he says that his administration ""will take whatever means are necessary . . . including military means"" to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. That is an important statement, but it is followed by devaluing language: ""Should Iran seek to dash toward a nuclear weapon, all of the options available to the United States - including the military option - will remain available through the life of the deal and beyond.""

Surely if the Iranians are dashing toward a weapon, especially after year 15, there is a need not to speak of our options but of our readiness to use force. The threat of force is far more likely to deter the Iranians.

The Iranians also should know that if they produce highly enriched uranium - for which there is no legitimate civilian purpose - that we would see that as an intention to make a weapon and would act accordingly. There is no mention of highly enriched uranium in the president's letter. Although Obama speaks in the letter of providing the Israelis with the BLU-113, a 4,400-pound ""bunker buster"" bomb, it would not be sufficient to penetrate Fordow, the Iranian enrichment site built into a mountain. For that, the Israelis would need the 30,000-pound massive ordnance penetrator (MOP) and the means to carry it. While some may question whether we would act militarily if the Iranians were to dash to a bomb, no one questions whether the Israelis would do so.

Bolstering deterrence is essential in addressing key vulnerabilities we see in the deal. A blunter statement on the consequences of Iran moving toward a weapon and of producing highly enriched uranium would allay some of our concerns. Providing the Israelis the MOP and the means to carry it would surely enhance deterrence - and so would developing options now in advance with the Israelis and key Arab partners to counter Iran's likely surge of support for Hezbollah and other Shiite militias after it gets sanctions relief.

Deterrence would be more effective - and full implementation of the agreement more likely - if the Iranians understand that there will be a price for every transgression, no matter how small, and that we will raise the cost to them of de-stabilizing behavior in the region. The president's letter to Nadler was useful but fell short of addressing our concerns. It is still possible for the administration to do so.

"Roughead, Gary",2011,1,2015-08-27,,0,0,WSJ,Navy,,,M,America Falls Behind Russia in the Arctic Oil Race,Now is the time to ensure that responsible energy exploration and production in the region proceeds at a pace that matches Russia's and China's aggressive efforts.,"In his message to the American people about his visit to Alaska next week, President Obama said ""The alarm bells are ringing, and as long as I'm president, America will lead the world to meet this threat before it's too late."" He was talking about climate change. But his words could just as well apply to the strategic moves that are being made in the vast Arctic region to secure its resources and potential.

Russia is taking the lead in Arctic offshore oil production. Russia began producing offshore oil at the Prirazlomnaya field in the Pechora Sea in 2014, and last year it delivered roughly 2.2 million barrels. Gazprom Neft expects to more than double oil production this year from the country's only offshore Arctic oil project.

China isn't far behind. Between 2009 and 2013, Chinese companies -- mainly the big three, China National Petroleum Corp., Sinopec and China National Offshore Oil Corp. (Cnooc) -- were the largest buyers of international oil assets. Several of these acquisitions were made with the Arctic in mind, such as Canada's Nexen and Russia's Yamal LNG. Early last year, Cnooc obtained an exploration license for Iceland's Dreki region in the Norwegian Sea. The company is also expected to be involved in Norway's 2016 licensing round in the Barents Sea.

Russian and Chinese activity goes beyond a scramble for resources. Russia has added a 6,000-soldier permanent military force, including radar and sensing networks, in the Arctic's northwest Murmansk region. Russia recently submitted a large extended continental-shelf claim for the Arctic, which, if accepted, will give Russia rights to seabed resources beyond its 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. China's maritime activity in the region has increased, and it is making significant investments in Arctic research, infrastructure and natural-resource development. Although not an Arctic nation, China sees the value in building modern icebreakers to support its activity in the polar regions -- north and south.

The dominant posture Russia and China are assuming with regard to Arctic oil and gas stands in contrast to the U.S. After holding a record-breaking lease sale in the Chukchi Sea in 2007, (and collecting billions of dollars for federal coffers), the federal government has failed consistently to demonstrate it has the political will and agency know-how to allow Arctic offshore oil-exploration to move forward.

It may be convenient to take a ""why bother"" approach. After all, the cost of energy is down and we see a bright future in the shale boom. However, the U.S. continues to import 40% of its crude-oil needs -- nearly half of which comes from OPEC members -- at a cost of $23.5 billion a month.

Alaskan energy production from the outer continental shelf can come online in 10 to 15 years, when experts predict shale-oil production in the lower 48 states will plateau and crude-oil production in the Gulf of Mexico will begin to decline.

But the dithering must end soon. According to a recent report by the National Petroleum Council (NPC) and a diverse group of government regulators, nongovernmental organizations, environmentalists, industry leaders and Alaska Native representatives, the federal government needs to facilitate exploration in the offshore Alaskan Arctic now. Failure to act immediately risks a renewed reliance on imported oil and jeopardizes America's global competitiveness, leadership and influence in the Arctic.

President Obama did the right thing in August by finally allowing energy exploration to proceed in the Chukchi Sea. But the approved drilling permit for Royal Dutch Shell remains the only exploration activity in U.S. waters in the Arctic. Now is the time to ensure that responsible energy exploration and production in the region proceeds at a pace that matches Russia's and China's aggressive efforts.

The U.S. recently assumed a two-year term as chairman of the Arctic Council, the world's primary intergovernmental forum on the region. The council focuses on a broad range of issues but not on defense and security. The U.S. can use its chairmanship to take a leadership position on shipping, resources and fisheries standards and practices. It can also set the stage for constructive regional engagement and cooperative investment to enhance overall maritime domain awareness in the Arctic, including joint search-and-rescue and environmental responses.

The U.S. should also use its leadership role to ensure responsible energy exploration and production in the region, bringing to bear America's higher standards of operations, more-stringent safety standards, and a more finely tuned risk-management culture than is practiced on the other side of the Arctic Ocean.

As the NPC report revealed, the U.S. needs Arctic energy exploration. Yet by repeatedly putting the brakes on the development of natural resources in the Arctic, Washington has injected uncertainty into its Arctic policy and threatened the future energy security of U.S. citizens. If we subject energy companies to death by a thousand paper cuts that put stifling bureaucracy over national strategic needs, we will cede this critical strategic region to others with grave economic, security and environmental implications for generations to come.

"Petraeus, David and O'Hanlon, Michael",2011,1,2015-10-14,,0,0,USA Today,Army,,,M,Rebuild American Success; Economic Growth Should Be at the Top of Policy Agenda for US Leaders,"Our purpose here, then, is to remind policymakers that as they establish their priorities for 2016 and beyond, attention to economic fundamentals should play as big a role in their thinking as crisis management and domestic political maneuvering.","As world leaders debated at the United Nations last month, most of the attention seemed to be on hot spots. Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, conflict zones in Africa and East Asia, and the latest news from Afghanistan got lots of discussion. In many respects, this was inevitable, and necessary. Indeed, our own careers have been largely shaped and dominated by such pressing issues.

Even so, in a world of troubling headlines, less dramatic and more structural developments could determine the future of the global order even more than the latest crises. Many of these concern technology and economics.

While military might was a necessary ingredient in the West's victory in the Cold War, it was more like a moat than a battering ram -- it provided time and protection for the inherent strengths of the Western democratic and economic systems to prevail. This is likely to be just as true in the future.

A few basic realities about the modern world need to be remembered. The post-World War II international order set up by U.S. and other key world leaders 70 years ago produced more economic growth in more places on earth, benefiting a far higher percentage of the human race, than had any previous global order in any period in history for which we have data.

Our purpose here, then, is to remind policymakers that as they establish their priorities for 2016 and beyond, attention to economic fundamentals should play as big a role in their thinking as crisis management and domestic political maneuvering.

Indeed, economics can even shape crisis management, if often with a lag effect.

Economic sanctions established by Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and many others brought Iran to the table over its nuclear weapons program (an accurate observation whether one likes the actual deal). Sanctions, together with the fall in global oil prices, might not have yet limited assertive (and illegal) Russian interventions, but they could well constrain President Vladimir Putin in the years ahead.

Beijing's policies in the East China Sea and South China Sea, even if sometimes more assertive than we would like, have exhibited at least some restraint that might reflect an awareness that we could introduce various economic sanctions against China if things got out of hand.

Meanwhile, the North American shale revolution, and the North American economic revolution more generally, have improved U.S. growth prospects and the fundamental strength of the U.S. economic foundation. They have also helped Mexico provide more jobs to its own workers, reducing demographic pressures and actually making the immigration problem easier to address (even if we have not yet managed to address it appropriately and comprehensively).

The implications are many, ranging from major to modest in their importance, but we would highlight the following:

Congress should reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, an efficient (and profit-making) tool for promoting U.S. business interests in foreign markets.

Congress should avoid any government shutdown or self-induced debt crisis over anything except the most historic and major issues (which we do not see on the horizon).

Democrats and Republicans, in shaping their messages and agendas for the 2016 election, should recognize the importance of government programs in areas such as scientific research, infrastructure investment and education, and then fashion budget priorities accordingly.

Both parties and the Obama administration should conclude agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, important for economic growth as well as for setting appropriate standards to help incentivize China to reform economic practices (because TPP membership will not be available to China until it does so).

Meanwhile, the U.S. should join the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and seek to conclude a bilateral investment accord with Beijing, so that Washington is not left behind in important ways in interacting with what is still the world's fastest-growing major economy.

It is all too easy to conflate the temporarily important with the truly significant issues in today's political discourse. It is also easy to view the latest crisis as the be all and end all. But attention to our economy will probably be the most important legacy of political leaders today -- as has often been the case in the past.",10,ForeignPolicy,1,,,,,The fundamental purpose of the article is to try and straighten out those in Washington with respect to economic grwth and what to do about it. ,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444

From what I witnessed first hand I strongly believe that such a force properly positioned would create a deterrent sufficiently intimidating to keep Mr. Putin in his cage for a very long time.,"For an old Cold Warrior the scene on a bright October afternoon was surreal: America's Second Cavalry Regiment crossing a Romanian river on a Soviet-built tactical bridge assembled by the Romanian Army, while overhead Vietnam-era MiG 21s carried out mock attacks, with German-made antiaircraft guns manned by Romanian crews simulating the destruction of the intruding MiGs.

The symbolism of the river crossing brought home to me the precarious condition of the U.S. military presence in Europe. American armor crossed on Romanian bridges because the Army has no tactical bridging in Europe. Romanian antiaircraft guns at the crossing sites highlighted the fact that our Army has no mid- and low-level antiaircraft weapons to protect America's ground forces in Europe.

The Second Cavalry's lightly armored Stryker vehicles that crossed on Romanian bridges worked well in Afghanistan against the Taliban. But they would turn into burning coffins when confronting Russian tanks. Numbers tell an even more frightening story: At 30,000, there are fewer American soldiers protecting Western Europe, a piece of the planet that produces 46% of global GDP, than there are cops in New York City.

On Oct. 27, the day after the crossing, I attended the annual Conference of European Armies in Wiesbaden, Germany. The event brought together 26 NATO nations and 10 affiliated European nations including Ukraine, Georgia, Romania and Albania. The military chiefs of these ""partner"" nations universally feared intrusion by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his military. After Russia's excursions in Georgia and Ukraine, every European military fears further Russian aggression.

Virtually all the nations at the conference are tightly bonded by the shared experience of Afghanistan. Most had sacrificed soldiers to support the American-led conflict. Tiny Georgia contributed two companies that suffered 30 killed and more than 300 wounded. Many of all ranks had served together. The U.S. Army commander in Europe, General Ben Hodges, had fought under both a German and a Danish commander. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley greeted many NATO and affiliated army leaders whom he had known and served with in Afghanistan. The question heard throughout the conference was: What will Putin do next?

They all agreed that, thanks to two years of enormous sacrifice by the Ukrainian Army, Mr. Putin is not anxious to restart his march through Ukraine to the Black Sea. Russia's costly military commitment in Ukraine may well be one motive behind Mr. Putin's dispatch of Russian soldiers and materiel to Syria. The consensus among all present was that Mr. Putin's most dangerous and perhaps most likely next move will be against the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

From a Russian perspective the geography of the region would make aggression there possible. Russia has the advantage of ""interior lines"" in the Baltic, meaning that Mr. Putin can move units to threaten the Baltics much faster than the U.S. and NATO can respond. The Russian enclave of Kaliningrad is the most heavily armed oblast, or province, in its erstwhile empire. It contains three Russian armored brigades, a huge naval base, several airfields and is loaded with the same electronic spying and spoofing materiel used against the Ukrainians.

Kaliningrad is a Russian wedge between Poland and Lithuania and is only a 95 kilometer tank ride from the Russian military protectorate of Belarus across the Suwalki Gap. In a single day a Russian column could move from the southern border of Belarus across the extreme southern tip of Lithuania and effectively cut off the Baltics from the rest of NATO. Russia's antiship missiles and ships berthed in Kaliningrad would very quickly cut all sea communications routes to the Baltic states and in so doing trap the three small American light infantry companies currently training Baltic armies.

What should NATO do to deter such a move? Put heavy-armored American ground units into Eastern Europe within marching distance of the Baltics. Position a heavy-armored brigade in each Baltic state and two in neighboring Poland. All but two of the American brigades might be limited to prepositioned brigade ""sets"" of materiel in Europe with troops stationed in the U.S.

A quick-reaction force of dedicated Air Force cargo aircraft alerted immediately for the mission could move all these soldiers to Europe in less than a week. These forward-based brigades would be reinforced with supporting units that have proven essential in recent wars, to include heavy artillery and rockets, drones, attack helicopters, intelligence, electronic warfare units and sufficient ammunition and fuel to keep the force in the fight for weeks.

Moving existing materiel to Europe wouldn't require a single new weapons program or any increase in existing manpower. From what I witnessed first hand I strongly believe that such a force properly positioned would create a deterrent sufficiently intimidating to keep Mr. Putin in his cage for a very long time.",8,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,72,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444

Vigorous use of the airpower we already have in the region is the most logical and straightforward next step for doing so.","President Obama's desire to avoid large new ground commitments in the Middle East is, in many respects, understandable, given the experiences of some 15 years of war. At present, however, the modest number of U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan operate with one hand tied behind their backs - at a time when Afghan forces, though fighting hard, are struggling. That should be changed. We should unleash our airpower in support of our Afghan partners in the same way that we support our Iraqi and Syrian partners against extremists.

At present, U.S. and NATO airpower in Afghanistan is used only to attack validated al-Qaeda targets, to counter specific individuals or groups who have attacked coalition forces previously and to respond directly to attacks on coalition forces. According to leaders on the ground, U.S. and NATO forces are otherwise not allowed to attack Taliban targets. The situation appears to be in flux in regard to Islamic State elements, but through 2015, they too could be targeted only under narrow circumstances.

The origins of this contorted policy are, once again, somewhat understandable, even if the policy itself should be changed. When he was Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai frequently objected to NATO's use of firepower, especially when tragic accidents took the lives of Afghan civilians. Though this war has probably involved the most carefully controlled airpower in the history of warfare, with NATO troops taking extraordinary measures to protect innocents, mistakes inevitably occurred. Karzai's accumulated frustration led him to increasingly react to such tragedies not just with private outrage but also public excoriation. At times, the mission's future hung in the balance. To minimize such friction, while also prodding Afghans to view the fight against the Taliban more as their own and less as ours, Obama decided to end NATO targeting of the Taliban in most situations.

Also, some administration lawyers harbor concerns that the authorization for the use of military force approved soon after 9/11 does not extend to justify the continued use of force against the Taliban. That is logic we believe unfounded; after all, it was the Taliban that allowed al-Qaeda the sanctuary it used to plan the fateful attacks 15 years ago. In addition, the Taliban, in cahoots with the Haqqani network and other extremist elements, is trying to overthrow the very Afghan government that is now committed to keeping al-Qaeda and the Islamic State at bay.

We have the tools in place to step up our game considerably. When combined with a motivated and competent ground force, airpower can be quite effective. This was witnessed in 2001, when U.S. airpower and special operatives worked with the Northern Alliance to oust the Taliban from power. It was seen on a vast scale while supporting coalition and host- nation forces in Iraq and Afghanistan - increasing in effectiveness, in fact, as the fleet of drones and other precision-strike assets expanded dramatically over the course of the ""surges"" in each war. It has also been seen of late in Iraq and Syria, where U.S. airpower collaborated with Kurdish forces and other partners in both countries to prevent further inroads by the Islamic State in 2014 and then to liberate places such as Sinjar and Ramadi in Iraq and a number of villages near Kobani in Syria last year.

In Syria and Iraq, U.S. and coalition airpower has been used increasingly vigorously. In 2014, coalition aircraft dropped ordnance during about 2,000 aircraft sorties; that number grew above 9,000 last year.

But we have moved in the opposite direction in Afghanistan. Even though our military footprint there is more firmly established, with nearly 10,000 U.S. troops and 6,000 other foreign troops , and with several major airfields accessible to NATO forces in country, ordnance was dropped during only about 400 sorties last year. The corresponding tally for 2014 was about 1,100; in 2010, it was about 2,500.

The Taliban is not winning decisively in Afghanistan by any means, but it has learned that it can mass for attack in many places without fear of NATO airstrikes. Partly as a result, it temporarily took control of the provincial capital of Kunduz in the fall; more recently it has taken large swaths of Helmand province, as well as a number of places in the country's mountainous east.

We do not need a big U.S. troop buildup in Afghanistan, but we should take the gloves off of those who are there. Afghan forces are doing perhaps 99 percent of the fighting on the ground, and that is as it should be - though as the tragic recent casualties in Helmand and near Bagram Airfield reminded us, Americans are certainly still in the fight.

The development of the Afghan air force will take a least a few more years. In the meantime, we can and should do more to ensure that the Taliban does not win the war, which could lead to new sanctuaries for al-Qaeda and the Islamic State on the eastern flank of their broader area of operations. Vigorous use of the airpower we already have in the region is the most logical and straightforward next step for doing so.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Schwartz, Norton and Stavridis, James",2013,1,2016-02-04,,1,0,WSJ,Air Force and Navy,,,M,A Quick Fix for the U.S. Icebreaker Gap,"We agree with Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who said last year: ""Do we need icebreakers? Yes. Did we need them yesterday? Yes."" While we wait for a new fleet to be built and launched, leasing can help the U.S. meet its obligations to the safety and protection of the Arctic.","New U.S. icebreakers, the ships that ""pave"" sea lanes in the frigid polar regions, may soon be on the way. Last fall President Obama accelerated plans to buy at least one heavy icebreaker, moving the target from 2022 up to 2020. Now the U.S. Coast Guard has released requirements and an acquisition timeline for two such ships.

Nearly everyone in Washington agrees that the Arctic region is more important, commercially and strategically, than ever. The rub lies in the funding. Each heavy icebreaker is expected to cost around $1 billion. We are optimistic the administration will allocate sufficient funds in its 2017 budget. But given the stormy budget climate on Capitol Hill, there are no guarantees. And even with two new icebreakers, the U.S. will only have four active icebreakers in its fleet. Russia has 42, with another 12 planned or under construction.

Even in the best budget climate the acquisition process is painfully slow, and it could take decades to bridge the ""icebreaker gap."" Meanwhile, the U.S. government should explore private leasing mechanisms.

In a ""dry lease,"" a private owner builds the vessel and contracts it out for a specified term to the government, which then mans and operates it. In a ""wet lease,"" the owner builds the vessel but also provides the crew: Operations and maintenance costs are built into the contract.

Wet-lease arrangements aren't uncommon in shipping. Oil companies lease specially designed shuttle tankers, owned and operated by shipping companies, to transport crude from offshore platforms to dry land. These vessels are expensive, costing about $200 million each to build. So oil companies lease them instead, at rates of roughly $50,000 a day depending on tanker size and market fluctuations. Long contracts for up to 12 years provide shipping companies sufficient incentive to participate.

Such arrangements also exist in aviation. One example is Omega Air Refueling Services, which operates three specially modified planes that conduct air-to-air refueling for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Omega's aircraft, under a wet lease, are operated and maintained by company personnel on an hourly basis pursuant to a sole-source contract, for which Omega bears the risk of performance.

Similar leases could be drawn up for heavy icebreakers. This would help meet the government's needs much more quickly than the traditional acquisition process. One wrinkle is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, better known as the Jones Act, which requires waterborne commerce between U.S. ports to be conducted by U.S.-made ships with American ownership and crews. But leased icebreakers could stay within the law if the contracts are carefully designed -- for instance, if they include a cap on the number of days a year the icebreaker may service U.S. commercial entities.

We agree with Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who said last year: ""Do we need icebreakers? Yes. Did we need them yesterday? Yes.""

''They'' are Qaeda operatives who have been planning
attacks against the United States.
''Yes, sir,'' the intelligence analyst replies, ticking off the human and electronic sources of information. ''We've got
good Humint. We've been tracking with streaming video. Sigint's checking in now and confirming it's them. They're
there.''
The decision maker asks if there are civilians nearby.
''The family is in the main building. The guys we want are in the big guesthouse here.''
''They're not very far apart.''
''Far enough.''
''Anyone in that little building now?''
''Don't know. Probably not. We haven't seen anyone since the Pred got capture of the target. But A.Q. uses it
when they pass through here, and they pass through here a lot.''
He asks the probability of killing the targets if they use a GBU-12, a powerful 500-pound, laser-guided bomb.
''These guys are sure dead,'' comes the reply. ''We think the family's O.K.''
''You think they're O.K.?''
''They should be.'' But the analyst confesses it is impossible to be sure.
''What's it look like with a couple of Hellfires?'' the decision maker asks, referring to smaller weapons carrying 20-
pound warheads.
''If we hit the right room in the guesthouse, we'll get the all bad guys.'' But the walls of the house could be thick.
The family's safe, but bad guys might survive.
''Use the Hellfires the way you said,'' the decision maker says.
Then a pause.

''Tell me again about these guys.''
''Sir, big A.Q. operators. We've been trying to track them forever. They're really careful. They've been hard to find.
They're the first team.''
Another pause. A long one.
''Use the GBU. And that small building they sometimes use as a dorm ...''
''Yes, sir.''
''After the GBU hits, if military-age males come out ...''
''Yes, sir?''
''Kill them.''
Less than an hour later he is briefed again. The two targets are dead. The civilians have fled the compound. All
are alive.
TARGETED killing using drones has become part of the American way of war. To do it legally and effectively
requires detailed and accurate intelligence. It also requires some excruciatingly difficult decisions. The dialogue
above, representative of many such missions, shows how hard the commanders and analysts work to get it right.
The longer they have gone on, however, the more controversial drone strikes have become. Critics assert that a
high percentage of the people killed in drone strikes are civilians -- a claim totally at odds with the intelligence I have
reviewed -- and that the strikes have turned the Muslim world against the United States, fueling terrorist recruitment.
Political elites have joined in, complaining that intelligence agencies have gone too far -- until they have felt in
danger, when they have complained that the agencies did not go far enough.
The program is not perfect. No military program is. But here is the bottom line: It works. I think it fair to say that the
targeted killing program has been the most precise and effective application of firepower in the history of armed
conflict. It disrupted terrorist plots and reduced the original Qaeda organization along the Afghanistan-Pakistan
border to a shell of its former self. And that was well before Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011.
Not many years before, the targeted killings were fairly limited. But by 2008, we knew that the terrorist threat had
increased to intolerable levels, both to American forces in South Asia and to the United States itself. From our
surveillance platforms, we could observe training camps where men leapt off motorbikes and fired on simulated
targets. Early that year, the C.I.A. and I began recommending more aggressive action.
We were confident that the intelligence was good enough to sustain a campaign of very precise attacks. To be
sure, it was not, is not, always error-free. In late 2006, for instance, a strike killed a one-legged man we believed
was a chieftain in the Haqqani network, a violent and highly effective group allied with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. It
turned out that the man was indeed affiliated with the Haqqanis, but he wasn't the leader we wanted. With all the
land mines in the region, there were many one-legged terrorists in South Asia.
I demanded a full explanation for the misidentification. There were no excuses. People were thoroughly, maybe
even excessively, contrite.
But even if I was convinced that we could routinely provide high-quality intelligence to enable precision targeting,
we still had to convince policy makers in the government that they should take advantage of it.
We had one thing going for us. I got to talk to President George W. Bush directly every week without filters. I
briefed him every Thursday morning and began to use the sessions to underscore Al Qaeda's growing footprint and
brazenness in the tribal region of Pakistan. My chief analyst on this, a lanky Notre Dame graduate, met with me
Page 3 of 5
The Case for Drones
almost daily and stressed that as bad as this might be for Afghanistan and our forces there, the threat could also
come to our shores.
If we had boiled our briefings down, the essence would have been: ''Knowing what we know, there will be no
explaining our inaction after the next attack.''
So the United States began to test some limits. In early 2008, a charismatic Qaeda operations chief was killed
along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The strike was clean and the target so important that even regional reaction
was muted. Local people knew who he was and did not mourn his passing.
Later in the year another senior Qaeda operative, active in planning attacks in the West, was killed along with
several lieutenants in a similar strike that resulted in a similar reaction.
By midsummer, when Hellfire missiles killed a senior Qaeda operator who was active in its weapons of mass
destruction program, it was clear that the United States had launched a campaign of targeted killings in South Asia.
Publicly available sources document nearly three dozen attacks in the last seven months of the Bush
administration, almost three times the total of the previous four years. According to those sources, 18 senior and
midlevel Taliban and Qaeda leaders were killed.
The intelligence used for these strikes was based on human reports, surveillance technology and the near
unblinking stare of the Predator itself. The strikes were particularly damaging to Al Qaeda's operational leaders,
who couldn't afford to hunker down like Bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, whose main contribution to
the movement was pretty much just staying alive. Those front-line operators had to move and communicate -- and
that made them vulnerable.
Other attacks were intended to disrupt known Qaeda locations and activities even when the identities of the
people present were not known. Critics said these so-called signature strikes were indiscriminate. They were not.
Intelligence for signature strikes always had multiple threads and deep history. The data was near encyclopedic.
Many such strikes killed high-value targets whose presence was suspected but not certain. And we made no
excuses about killing lower-ranking terrorists. The United States viewed these attacks as legitimate acts of war
against an armed enemy -- and in warfare it is regrettably necessary to kill foot soldiers, too.
The signature strikes drastically shrank the enemy's bench and made the leadership worry that they had no safe
havens. Almost inadvertently, these strikes also helped protect intelligence sources and methods since the strikes
seemed more random than they actually were.
It wasn't long before intelligence reporting began to confirm our success. We learned there was a widespread
sense of helplessness among the Qaeda leadership. Years later, documents proved just how anguished they were.
In 2015, an American court case against a Qaeda member prompted the government to release eight documents
from the trove of Bin Laden letters captured when he was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011. Bin Laden's
correspondence with his chief lieutenants, in 2010, is remarkable in its candor.
The letters show the stress within the organization. ''I convey my condolences regarding our great brother Sheikh
Sa'id'' who died ''as a martyr during a spy plane attack,'' read one from June 2010.
''The strikes by the spy planes are still going on,'' it continued. A member named al-Sa'di Ihsanullah was the ''latest
to become a martyr: He was killed about a week ago, also by air raids.'' It noted, ''The midlevel commands and staff
members are hurt by the killings.''
Signature strikes were also taking a toll. In November, the same Bin Laden lieutenant complained, after 20 fighters
were killed in one place on Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim feast celebrating the end of Ramadan, that the men had
''gathered for the holidays, despite our orders.''
Page 4 of 5
The Case for Drones
Al Qaeda gained a healthy respect for American intelligence. ''Based on our analysis, they are constantly
monitoring several potential or possibly confirmed targets,'' the June letter said.
The frightened underlings in the field beseeched Bin Laden to help. ''We would like your guidance,'' the June letter
said. ''Especially on this idea: reduce the work, meaning stopping many of the operations so we can move around
less, and be less exposed to strikes.''
''There is an idea preferred by some brothers to avoid attrition,'' it continued. ''The idea is that some brothers will
travel to some 'safe' areas with their families, just for protection. They would only stay for a time, until the crisis is
over, maybe one or two years.''
Two months later another Bin Laden deputy agreed to their taking refuge and ''calming down and minimizing
movement.''
All this correspondence was from 2010, but it is consistent with the intelligence picture we were gathering in 2008.
Al Qaeda along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border was spending more time worrying about its own survival than
planning how to threaten ours.
The correspondence also confirmed our intelligence showing that attacking Americans on American soil was
central to their plotting.
The letters are filled with references to recruits from a host of countries, including the United States. One
correspondence emphasized that ''operations inside America are some of the most important work of the
Organization, as long as they are possible, because they affect the security and economy of the American people
as a whole.''
Throughout the campaign, civilian casualties were a constant concern. In one strike, the grandson of the target
was sleeping near him on a cot outside, trying to keep cool in the summer heat. The Hellfire missiles were directed
so that their energy and fragments splayed away from him and toward his grandfather. They did, but not enough.
The target was hard to locate and people were risking their lives to find him. The United States took the shot. A
child died, and we deeply regret that he did. But his grandfather had a garage full of dangerous chemicals, and he
intended to use them, perhaps on Americans.
We tried to get better. Carefully reviewing video of one successful strike, we could discern -- as a GBU was
already hurtling toward an arms cache -- a frightened woman responding to another weapon that had just
detonated. She was running with young children square into the path of the incoming bomb, and they were killed.
We realized, once our after-action review was done, that we needed to put even more eyes on targets as they were
being struck to try to avoid any future civilian casualties.
For my part, the United States needs not only to maintain this capacity, but also to be willing to use it. Radical
Islamism thrives in many corners of the world -- Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Mali, the list goes on --
where governments cannot or will not act. In some of these instances, the United States must.
And unmanned aerial vehicles carrying precision weapons and guided by powerful intelligence offer a proportional
and discriminating response when response is necessary. Civilians have died, but in my firm opinion, the death toll
from terrorist attacks would have been much higher if we had not taken action.

"Krepinevich, Andrew",,1,2016-02-22,,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Overhauling the US Army for the Age of Irregular Warfare,"There are ways the Army can address the persistent threat of modern irregular warfare without returning to a draft, which is neither politically feasible nor necessary. It involves investing in better training of allies and partners, in unmanned systems and in special forces. The administration needs to do a better job of identifying partners and supporting its allies in these conflicts.","On Jan. 29, the National Commission on the Future of the U.S. Army released its report on a wide range of issues confronting the Army. Its more than 60 recommendations addressed details as specific as the proper ratio of attack-helicopter battalions between the active Army and the Reserves. Yet for all its good work, the commission neglected to tackle the Army's biggest problem: its declining ability to wage the kind of protracted irregular wars that America's enemies increasingly prefer to fight.

The roots of this problem lie chiefly in the social choice the American people made following the Vietnam War to abolish the draft and field the military entirely with volunteers. That decision has become so expensive that it now threatens to limit U.S. defense options.

The shift to a volunteer force seemed logical at the time. A Cold War Army of volunteers would stand guard in Europe and Korea to deter aggression. In the event war came, the National Guard and Reserves would be mobilized and the draft reinstated if necessary. Following the Iraq war that began in 2003, however, the Army found itself in protracted conflicts against irregular forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. These are the new ""Vietnams"" the Army's civilian masters said it didn't need to plan for again.

It turns out there is a big difference between attracting volunteers for service in the peacetime Army as opposed to one that sends its soldiers on repeated combat tours. To maintain the numbers of soldiers needed for these wars, compensation had to be increased and the risk of casualties reduced. Since 9/11, the Army's personnel costs have increased, on a per-soldier basis, by over 50% after adjusting for inflation.

The Army has also taken unprecedented steps to reduce casualties. For example, it has spent more than $40 billion since 9/11 on heavily armored vehicles, and nearly $20 billion on other ways -- such as detection and defusing methods -- to reduce the threat of roadside bombs.

Providing protections for soldiers is only going to get harder. Developing and fielding improved vehicle armor to protect soldiers against roadside bombs takes months or years to accomplish. Yet our enemies have consistently found ways -- such as simply emplacing larger bombs -- to defeat these improvements far more quickly and cheaply than we can counter them. Enemies like al Qaeda in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan are daunting enough. But they have nothing like the firepower possessed by terrorist groups like the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which has tens of thousands of rockets, missiles, mortars and artillery munitions.

The Obama administration's response to this challenge has been to reprise ""No More Vietnams."" Hence the president ordered the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and major force reductions in Afghanistan, and has directed the Pentagon not to size the Army for these kinds of wars.

But to paraphrase Trotsky: While the U.S. may not be interested in irregular warfare, our enemies are. Iran has increased its support of its proxies in the Middle East. Moscow has employed its own proxies to annex Crimea and seize chunks of eastern Ukraine. ISIS has emerged from the power vacuum created by the Army's withdrawal from Iraq, while the Taliban are resurgent in Afghanistan as the U.S. Army's footprint there fades.

The administration has now curtailed the drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan. But it isn't clear that the small residual force will be able to do much more than defend itself -- thus becoming what the military refers to as a ""self-licking ice cream cone."" Nor is it clear what a handful of U.S. Special Forces troops can accomplish in the Middle East.

There are ways the Army can address the persistent threat of modern irregular warfare without returning to a draft, which is neither politically feasible nor necessary. It involves investing in better training of allies and partners, in unmanned systems and in special forces. The administration needs to do a better job of identifying partners and supporting its allies in these conflicts. Spending $500 million to field a few Syrian freedom fighters against Bashar Assad does not square with the president's injunction to avoid doing ""stupid stuff."" The Kurds, though, have proven to be reliable and effective partners. They deserve more support, and we should look for similar partners to assist. Fortunately Gen. Mark Milley, the Army's new chief of staff, is exploring creating specially designed training and advisory brigades for this purpose.

Second, the Army must leverage technology. As the Air Force's use of remotely piloted drones has shown, rapid advances are being made in the area of artificial intelligence and robotics. The Army needs to exploit these technologies.

During the Korean and Vietnam wars the Army sought to minimize casualties by substituting firepower for manpower whenever possible. Increasingly the Army will need to send in the ""droids"" instead of soldiers whenever possible.

Finally, the Army must concentrate on protecting the size and readiness of its special-operations forces, preserving these high-quality forces to offset the effects of a continuing 20% cut in the active Army's size that began in 2012 and should be completed in 2019.

Our enemies are pursuing an effective strategy, creating irregular-warfare forces to exploit our weakness in this form of warfare. The proper response to this challenge is not to abandon the field to our enemies, but to develop our unique advantages and leverage them in ways that transform our weaknesses into a strength.",6,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Blair, Dennis and Hornung, Jeffrey",2002,1,2016-03-03,,1,0,WaPO,Navy,,,M,China's Self-Defeating Provocations,"There are two well-founded concerns about the Chinese action: timing and precedent.

They are the latest in a line of closely spaced Chinese actions that undercut and contradict Beijing's soothing words about their aims.

China's provocative act is being portrayed as a watershed indicator that it is bent on military dominance of the South China Sea.

It is important to understand the facts and history to identify the true concerns.

First, facts and history: Satellite images of Woody Island in the Paracels from early February showed the HQ-9 air defense system deployed there for the first time. Woody Island is in the northern section of the South China Sea. It is about 250 miles southeast of Hainan Island and 500 miles north of the Spratly Islands that China has enlarged by land reclamation. Unlike the Spratly Islands, which are contested by multiple states, the Paracel Islands are claimed by only China (and Taiwan) and Vietnam. Woody Island itself has been controlled by Beijing for decades and has been heavily built up with civilian and military structures. In any impartial arbitration, China would have a strong claim to this island.

Woody Island has long been home to surveillance radars, an airfield and shelters for military aircraft. Late last year, China deployed advanced jets there and it has apparently done so again in the past few days. According to U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Adm. Scott Swift, this is at least the third time that antiaircraft missiles have been deployed to Woody Island, although previous deployments were of less advanced systems. On the previous occasions, these deployments were part of exercises, which may or may not be the case in this instance.

Last year during his visit to Washington, President Xi Jinping stated that China did not intend to militarize the islands it had enlarged in the Spratlys. The missile and aircraft deployments to Woody Island do not violate that pledge.

These deployments do not in themselves affect any of the important U.S. interests in the South China Sea: They do not increase the threat to U.S. freedom of navigation and flight; they do not bring another island under China's control by non-peaceful means; they do not threaten international shipping in the sea; they do not protect Woody Island from destruction by the United States during a military crisis or conflict.

So why all the concern?

There are two well-founded concerns about the Chinese action: timing and precedent. First, timing: Whether the air-defense and jet-fighter deployments are a long-planned exercise or the beginning of a permanent presence, they belie China's professed commitment to peaceful solutions to conflicting claims in the region. They are the latest in a line of closely spaced Chinese actions that undercut and contradict Beijing's soothing words about their aims. Countries with peaceful intentions do not enlarge islands with military-capable airfields, harbors and logistics facilities at a breakneck pace in one part of the South China Sea, then deploy advanced missiles and jets to another part. Second, precedent: If China conducts deployments like this to the islands it has enlarged with runways in the Spratlys, it will violate Xi's pledge and introduce an air control capability that ratchets up the military stakes in an area of the South China Sea far from China's borders.

There is a final point that all the excited commentary misses. These deployments and the reaction to them throughout Southeast Asia highlight the self-defeating aspects of China's aggressive policies. By its small-scale tactical military deployments on indefensible islands in the South China Sea, China is antagonizing all the other littoral countries, which are building their own defenses and turning to the United States and Japan to offer access to their ports and airfields, to increase military cooperation and to request additional security assistance. China's strategic position in the region is much weaker now than it was six years ago, before it embarked on its truculent and aggressive policies. Meanwhile, to the north, China is unable to restrain its client North Korea. The result is to solidify South Korean, U.S. and Japanese policies and cooperation.

Finally, China's economy is sliding. China looks less like a shrewd, confident and successful regional power bent on hegemony and more like a flailing and blustering collection of bureaucrats continuing short-term, outmoded policies to the detriment of their country's larger interests.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Petraeus, David",2011,1,2016-04-17,,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,5 Big Ideas to Guide Us in the Long War,"The Long War is going to be an ultramarathon, and it is time we recognized that. But we and our partners have the ability to respond in a thoughtful, prudent manner, informed by the big ideas that I have described. Nothing less will prove adequate.","The formulation of sound national policy requires finding the right overarching concepts. Getting the ""big ideas"" right is particularly important when major developments appear to have invalidated the concepts upon which previous policy and strategy were based - which now appears to be the case in the wake of the Arab Spring.

To illustrate this point, I have often noted that the surge that mattered most in Iraq was not the surge of forces. It was the surge of ideas, which guided the strategy that ultimately reduced violence in the country so substantially.

The biggest of the big ideas that guided the Iraq surge included recognition that:

* The decisive terrain was the human terrain - and that securing the people had to be our foremost task. Without progress on that, nothing else would be possible.

* We could secure the people only by living with them, locating our forces in their neighborhoods, rather than consolidating on big bases, as we had been doing the year before the surge.

* We could not kill or capture our way out of the sizable insurgency that plagued Iraq; rather, though killing and capturing were necessary, we needed to reconcile with as many of the insurgent rank and file as was possible.

* We could not clear areas of insurgents and then leave them after handing control off to Iraqi security forces; rather, we had to clear and hold, transitioning to Iraqis only when we achieved a situation that they could sustain.

Now, nine tough years later, five big ideas seem to be crystallizing as the lessons we should be taking from developments over the past decade.

First, it is increasingly apparent that ungoverned spaces in a region stretching from West Africa through the Middle East and into Central Asia will be exploited by Islamic extremists who want to establish sanctuaries in which they can enforce their extremist version of Islam and from which they can conduct terrorist attacks.

Second, it is also apparent that the attacks and other activities of such extremists will not be confined to the areas or regions in which they are located. Rather, as in the case of Syria, the actions of the extremist groups are likely to spew instability, extremism, violence and refugees far beyond their immediate surroundings, posing increasingly difficult challenges for our partners in the region, our European allies and even our homeland.

Third, it is also increasingly clear that, in responding to these challenges, U.S. leadership is imperative. If the United States does not lead, it is unlikely that another country will. Moreover, at this point, no group of other countries can collectively approach U.S. capabilities. This does not mean that the United States needs to undertake enormous efforts to counter extremist groups in each case. To the contrary, the United States should do only what is absolutely necessary, and we should do so with as many partners as possible. Churchill was right when he observed, ""There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them."" And, if one of those partners wants to walk point - such as France in Mali - we should support it, while recognizing that we still may have to contribute substantially.

Partners from the Islamic world are of particular importance. Indeed, they have huge incentives to be involved, as the ongoing struggles are generally not clashes between civilizations. Rather, what we are seeing is more accurately a clash within a civilization, that of the Islamic world. And no leaders have more to lose should extremism gather momentum than those of predominantly Islamic states.

Fourth, it is becoming clear that the path the United States and coalition partners pursue has to be comprehensive and not just a narrow counter-terrorism approach. It is increasingly apparent that more than precision strikes and special operations raids are needed. This does not mean that the United States has to provide the conventional ground forces, conduct the political reconciliation component or undertake the nation-building tasks necessary in such cases. In Iraq at present, for example, it is clear that the Iraqis not only should provide those components, but also that they have to do so for the results achieved - with considerable help from the U.S.-led coalition - to be sustainable.

Fifth, and finally, it is clear that the U.S.-led effort will have to be sustained for what may be extended periods of time - and that reductions in our level of effort should be guided by conditions on the ground rather than fixed timetables. While aspirational timelines for reductions in our efforts may have some merit, it is clear from our experiences under both post-9/11 administrations that premature transitions and drawdowns can result in loss of the progress for which we sacrificed greatly - and may result in having to return to a country to avoid a setback to U.S. interests.

To be sure, there is nothing easy about what I describe. Success in all such efforts will require sustained commitment, not just of our military forces, but also of the capabilities of other departments and agencies.

A comprehensive approach is neither easy nor cheap. But that is also true of the actions we have to take as inadequately governed spaces become ungoverned and in turn are exploited by transnational extremists.

The Long War is going to be an ultramarathon, and it is time we recognized that. But we and our partners have the ability to respond in a thoughtful, prudent manner, informed by the big ideas that I have described. Nothing less will prove adequate.

"Petraeus, David",2011,1,2016-05-15,,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Anti-Muslim Bigotry Aids Islamist Terrorists,"Demonizing a religious faith and its adherents not only runs contrary to our most cherished and fundamental values as a country; it is also corrosive to our vital national security interests and, ultimately, to the United States' success in this war. ","Almost 15 years after the 9/11 attacks, and five years since the killing of the chief architect of those attacks, the United States and the world face a resurgent threat from terrorism. This stark reality should inform the national debate as we prepare to elect our next commander in chief.

As states across the Middle East have collapsed into civil war, Islamist extremist groups such as the Islamic State have exploited the upheaval to seize vast swaths of territory, which they have used to rally recruits, impose totalitarian rule over the people trapped in these areas and plot attacks against the rest of the world.

Few responsibilities that our next president inherits will be more urgent, important or complex than thwarting these terrorist plans, reversing the conditions that have enabled their rise and combating the broader Islamist extremist ideology that animates them.

It would be a mistake to minimize the continuing risk posed by these groups. Although al-Qaeda's senior leadership ranks have been dramatically reduced, and while encouraging progress is being made against the Islamic State in Iraq and, to a lesser degree, Syria, these remain resilient and adaptive organizations. While Islamist extremist networks do not pose an ""existential"" threat to the United States in the way that Soviet nuclear weapons once did, their bloodlust and their ambition to inflict genocidal violence make them uniquely malevolent actors on the world stage.

Nor can they be ""contained."" On the contrary, from Afghanistan before 9/11 to Syria and Libya today, history shows that, once these groups are allowed to establish a haven, they will inevitably use it to project instability and violence.

Moreover, the fact is that free and open societies such as ours depend on a sense of basic security to function. If terrorism succeeds in puncturing that, it can threaten the very fabric of our democracy - which is, indeed, a central element of the terrorist strategy.

For that reason, I have grown increasingly concerned about inflammatory political discourse that has become far too common both at home and abroad against Muslims and Islam, including proposals from various quarters for blanket discrimination against people on the basis of their religion.

Some justify these measures as necessary to keep us safe - dismissing any criticism as ""political correctness."" Others play down such divisive rhetoric as the excesses of political campaigns here and in Europe, which will fade away after the elections are over.

I fear that neither is true; in fact, the ramifications of such rhetoric could be very harmful - and lasting.

As policy, these concepts are totally counterproductive: Rather than making our country safer, they will compound the already grave terrorist danger to our citizens. As ideas, they are toxic and, indeed, non-biodegradable - a kind of poison that, once released into our body politic, is not easily expunged.

Setting aside moral considerations, those who flirt with hate speech against Muslims should realize they are playing directly into the hands of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The terrorists' explicit hope has been to try to provoke a clash of civilizations - telling Muslims that the United States is at war with them and their religion. When Western politicians propose blanket discrimination against Islam, they bolster the terrorists' propaganda.

At the same time, such statements directly undermine our ability to defeat Islamist extremists by alienating and undermining the allies whose help we most need to win this fight: namely, Muslims.

During the surge in Iraq, we were able to roll back the tide of al-Qaeda and associated insurgents because we succeeded in mobilizing Iraqis - especially Sunni Arabs - to join us in fighting against the largely Sunni extremist networks in their midst. Later, we took on the Iranian-backed Shiite militia, with the important support of the Shiite- majority Iraqi security forces.

Likewise, the rapid ouster of the Taliban regime after 9/11 was made possible by our partnership with Muslim fighters of the Afghan Northern Alliance. And in Southeast Asia, it was by working with the government of Indonesia - the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world - that Jemaah Islamiah, once one of al-Qaeda's most capable affiliates, was routed.

The good news is that today, hundreds of thousands of Muslims are fighting to defeat the terrorists who wish to kill us all. This includes brave Afghan soldiers fighting the Islamic State and the Taliban, as well as Persian Gulf forces in Yemen battling both Iranian-backed Houthis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And it includes Arab and Kurdish forces who are battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In fact, we should do more to support these partners of ours.

Inescapably, clearing territory of entrenched terrorist networks and then holding it takes boots on the ground. The question is - whether in Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Nigeria or Mali - do the bulk of those boots need to be our own or those of local Muslim partners?

I fear that those who demonize and denigrate Islam make it more likely that it will be our own men and women who ultimately have to shoulder more of this fight - at greater cost in dollars and lives.

We should also acknowledge that patriotic Muslim Americans in our intelligence agencies and armed forces - many of them immigrants or children of immigrants - have been vital assets in this fight with radical Islam.

It has also been through building ties of trust and cooperation between law enforcement and Muslim communities in the United States that we form our most effective defense against homegrown radicalization and lone-wolf attacks.

Again, none of this is to deny or diminish the reality that we are at war with Islamist extremism - a fanatical ideology based on a twisted interpretation of Islam. Nor is it to minimize the need for smart, intelligence-driven measures to prevent terrorists from infiltrating our borders and exploiting our immigration policies.

But it is precisely because the danger of Islamist extremism is so great that politicians here and abroad who toy with anti-Muslim bigotry must consider the effects of their rhetoric. Demonizing a religious faith and its adherents not only runs contrary to our most cherished and fundamental values as a country; it is also corrosive to our vital national security interests and, ultimately, to the United States' success in this war.

"Petraeus, David and O'Hanlon, Michael",2011,1,2016-05-21,,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Take the Gloves Off Against the Taliban,"The bottom line is simple: While we also need to keep a focus on whether U.S. and NATO forces are adequate in size for the current mission, we need to take the gloves off those forces already in-country. Air power in particular represents an asymmetric Western advantage, relatively safe to apply, and very effective against massed (or even individual) enemy forces and assets.","In any counterinsurgency campaign, foreign forces helping another country must strike a balance. They must wean local forces off their dependency on outside help as rapidly as possible. But they also must not rush the job and lose what has been gained along the way -- especially when a part of their core mission is to build up the indigenous police and military forces to which they seek to pass the baton.

For 10 years U.S. leaders have understood the need for this delicate balancing act in Iraq and Afghanistan, though both the Bush and Obama administrations did, in certain cases, hand off to indigenous forces and draw down more rapidly than was advisable. We are at risk of doing that again now in Afghanistan.

The immediate issue is how we are using American and broader NATO air power. There is a great deal of it -- many dozens of combat aircraft at bases from Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the south to the cities of Khost and Jalalabad in the east to the capital region of Kabul and points north. But we continue to handcuff those deploying these jets, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles. Existing U.S. and NATO policy generally allows them to strike targets on the ground only when hostile forces can be identified as al Qaeda or ISIS loyalists, when they pose an imminent threat to NATO personnel, or, reportedly, when a strategic collapse is imminent.

The rules of engagement mean that the indigenous Afghan and Pakistani Taliban generally get a pass. Yet it was the Taliban that allowed al Qaeda the sanctuary in Afghanistan in which the 9/11 attacks were planned, and which presumably would make the Taliban a legitimate target under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force.

And it is the Taliban that now seek to overthrow the unity government of President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. They seek as well to jettison the progress in education and human rights that has been achieved since 2001. The Taliban also aim to cut off the cooperation with the international community that Afghanistan still so badly needs to recover from a generation of war.

This is the same group that also enjoys the sworn support of al Qaeda's senior leadership -- following al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri's endorsement of the new head of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansour. And it is the same quasi-terrorist movement that, in alliance with the Haqqani network based in Pakistan, has recently carried out the horrific bombings in Kabul.

The Taliban have taken back large swaths of Helmand province and areas in eastern provinces such as Nangarhar and Kunar over the past several years. This happened after the sizable NATO troop drawdown that began in 2011 and that, by last year, had reduced the alliance's strength in Afghanistan by some 90% relative to its peak. (Total foreign forces peaked at around 150,000 uniformed personnel in early 2011 and are now down to about 15,000.) The Taliban also seized the northern city of Kunduz, Afghanistan's fifth largest, for a stretch last fall and may attempt a similar endeavor this year.

Yet the Taliban are not invincible. Though they took Kunduz, they were soon driven out by an Afghan-led operation. They do not hold any other major cities or major transportation arteries, though security on the ""ring road"" that connects the country's major cities is again tenuous. The Taliban are broadly despised by the majority of the Afghan people. Without the sanctuaries they enjoy in Pakistan, it is doubtful that they could mount an organized threat to the country, even if they remained -- in cahoots with drug dealers and other criminals -- a threat to individual communities and citizens.

In other words, we have a real fight on our hands in Afghanistan, but not a hopeless one. And in this context, even modest U.S. and NATO military contributions have the potential to make a considerable difference.

Which brings us to the Obama administration's policy that seeks to minimize U.S. and allied involvement in the war. Per this policy, NATO aircraft dropped only about 1,000 bombs in Afghanistan in 2015, very few against the Taliban. That was a fivefold reduction from the war's peak level of activity. So far, 2016 looks similar, with 300 bombs dropped in the first three months.

These figures stand in contrast to what we are doing in Iraq and Syria. According to Pentagon data, we dropped 6,000 bombs there in 2014, almost 30,000 in 2015, and almost 7,000 in the first three months of this year. Modern air power -- when combined with a suitable ally on the ground that can seize the advantage created by the bombing of enemy positions, camps and supply routes -- is impressive. ISIS has lost about 40% of the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria and stands to lose more.

By contrast, while exact figures are hard to come by, a reasonable unclassified estimate is that the Taliban now hold 5% to 10% more of Afghanistan -- as measured by the population under their influence -- than they did a few years ago before the drawdown of allied forces. Civilian fatalities from the continuing war in Afghanistan, while still far less than in many battle zones (including Iraq and Syria), have been moving upward as well.

Some might reasonably ask, after 15 years of war in Afghanistan, why do we need to keep at it? The answer is simple -- because Afghanistan, effectively the eastern bulwark in our broader Middle East fight against extremist forces, still matters. We went there to take away from al Qaeda the sanctuary in which the 9/11 attacks were planned. We have stayed to ensure that this remains the case.

And we also must remain for now to deny sanctuary to the nascent ISIS force in eastern Afghanistan. U.S. forces in-country today are far smaller than they were before, our casualties are relatively few, and the burden on our nation's military as well as its checkbook is far less than it once was. But that doesn't mean that we should allow the Taliban to regroup and turn back the clock on the progress.

When the international effort in Afghanistan began after 9/11, that country had been decimated by a generation of warfare in which we helped brave local fighters defeat the Soviet Union, only to see America and other Western powers desert the nation once Soviet forces were defeated and withdrawn. Thus, it is no surprise that the country, always poor and struggling even in the best of circumstances, will need more time to recover.

Bear in mind as well that for the first seven or eight years of this fight, we devoted very few American resources to the problem, even though Afghanistan didn't have a sizable army or police force of its own. We only began to build up the Afghan air force seriously in the last two years or so.

This is because forging a viable Afghan army and police force were the more urgent tasks for the NATO mission once we finally did devote substantial resources to the fight, including at the time one of us commanded that operation in 2010-11. It will take perhaps two more years for the Afghan air force, still training pilots and still receiving aircraft, to reach its intended strength.

The bottom line is simple: While we also need to keep a focus on whether U.S. and NATO forces are adequate in size for the current mission, we need to take the gloves off those forces already in-country. Air power in particular represents an asymmetric Western advantage, relatively safe to apply, and very effective against massed (or even individual) enemy forces and assets.

Simply waging the Afghanistan air-power campaign with the vigor we are employing in Iraq and Syria -- even dropping bombs at a fraction of the pace at which we are conducting attacks in those Arab states -- will very likely make much of the difference between some version of victory and defeat.

"Stavridis, James and Allen, John",2013,1,2016-06-10,,1,0,WSJ,Navy and Marine Corps,,,M,Expanding the U.S. Military's Smart-Power Toolbox,"To be clear, the Kaine amendment will not take money away from military readiness. It does not force the Pentagon to transfer funds. It does not tie the hands of combatant commanders. On the contrary, the amendment grants commanders freedom and flexibility to deploy taxpayer dollars already appropriated for combating violent extremism toward programs working to tackle its root causes. Execution of this authority would require concurrence from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and approval from Congress.","Last year the United States Africa Command, known as Africom, spotted an opportunity and took unusual action. It asked the Pentagon for approval to support a civilian government initiative that it believed would help counter the spread of violent extremist groups and keep American soldiers safer.

Africom had noticed that civilian programs led by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Agadez, Niger, were clearly reducing support for violent extremism there. Specifically, a combination of youth-development and conflict-mitigation programs were helping promote tolerance and reducing the allure of extremist violence among young people. So commanders asked to invest up to $5 million of the Pentagon's $1.3 billion 2015 Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund to scale up these USAID programs, which would cost a fraction of military operations.

But when Pentagon lawyers reviewed Africom's request, they determined that current law prevents the Defense Department from sharing the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund with USAID. The lawyers effectively said that the military didn't have the authority to deploy taxpayer dollars, already appropriated by Congress, in ways it assessed would reduce the risk to U.S. troops and make America safer.

So instead of strategically investing in a smart-power program showing promise toward reducing violent extremism, Africom purchased more military hardware for its African partners.

This needs to change. Combatant commanders need the requisite legal authority to reasonably allocate their resources so as to leverage the full capabilities of military, diplomatic and development tools in line with their mission.

To give combatant commanders this authority, Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) on Monday introduced an amendment to the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. The concise amendment would create a pilot program granting the Pentagon the authority to share funds appropriated for Pentagon security cooperation activities with USAID. The funds could then be invested in community-led programming to reduce violent extremism.

This is an idea whose time has come. The rise of these violent extremist groups is one of the greatest security threats facing the U.S. and the international community. While it is essential to continue focused military campaigns against these groups, their existence is a symptom of a greater problem: violent radicalization of thousands upon thousands of men and women living with little or no hope under corrupt regimes or in conflict-ridden states.

In the past year alone, terrorists have hit Afghanistan, Belgium, France, Iraq, Kenya, Nigeria and Turkey with deadly results. Violent extremist organizations like Islamic State, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram and the Taliban planned and carried out those attacks. They have also inspired attacks and attempts in the U.S.

While the U.S. and its allies have made progress against Islamic State, even if it were wiped out tomorrow countless others share its radical and fatalistic ideology and are prepared to rise up and kill peaceful people across the globe. Along with numerous other current and former military officials, we have said that military force alone cannot defeat these groups and eliminate the threat of violent extremism.

That's why the U.S. military needs the flexibility to use everything in the national-security toolbox -- including those tools that are rightfully in the hands of other government agencies.

To be clear, the Kaine amendment won't take money away from military readiness. It doesn't force the Pentagon to transfer funds. It doesn't tie the hands of combatant commanders. On the contrary, the amendment grants commanders freedom and flexibility to deploy taxpayer dollars already appropriated for combating violent extremism toward programs working to tackle its root causes. Execution of this authority would require concurrence from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and approval from Congress.

Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 8, Gen. David Rodriguez, commander of Africom, argued that development programs that complement security-force operations are essential to countering violent extremism and radicalism. ""If efforts are to be successful,"" he explained, the Defense Department ""must have the flexibility to transfer funds between agencies and collaborate on holistic responses to counter current and emerging threats.""

We couldn't agree more. As former senior commanders who have seen, designed and budgeted for the fight against extremism, we urge Congress to adopt this common sense amendment when it takes up debate on the National Defense Authorization Act.

Our troops cannot win this battle on their own -- and we shouldn't be asking them to. Americans face greater risks and a deadlier fight if Congress does not adopt the Kaine amendment.",10,Warfighting,1,,,,,Authors are commenting on the Kaine amendment. ,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444

In this case, one consequence of our leaders' inaction is that felons, domestic abusers and suspected terrorists have easy access to firearms.","A BATTLEFIELD on our soil.
That was my reaction on Sunday, like that of so many of my fellow Americans and fellow soldiers, as I began to
learn about the horror that unfolded early that morning in Orlando, Fla., when a dangerous man opened fire in a
nightclub with a high-powered, military-style rifle.
As Americans came together to celebrate the freedom that our great country affords and that our soldiers have
given their lives to defend, 49 of them were murdered with a gun. Scores more were injured.
But that was just part of the bloodshed in our communities this past weekend, when at least 121 people across
the country were fatally shot. The tragedy in Orlando wasn't even the only mass shooting; in Roswell, N.M., a
man was charged on Sunday with shooting his wife and their four children to death on Saturday. The oldest was
14; the youngest was 3.
In 2014, 33,599 Americans died from a gunshot wound. From 2001 to 2010, 119,246 Americans were murdered
with guns, 18 times all American combat deaths in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
That is a national crisis. And as a combat veteran and proud American, I believe we need a national response to
the gun violence that threatens so many of our communities.
Those of us who served in the military were trained in the effective and safe use of firearms. We were taught
about the responsibility that comes with carrying a gun. As combat infantrymen and special operators, we
received thousands of hours of firearms training.
In combat operations in places like Afghanistan, we often confronted the specter of dangerous people with
powerful weapons who were a threat to their community and to our soldiers. Our aim was to quickly determine
who in that community was a legitimate actor who could be trusted with a firearm and who was not.
Today, some of our politicians and the people who back them seem to promote a culture of gun ownership that
does not conform with what I learned in the military.
Here at home, many of us are alarmed by the carnage. We are alarmed by loopholes that let felons and domestic
abusers get hold of guns without a background check. We are alarmed that a known or suspected terrorist can go
to a federally licensed firearms dealer where background checks are conducted, pass that background check,
legally purchase a firearm and walk out the door.
Now veterans are speaking out. Last Friday, two days before the tragedy in Orlando, a new initiative, the
Veterans Coalition for Common Sense, led by the Navy combat veteran Capt. Mark Kelly and his wife, the former
Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was announced. Those of us serving on its advisory committee come from
every branch of our military and virtually every rank. We are trained in the use of firearms, and many of us have
served in combat. And we all think our country must do more to save lives from being cut short by gun violence.
As this national crisis continues to rage, I ask my fellow veterans -- patriots who have worn the uniform, who took
an oath to protect our Constitution and the Second Amendment, who served this great country -- to add your
voice to this growing call for change. America needs you.

In my life as a soldier and citizen, I have seen time and time again that inaction has dire consequences. In this
case, one consequence of our leaders' inaction is that felons, domestic abusers and suspected terrorists have
easy access to firearms.
Some opponents of closing these gaps in our laws will continue to argue that dangerous people will obtain guns
in our country no matter what, and therefore that taking steps to make it harder for them is fruitless. That is both
poor logic and poor leadership.
Just as something as complex as a combat operation in a war zone meant that we could not eliminate every
enemy combatant or prevent every American casualty, we cannot prevent every dangerous person from getting a
gun, and we cannot prevent every gun tragedy. But wouldn't preventing many of them be worth it? I believe it
would.
We Americans are not a uniquely bloodthirsty people. We do not have more violent video games or movies than
other countries. We do not have more dangerously mentally ill individuals than other countries. We are not unique
in facing down the threat of global terrorism and active shooters.
But we have uniquely high rates of gun deaths and injuries that make us stand out in the worst of ways. Our
communities should not feel like war zones. Our leaders can start by doing more to keep guns out of the hands of
those who cannot be trusted to handle them responsibly. That must be our mission.",10,DomesticPolicy,,,1,,,The author is addressing domestic gun control policy.

"Anderson, Gary",,1,2016-06-24,,1,0,WSJ,Marine Corps,,,M,How the Red Cross Killed Non-Lethal Weapons,"In 1995, led by Gen. Tony Zinni, senior Marines persuaded Congress to fund a Joint Non-Lethal Directorate. In the two decades since then, some non-lethal weapons have been deployed, including warning munitions, optical distractors and vehicle-stopping equipment. But other revolutionary non-lethal weapons have never been deployed","We had to destroy the village to save it."" That quote from an American officer during the Vietnam War was used to great effect by the antiwar movement of the 1960s. It comes to mind after the recent battle for Ramadi in which the Iraqi army and its associated militias, backed by American air power, virtually leveled the city to liberate it from Islamic State, or ISIS. Ramadi was held by fewer than 300 ISIS fighters, but retaking it involved a massive assault by thousands of Iraqi security forces.

Now a bloody battle to retake Fallujah from ISIS is under way, and the tens of thousands of men, women and children unlucky enough to be trapped are being used as human shields. Meanwhile, those lucky enough to escape are overwhelming aid agencies. There are better ways to conduct urban combat than to flatten entire city blocks, but they won't be employed in Iraq.

Those of us who fought in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993 believed that the difficulties faced there would signal the end of such blunt-force urban combat (the movie ""Black Hawk Down"" is a reasonable depiction of the challenges), and that more effective and technologically sophisticated methods had to be on the horizon.

After Somalia, the U.S. Marine Corps began experimenting to improve urban-combat capabilities. Maj. Gen. Mike Myatt had developed a compelling brief titled ""Chaos in the Littorals"" that persuaded the senior Marine Corps leadership that coastal megacities would be battlegrounds in the future. The Marine Corps' experimentation culminated in a series of exercises in 1998-2000 designated ""Urban Warrior.""

Part of that experimentation (in which I took part) included the development of more-discrete weapons that could take out a room being used as a sniper's roost rather than raze an entire building.

This experimentation paid off well after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq during the first battles for Fallujah and Ramadi. These were hard battles, but civilian and U.S. casualties were a fraction of those in past urban combat. Some of the new techniques included using small, unmanned vehicles to disarm improvised explosive devices, and dispatching unmanned aircraft (commonly known as drones) to see what was happening on the next block.

But the U.S. military's urban-fighting capabilities in Iraq could have been even better, with the lives of more troops and civilians saved, if not for political considerations that intervened.

During our experimentation in the 1990s, many of us in the U.S. military came to believe that the best alternative to destroying cities and their populations in order to ""save"" them was to develop non-lethal weapons capable of temporarily incapacitating everyone inside a building. Our troops could then enter the structure and separate the noncombatants from armed fighters.

In 1995, led by Gen. Tony Zinni, senior Marines persuaded Congress to fund a Joint Non-Lethal Directorate. In the two decades since then, some non-lethal weapons have been deployed, including warning munitions, optical distractors and vehicle-stopping equipment. But other revolutionary non-lethal weapons have never been deployed.

One such weapon is the Vehicle-Mounted Active Denial System, which uses directed energy -- a focused beam of millimeter waves -- to make targeted individuals feel that they are burning up, without actually doing harm. The effect ends when the target flees or the weapon is turned off. I know this because in 2005 I led the team that field tested VMADS. I've probably been zapped by it more than any other human. It is exactly the kind of non-lethal weapon that could have been deployed to great effect in the urban battlefields of Mogadishu in 1993 and Iraq today.

We had hoped to use the same technology to develop even better weapons that could clear buildings non-lethally by causing near-immediate temporary heat prostration to everyone inside. Unfortunately, even the existing VMADs weapons will probably never be used and more-capable weapons never developed. Why? Because of complaints by human-rights advocates, who seem to think that it's better to be dead than discomfited.

Ironically, human-rights organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross and Human Rights Watch that today decry the plight of civilians in Fallujah are the same groups that argued successfully against deploying advanced non-lethal weapons like VMADS. It is true, as the critics maintained, that in the wrong hands such weapons could be used to suppress peaceful demonstrations or even be set to kill. We in the military tried on a number of occasions to work with the human-rights community to develop law-of-war protocols that would allow for responsible use of such weapons and to develop controls that would prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.

Regrettably, the human-rights groups were intransigent, and most of us in the military concluded that we shouldn't spend scarce dollars on systems that would never be used.

Now, with Iraqi forces ill-trained for urban warfare and lacking non-lethal weapons that could have greatly aided their efforts, the retaking of Fallujah has resulted in another bloody urban battle and humanitarian crisis. Sadly, the coming battles for the far larger city of Mosul and the ISIS capital of Raqqa, could be even worse.

"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2016-08-10,,1,0,NYT,Air Force,,,M,Classified Briefings and Candidates,"The members of the Obama team took such dialogue seriously…I suspect Secretary Clinton would reach much the same.  How Mr. Trump -- who routinely describes those with alternative views as weak, corrupt, or stupid -- would respond is anyone's guess. But I'd rather not find out. ","The no-longer-presumptive nominees of the Democratic and Republican parties will soon start receiving periodic classified intelligence briefings, with the first one coming perhaps this week. Rarely has this routine ritual received so much public attention -- and with good reason.

To anyone who has actually had to protect the nation's secrets, Hillary Clinton's email setup as secretary of state was inconceivable and her later explanations of it were incomprehensible. The judgment by the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, that her handling of the emails was ""extremely careless"" was, to the intelligence tribe, a huge understatement.

Donald J. Trump has never been exposed to state secrets, so the issue is not that he may have been careless in the past. It's just that he seems to say anything that enters his head at the moment. That's a danger for someone who will now be living partly in a classified world.

But with Mr. Trump, the issue goes even deeper. Earlier this week I joined 49 other former national security officials who had served in Republican administrations in declaring that he lacked the ""character, values and experience"" to be president. Our letter noted that ""being willing to listen to his advisers"" is crucial to a good leader's temperament. That temperament will be tested in his first classified intelligence briefing.

Mr. Trump has asserted that the Islamic State is gaining strength, questioned the need for NATO, praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and extolled the benefits of Brexit. Yet I can picture that he'll soon receive a briefing that would include phrases like recent successes against the Islamic State, or threats to NATO unity, or Mr. Putin's ambitions in Ukraine, or the crippling consequences of Brexit.

Might a briefing change his mind? Probably not. After meetings with Henry A. Kissinger and James A. Baker III, prominent Republican secretaries of state, Mr. Trump said he came away with ""a lot of knowledge."" But asked if those meetings had altered his views, Mr. Trump simply replied, ""No."" Yet such openness to conflicting views is critical for a president who must constantly assess a complicated and ever-changing world.

Mrs. Clinton, whose candidacy I am not supporting, presents different challenges. Absent the email kerfuffle, the briefing for Mrs. Clinton could well begin with her saying, ""Now, where were we?"" But it was the director of national intelligence's inspector general, I. Charles McCullough III, who held his ground in saying that some of the emails on her server were indeed highly classified. Will hard feelings -- or lingering concerns about protecting data -- strain her relationship with the intelligence services?

The Republican and Democratic nominees will get identical intelligence briefings; no favoritism here. These briefings will not be very specific or frequent. But all that changes on election night. And that is when the president-elect's openness to information that runs counter to his or her worldview suddenly becomes especially important.

Wednesday morning after the election, a briefing team is going to give the president-elect the daily brief -- the real one, pretty much just like the one President Obama will get that day.

Do what it takes to get 270 electoral votes, and you get the real secrets -- worldview or carelessness or talkativeness be damned. It's a wonderful commentary on the sovereignty of the people. And the need to vote wisely.

The briefings themselves will be intense. The president-elect will be shown great deference personally, but his or her campaign positions could be treated more harshly. This is the chance for the intelligence professionals to set the record, as they see it, straight.

I had my own such experience. After Election Day in 2008, I was briefing Mr. Obama on C.I.A. renditions when Joseph R. Biden Jr., the vice president-elect, interrupted to observe that the agency had conducted that program -- which entailed sending suspected terrorists to third countries -- simply to ""rough them up."" I rejected the contention and advised him that he needed to stop saying that. I haven't heard him say it again.

In an intense briefing on Iran with President Obama shortly after his inauguration, he asked me how much low-enriched uranium the Iranians had at Natanz, a major nuclear plant where they had thousands of centrifuges spinning.

I thought he was asking the wrong question. I said that I knew the answer and would give it to him in a minute. But I added that there might be another way of looking at it, that there wasn't a neutron or electron at Natanz that was ever going to be in a nuclear weapon. What the Iranians were building at Natanz, I said, was technology and confidence, something not strictly related to the size of the stockpile. In other words, it was Natanz's operation, not its output, that was most important.

The members of Obama team took such dialogue seriously. They would go their own way, of course, but they didn't instinctively reject alternative views. I suspect Secretary Clinton would react much the same.

How Mr. Trump -- who routinely describes those with alternative views as weak, corrupt or stupid -- would respond is anyone's guess.

"Petraeus, David and O'Hanlon, Michael",2011,1,2016-08-11,,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,The Myth of a U.S. Military 'Readiness' Crisis,"While there are areas of concern, there is no crisis in military readiness. But that doesn't mean the U.S. is good enough -- especially in a world of rapidly changing technology, new threats emerging across several regions, and a constantly evolving strategic landscape. Here are some of the most pressing issues:","U.S. military readiness is again a hot issue in the presidential election, but unfortunately the current debate glosses over some of the most important facts. While Congress's sequestration-mandated cuts to military spending have hurt preparedness, America's fighting forces remain ready for battle. They have extensive combat experience across multiple theaters since 9/11, a tremendous high-tech defense industry supplying advanced weaponry, and support from an extraordinary intelligence community.

For those concerned that America's military is in decline or somehow not up to the next challenge, we offer a few reassuring facts:

-- The current national defense budget of over $600 billion a year far exceeds the Cold War average of about $525 billion (in inflation-adjusted 2016 dollars) and the $400 billion spent in 2001, according to official Pentagon and Office of Management and Budget data. The national defense budget, which doesn't include Veterans Affairs or the Department of Homeland Security, constitutes 35% of global military spending and is more than that of the next eight countries -- including China and Russia -- combined. Spending has been reduced from the levels of the late Bush and early Obama years, but that isn't unreasonable in light of scaled-down combat operations abroad and fiscal pressures at home.

-- Assuming no return to sequestration, as occurred in 2013, Pentagon budgets to buy equipment now exceed $100 billion a year, a healthy and sustainable level. The so-called ""procurement holiday"" of the 1990s and early 2000s is over.

-- While some categories of aircraft and other key weapons are aging and will need replacement or major refurbishment soon, most equipment remains in fairly good shape. According to our sources in the military, Army equipment has, on average, mission-capable rates today exceeding 90% -- a historically high level. Marine Corps aviation is an exception and urgently needs to be addressed.

-- Training for full-spectrum operations is resuming after over a decade of appropriate focus on counterinsurgency. By 2017 the Army plans to rotate nearly 20 brigades -- about a third of its force -- through national training centers each year. The Marine Corps plans to put 12 infantry battalions -- about half its force -- through large training exercises. The Air Force is funding its training and readiness programs at 80%-98% of what it considers fully resourced levels. This situation isn't perfect, but it has improved -- and while the military is still engaged in combat operations across the world.

-- The men and women of today's all-volunteer military continue to be outstanding and committed to protecting America. Typical scores of new recruits on the armed forces qualification test are now significantly better than in the Reagan years or the immediate pre-9/11 period, two useful benchmarks. The average time in service, a reflection of the experience of the force, is now about 80 months in the enlisted ranks, according to Defense Department data. That is not quite as good as in the 1990s, when the average was 85-90 months, but is better than the 75-month norm of the 1980s.

While there are areas of concern, there is no crisis in military readiness. But that doesn't mean the U.S. is good enough -- especially in a world of rapidly changing technology, new threats emerging across several regions, and a constantly evolving strategic landscape. Here are some of the most pressing issues:

Should the Army and Navy, considerably reduced in size in recent years, be modestly larger? Are the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps overemphasizing short-range tactical manned fighter jets in their aircraft modernization plans, and underemphasizing drones and bombers? Can the Navy develop underwater robotics and unmanned systems more aggressively? How can the U.S. more effectively counter other nations's ballistic- and cruise-missile capabilities? What more needs to be done to structure and enhance Defense Department capabilities for operations in cyberspace? How should the military best prepare and structure forces for ""advise and assist"" missions to the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere?

Beyond Defense Secretary Ash Carter's admirable initiatives, are there other ways the military can bring Silicon Valley and other innovators into the defense world? How much larger does the defense budget need to be, and how should it be structured, in base budget and supplemental funds for ongoing overseas operations? And what next steps might be needed to counter the growing assertiveness of Russia and China?

The good news is that there are reasonable answers to each of these challenges that are affordable and at least partially achievable. The bad news is that such issues are getting insufficient attention in the continuing debate. It's time to remedy that.

"Davis, Morris",,1,2016-08-12,,1,0,NYT,Air Force,,,M,Stop Meddling in the Bergdahl Case,"[What is happening with SGT Bowe Bergdahl] does not sit well with certain politicians who have treated Sergeant Bergdahl's case as if it were a political football. Foremost among them is Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ","Washington -- Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is to appear this month at the next hearing in his court-martial at Fort Bragg, N.C. After Sergeant Bergdahl walked off his Army outpost in Afghanistan in 2009, he was abducted and tortured by the Taliban, who subjected him to nearly five years of harsh captivity.

Sergeant Bergdahl faces charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, yet two senior military officers conducting separate, impartial investigations into his case have recommended no imprisonment. That outcome would be consistent with hundreds of other post-Sept. 11 desertion cases.

But that does not sit well with certain politicians who have treated Sergeant Bergdahl's case as if it were a political piñata. Foremost among them is Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

In March 2015, the Army warned the committee that holding any congressional hearing on Sergeant Bergdahl could undermine military justice. Two months later, after a senior McCain staff member raised the prospect of the senator's doing just that, an Army official repeated the warning against holding such a hearing. ""To do so,"" he added, ""would be unprecedented and deviate from defense oversight committees' longstanding practice of deference to allow ongoing military justice matters to proceed to completion without direct congressional involvement.""

Yet, in October, just after the second investigator made his recommendation of no imprisonment, Mr. McCain said, ""If it comes out that he has no punishment, we're going to have to have a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee.""

Mr. McCain also declared that Sergeant Bergdahl was ""clearly a deserter."" Such prejudgment of Sergeant Bergdahl's case is only slightly less alarming than the statements of the Republican presidential nominee (and potential commander in chief) Donald J. Trump. He has said repeatedly that Sergeant Bergdahl is ""a no-good traitor"" who would have been executed 30 years ago.

The day after the senator's statement, the Army asked that Mr. McCain make an announcement that would mitigate the appearance of improper influence on the military justice process. The Army even offered to assist in drafting it, but Mr. McCain stonewalled. Two months later, Gen. Robert B. Abrams, ignoring the advice of the investigative officers, sent the case to a court-martial, where Sergeant Bergdahl faces the possibility of life imprisonment -- a punishment that presumably Mr. McCain would view favorably.

I was a chief prosecutor for the military commissions that President George W. Bush created to try terrorism suspects for war crimes. Senator McCain was the lead architect of legislation that revived the commissions after a Supreme Court ruling struck them down in 2006.

I had a meeting with Mr. McCain on Sept. 7, 2006, the day after President Bush announced that he had transferred the Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and other high-value detainees to Guantánamo Bay to stand trial. The senator asked me, ""What do you need to get the job done right?""

I told him that a lot of people were trying to interfere with the course of military justice, and what I needed most was to ensure that the process was insulated from political meddling. Mr. McCain asked me to draft language to prevent outsider interference. Section 949b of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 is the provision that I wrote -- and which Senator McCain adopted verbatim: ""No person may attempt to coerce or, by any unauthorized means, influence the action of a military commission.""

The Bergdahl defense team has obtained emails between the Pentagon and congressional staff members showing Mr. McCain's continual prodding of the Army about the case. That kind of involvement is inappropriate from any member of Congress, but it is especially egregious for the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, since his committee has power over appointments to top Pentagon posts as well as military officer promotions.

As a result of Mr. McCain's repeated attempts to put his thumb on the scales of justice, Sergeant Bergdahl's lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him or to limit his sentence to no punishment.

The Army deserves credit for recognizing the corrosive power of improper influence, and it must now send a clear message that partisan politics holds no sway over military justice. The Army should also approve the request by Sergeant Bergdahl's lawyer.

The integrity of the military justice system must outweigh the pandering of politicians. Senator McCain should give Sergeant Bergdahl the same protection from meddling he afforded Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.",6,CivMilBalance,,1,,,,Blasting SEN John McCain.,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Petraeus, David",2011,1,2016-08-13,,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,"For Mosul, Learning From 2003",There is no question that the Islamic State will be defeated in Mosul; the real question is what comes afterward. Can the post-Islamic State effort resolve the squabbling likely to arise over numerous issues and bring lasting stability to one of Iraq's most diverse and challenging provinces? Failure to do so could lead to ISIS 3.0.,"In the next few months, a mixed force of Iraqi Arab and Kurdish security forces - including various Sunni and perhaps some Shiite militia elements - will enter Mosul, clear the city of Islamic State extremists and then work to bring governance, stability and reconstruction to one of Iraq's most complex cities and its province.

There is no question that the Islamic State will be defeated in Mosul; the real question is what comes afterward. Can the post-Islamic State effort resolve the squabbling likely to arise over numerous issues and bring lasting stability to one of Iraq's most diverse and challenging provinces? Failure to do so could lead to ISIS 3.0.

The prospect of the operation to clear Mosul brings to mind experiences from the spring of 2003, when the 101st Airborne Division, which I was privileged to command, entered a Mosul in considerable turmoil. Our first task, once a degree of order had been restored, was to determine how to establish governance. That entailed getting Iraqi partners to help run the city of nearly 2 million people and the rest of Nineveh Province - a very large area about which we knew very little.

Establishing a representative interim council to work with us in Nineveh proved to be no easy task - and its formation and subsequent developments hold insights for the coming endeavor in Mosul.

The challenge of Mosul and Nineveh is the considerable number of ethnic groups, religious sects, tribes and other elements that make up the province. Ultimately, we ensured that the provincial council included representatives of every district in Nineveh, of every major religion (Sunni, Shiite, Christian, Shabak), of each ethnic group (Arabs, Kurds, Yazidis, Turkmen), of every additional major societal element (Mosul University academics, businessmen, retired generals) and of each major tribe not already sufficiently represented.

We were able to structure a caucus that elected an interim provincial council. That council, in turn, elected an experienced, able interim governor (a Sunni Arab, given that Sunni Arabs made up the majority of Nineveh's population), who was a well-respected, highly decorated former major general whose brother had been killed by Saddam Hussein and who had himself been under house arrest for a considerable period.

Importantly, I had the legal authority needed and the forces necessary to back up that authority, if required. I was not reluctant to exercise either.

U.S. forces today obviously lack the authority, remit and sheer numbers of the U.S. elements in Iraq in 2003. They also do not have the mandate that we had in the early days. But the enabling forces that the U.S.-led coalition has provided for Iraqi elements over the past year - intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets, advisers, logistical elements, and precision strike platforms, in particular - have been instrumental in the successes enjoyed by the Iraqis in Ramadi, Fallujah, Tikrit, Baiji, Qayyarah and a host of other battle sites.

I have no doubt that coalition assets will, in the weeks ahead, do so much damage to the surviving Islamic State elements in Mosul that the battle there may well be less intense than many have feared. Thus, the most significant challenge in Mosul will not be to defeat the Islamic State; rather, it will be the task we faced there in 2003: to ensure post-conflict security, reconstruction and, above all, governance that is representative of and responsive to the people. All of this will have to be pursued largely by Iraqis, of different allegiances, without the kinds of forces, resources and authorities that we had.

Leaders of the various Iraqi elements will likely have their own militias, and there will be endless rounds of brinkmanship on the road to post-Islamic State boundaries, governing structures and distribution of power and resources. If those challenges are not enough, others will emanate from Iran and the Shiite militias it supports, from Turkey and Iraq's Sunni Arab neighbors, from the Kurdish Regional Government that understandably wants to retain the disputed internal boundary areas that its peshmerga now largely control, and so on.

The effort in Mosul and Nineveh in the spring, summer and early fall of 2003 was very successful. Ultimately, however, it was undone by an inability to get Iraqi authorities in Baghdad to approve initiatives we pursued in reconciliation with former Baath Party members cast out of work by the Coalition Provisional Authority's de-Baathification decree and in providing work for the tens of thousands of Iraq soldiers also rendered unemployed by the authority. The other ultimate challenge was the lack of clear direction and resources from Baghdad for their ministries' activities in Nineveh. These failures meant that the Sunni insurgency ultimately intensified in Mosul, as it already had in the other Sunni Arab areas of Iraq. The Sunni Arabs in Nineveh came to see few reasons to support the new Iraq; indeed, they perceived many to actively or tacitly oppose it.

There clearly are lessons to be learned from our earlier experience - and from after the departure of U.S. forces in late 2011. Most particularly, they have to do with the need for inclusive, representative and responsive governance.

In the case of Mosul, Nineveh's Sunni Arabs, in particular, will need considerable reassurances that their interests will be adequately represented in the new Mosul and Nineveh. But so will the Kurdish citizens of Nineveh (of multiple political parties), as well as Shiite Arabs, Shiite and Sunni Turkmen, Yazidis, Christians, Shabak and numerous tribes.

The best vehicle for carrying this out would be a provincial council like the one set up in 2003, and through a similarly inclusive process. Importantly, Shiite militias should play no role in post-Islamic State security and governance. Because Nineveh and the other Sunni Arab provinces lack significant energy resources and the leverage they provide, Kurdish-style constitutional autonomy is not a viable option. Nonetheless, Baghdad and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi will need to be prepared to make more explicit commitments about levels of resourcing, and also perhaps grant the region greater autonomy in determining spending priorities. The task facing Abadi is exceedingly complex, but the only way forward is to squarely face the challenges, work to build relationships and press the many disparate parties to find common ground on the issues - aided by the U.S.-led coalition.

The process to resolve post-Islamic State issues will be difficult and intense. But having enabled the defeat of the Islamic State and having provided the largest amount of assets to ensure further successes and reconstruction initiatives, the United States, together with its numerous coalition partners, will have considerable influence over the resolution of the issues. It will have to exercise that influence.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Cartwright, James and Blair, Bruce",2011,1,2016-08-16,,1,0,NYT,Marine Corps,,,M,End the First Use Policy for Nuclear Weapons,"Using nuclear weapons first against Russia and China would endanger our and our allies' very survival by encouraging full-scale retaliation. Any first use against lesser threats, such as countries or terrorist groups with chemical and biological weapons, would be gratuitous; there are alternative means of countering those threats.","Throughout the nuclear age, presidents have allowed their senior commanders to plan for the first use of nuclear weapons. Contingency plans were drawn to initiate first strikes to repel an invasion of Europe by the Soviet Union, defeat China and North Korea, take out chemical and biological weapons and conduct other missions.

After the end of the Cold War, which coincided with revolutionary advances in our nonnuclear military capacities, the range of these missions steadily narrowed to the point where nuclear weapons today no longer serve any purpose beyond deterring the first use of such weapons by our adversaries. Our nonnuclear strength, including economic and diplomatic power, our alliances, our conventional and cyber weaponry and our technological advantages, constitute a global military juggernaut unmatched in history. The United States simply does not need nuclear weapons to defend its own and its allies' vital interests, as long as our adversaries refrain from their use.

Using nuclear weapons first against Russia and China would endanger our and our allies' very survival by encouraging full-scale retaliation. Any first use against lesser threats, such as countries or terrorist groups with chemical and biological weapons, would be gratuitous; there are alternative means of countering those threats. Such use against North Korea would be likely to result in the blanketing of Japan and possibly South Korea with deadly radioactive fallout.

But beyond reducing those dangers, ruling out first use would also bring myriad benefits. To start, it would reduce the risk of a first strike against us during global crises. Leaders of other countries would be calmed by the knowledge that the United States viewed its own weapons as deterrents to nuclear warfare, not as tools of aggression.

The policy would also reduce costs by gutting the rationale for retaining the large arsenal of land-based strategic missiles in silos across the Midwest and the tactical nuclear weapons deployed in Europe. Those missiles are mainly for first-use; they are a risky option for second-use because they are highly vulnerable to enemy attack. Eliminating these weapons entirely would be the best option.

Phasing out land-based missiles and shifting to a reliance on submarines and bombers would save about $100 billion over the next three decades. The elimination of smaller, tactical nuclear weapons would save billions more. President Obama could begin the phaseout of land-based missiles before he left office by instructing the Department of Defense to remove 550 weapons from the operationally deployed category and transfer them to long-term storage, thereby reducing the operationally deployed inventory to about 1,000 strategic warheads. These missiles are surplus weapons no longer needed for deterrence.

A no-first-use policy would also reduce the risks of accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons. By scrapping the vulnerable land-based missile force, any need for launching on warning disappears. Strategic bombers can be sent aloft on warning of an apparent incoming attack, which may or may not be a false alarm, and stay up until the situation clarifies. Strategic submarines are extremely survivable and exert no pressure on decision-makers to fire them quickly. They can patrol for months waiting for instructions. Both bombers and submarines are also less vulnerable to cyberwarfare than the strategic missiles on land.

Finally, no-first-use would help ensure that democratically elected officials maintained control over nuclear weapons. Savings from reducing the nuclear force could be invested in fortifying command centers and communications networks, which would better protect the president and ensure the continuity of government during a crisis. This would not only fortify deterrence but also reduce the current possibility of a president's losing control over nuclear operations at an early stage of conflict.

Beyond those benefits, we believe a no-first-use policy could catalyze multilateral negotiations to reduce nuclear arms, discourage nonnuclear states from developing them and reinforce the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

Although a no-first-use policy would limit the president's discretion by imposing procedural and physical constraints on his or her ability to initiate the use of nuclear weapons, we believe such checks on the commander in chief would serve the national interest.

President Obama has an opportunity to further delegitimize nuclear weapons by adopting no-first-use as a core principle of United States security policy on the grounds that first-use is unnecessary and a threat to national survival and humanity itself. We could still maintain a robust nuclear umbrella to protect ourselves and our allies.

China and India adopted this policy long ago, and the American people overwhelmingly support it, according to a recent survey . In that poll, two-thirds say the United States should use nuclear weapons only in response to a nuclear attack or not at all, while just 18 percent think that first-use may be justified sometimes.

President Obama would be wise to follow China's example. As commander in chief, he can adopt no-first-use overnight and lead the way in establishing it as a global norm among all of the nine countries with nuclear weapons. The next president ought to stay that course. Our nation, our allies and indeed the world will be better and safer for it.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444

After the invasion of Grenada on Oct. 25, 1983, by U.S. military forces and the problems in handling media coverage, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John W. Vessey Jr. created a panel of 14 experts from the military and the media to examine the Grenada operation and recommend how to best accommodate the legitimate needs of the news media in reporting on military operations in the future. Vessey directed the panel, headed by retired Maj. Gen. Winant Sidle, to answer the question ""How do we conduct military operations in a manner that safeguards the lives of our military and protects the security of the operation, while keeping the American public informed through the media?"" The Sidle Panel's answer laid the foundation for how the media reports military operations today. The panel, comprising various media representatives and public affairs officers from the Pentagon, as well as operations representatives from the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and each branch of the armed forces, met in February 1984 for a week-long conference at Fort McNair and laid out eight recommendations and a statement of principle to govern military-media relations. In its final comments, the Sidle Panel noted, ""An adversarial - perhaps politely critical would be a better term - relationship between the media and the government, including the military, is healthy and helps guarantee that both institutions do a good job. However, this relationship must not become antagonistic - an 'us versus them' relationship. The appropriate media role in relation to the government has been summarized aptly as being neither that of lap dog nor an attack dog but, rather, a watchdog. Mutual antagonism and distrust are not in the best interests of the media, the military, or the American people.""

"Keane, Jack and Apgar IV, Mahlon",2003,1,2016-08-31,,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,The Army Offers a Model for Broader Defense Reform,"Whichever presidential candidate succeeds in November, these defense reforms should be high on the new administration's list.","This is the year of defense reform. Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and
Defense Secretary Ash Carter have launched initiatives to streamline structures and systems that have governed
the U.S. military for more than three decades. We suggest they take a look back to a program we helped launch
in the 1990s to upgrade Army housing.
The program's success shows how partnerships between business and the military can often achieve better
outcomes than the military can achieve on its own. This is especially so when applied to the vast infrastructure
that consumes more than $200 billion of today's defense budget.
The Army faced a triple threat in the 1990s: declining recruiting and retention rates, poor housing and a $6 billion
housing-maintenance deficit. Twenty years later, military housing has been turned around. The maintenance
backlog has been cleared, quality housing is being produced, and safe, supportive family communities are again
a reason to re-enlist.
As we look back, the main culprit was a complicated procurement and budgetary regime that deterred
best-in-class developers from engaging with the military to solve its housing problem. The system was wired to
favor those with skills in contracting over those with skills in home building.
In 1996, in response to recommendations by then-Secretary of Defense William Perry, Congress authorized the
Military Housing Privatization Initiative, which aimed to attract private-sector expertise to help solve the housing
crisis. At the Army, our implementation strategy had five core elements:
First, we put together packages of 3,000 to 6,000 housing units. The aim was to attract large, sophisticated
developers with community-scale vision, capital and capabilities. Second, we structured 50-year land leases to
encourage creative planning and project execution while preserving Army ownership and control to meet future
needs. Third, we simplified management and held managers accountable for achieving our desired outcomes.
Fourth, we required joint working teams and gave them frequent milestones. And finally, we replaced the
traditional government ""request for proposal"" with a ""request for qualifications"" through which private partners
were selected for their creative vision, financial capacity and management acumen as well as for their technical
skills.
To execute this strategy, we took our show on the road, reaching out to industry leaders with presentations that
detailed the new market opportunities at an institution they respected but didn't see as a business partner. The
results speak for themselves. Developers have raised more than $10 billion of private capital to leverage some $2
billion of public investment, producing $1.6 billion in annual portfolio income. That's a 6-to-1 ""budget multiplier"" of
private to public dollars.
This investment has produced 86,000 new and renovated units on 44 installations to a higher quality standard
than government-built housing achieves for comparable public expenditures. Maintenance response time has
been cut in half, energy-saving innovations have been implemented, customer-satisfaction rates exceed 80%,
and limited resources have been freed up for more pressing military needs. Today, 98% of the Army's U.S.
housing inventory is in the care of 10 high-quality, efficient private developer-managers.
Our experience suggests five principles of defense reform that could help the next administration create and
guide other successful initiatives.

-- Fuse public and private interests. Partnerships are driven by public purposes but fueled by private means and
methods. This blend of government and business is nonideological and nonpartisan, conservative in its fisc yet
liberal in its humanity.
-- Plan from the inside out. Military-business partnerships start with the soldier and his or her family, not the
budget or the building. These priorities redirect attention from defending organizational turf to focusing on
common goals and problem solving.
-- Act strategically yet opportunistically. The defining attribute of the military-business partners is their willingness
to trade short-term gains for long-term benefits. Joint visions are carefully crafted and rigorously negotiated for
each project, with independent oversight that protects the public interest but reduces administrative interference.
-- Cross institutional, functional and geographic boundaries. The military is unified by a common purpose (despite
interservice rivalries). Yet its vertical silos and risk-averse cultures can impede performance. Partnerships cross
the Defense Department's many domains by teaming business people with military members; distributing
performance data up, across and down the organizations; eliminating nonproductive overheads and installing
outcome-based systems.
-- Focus more on best-value outcomes than least-cost activities. Value, like beauty, is often in the eye of the
beholder. Communities aren't commodities; partnerships have shown that the Pentagon's conventional
contracting methods can be more costly in the long run while risking mediocre results.
The success in military-housing partnerships suggests that other assets in the Pentagon's trillion-dollar portfolio --
offices, warehousing, maintenance -- could be monetized and their performance improved. If the Defense
Department were authorized to follow the best practices of American business and shed 10% to 20% of its
infrastructure-related costs, it could save $20 billion to $40 billion a year. Whichever presidential candidate
succeeds in November, these defense reforms should be high on the new administration's list.",10,CivMilBalance,,,,,,,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Mullen, Mike and Nunn, Sam",2011,1,2016-09-16,,1,0,WaPO,Navy,,,M,A Sharper Focus on North Korea,"North Korea presents one of the most dangerous international security challenges facing the world. In April, Chinese President Xi Jinping told a group of foreign diplomats that his country ""will never allow war or chaos on the peninsula,"" a statement that seemed to apply to all parties. The United States and China have a shared and vital national interest in preventing this from occurring. The time to act on that interest is now.","North Korea's accelerating nuclear and missile programs, including its recent nuclear test, pose a grave and expanding threat to security, stability and peace in Asia and the rest of the world. This threat affects close U.S. allies - South Korea and Japan - and U.S. personnel and facilities in the region. In the coming months and years, it will create increasing danger for the United States. It is likely that the next president will face a North Korea that has gained the capability to strike the United States with nuclear weapons.

The Obama administration has succeeded in strengthening U.S. alliances in Asia and deterring a war, but, like its predecessors, has failed to change Pyongyang's assessment that defiance is preferable to conciliation. It is clear that the next president will have to sharpen Pyongyang's choice: offer greater benefits for cooperation and promise greater costs for continued defiance.

For the past several months, we have led a task force to assess the state of U.S. policy toward North Korea and to propose a new comprehensive strategy for the region.

Our goal - and most of the world's goal - is a stable and nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, at peace in the region and with the world. To achieve that, the world's leading nations must come together as never before to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, prevent it from spreading nuclear and missile technology to dangerous actors, and address its unconscionable human rights record. We do not seek to promote conflict - we seek to promote peace.

We make four principal recommendations, to be implemented in parallel:

1. Addressing the North Korean threat must be a ""front-burner issue"" for the United States and China. China can help get North Korea back to the negotiating table by working with the United States, South Korea, Japan and Russia on both diplomatic and economic approaches that will help restart negotiations with North Korea. To encourage China to participate, the United States should offer a new dialogue on the future of the peninsula that includes discussion of the disposition of U.S. forces. This dialogue should coordinate planning in the event of a crisis and convey that it is not U.S. policy to cause the collapse of the North Korean regime.

2. New and genuine incentives should be offered for North Korea to participate in substantive talks. These talks would include the possibility of a comprehensive deal in which North Korea, South Korea and the United States - supported by China - signed a peace agreement that would finally end the Korean War and gradually normalize relations in exchange for complete nuclear disarmament and progress on human rights. A new diplomatic approach could potentially freeze North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and lay the groundwork for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.

3. Further steps must be taken to increase economic sanctions that more severely restrict the regime's funding sources. The Obama administration laid a foundation for this with the strong sanctions recently achieved by the U.N. Security Council with the support of China and Russia. We recommend creating a standing multilateral mechanism to coordinate the implementation of Security Council resolutions. This should be facilitated by the sharing of intelligence, coordinating enforcement operations and distribution of resources donated by partners outside the region. Strictly enforcing the new Security Council sanctions, including the mandate to inspect all North Korean cargo and apply serious economic pressure, can help curb criminal activity from the regime, and, most important, prevent the spread of nuclear and missile materials and technology. Current enforcement of sanctions is far too lax.

4. The United States should secure its interests and those of its allies against the North Korean nuclear and missile threats by expanding U.S.-SouthKorea-Japan cooperation and strengthening its joint deterrence profile. The Pentagon should step up its work with U.S. allies to build the capacity necessary to enhance deterrence on the peninsula, enforce sanctions and impede North Korean missile programs. Expanded naval capacity will be needed to interdict North Korean vessels, detect submarine activity and intercept North Korean missile launches.

If Pyongyang refuses to negotiate, the United States and its allies should judiciously apply new military measures to deny North Korea the benefit of its actions and to strengthen deterrence against military attacks. This can include the United States, South Korea and Japan jointly signaling that future North Korean aggression would be met with an active and proportionate self-defense response, including inside North Korea.

We also recommend that the United States and its allies jointly build the capacity to intercept all missiles originating from North Korea with a range-payload capability greater than existing Scud missiles (approximately 1,000 kilometers) - whether they are declared to be ballistic missile tests or civil space launch vehicles.

These responses to North Korea's continued defiance of U.N. resolutions will not be easy and are not without risk. We do not support a policy of inducing a collapse of the North Korean regime, and these steps will have to be carefully implemented.

North Korea continues to commit unconscionable crimes against its citizens. We recommend working through the United Nations to increase pressure on North Korea to abide by internationally recognized standards for human rights, including by suspending North Korea's credentials.

North Korea presents one of the most dangerous international security challenges facing the world. In April, Chinese President Xi Jinping told a group of foreign diplomats that his country ""will never allow war or chaos on the peninsula,"" a statement that seemed to apply to all parties.

"Dempsey, Martin",2015,1,2016-09-18,,1,0,USA Today,Army,,,M,Why We Stand for the Flag,"We do so [stand for the flag] not because we agree with everything America has done, or everything that has been done in America's name, but because despite all of that the world is a better place because America exists. That seems to me to be worth the honor of respect during the national anthem. ","In the course of everyday life, there are very few opportunities for the people of the United States to come together, pause and reflect on the hope that is only possible with freedom and democracy. Our national anthem is a statement of respect for this hope, not a declaration that those present agree with everything our nation does or fails to do.

That’s why members of the military and other public servants love sports and why sports love them. As the 18th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I witnessed the public ritual of playing the national anthem at sporting events dozens of times and saw Americans rise above their own self interests and celebrate something that is greater than themselves. More recently, I was in Rio de Janeiro for the Olympics and stood with enormous pride as our flag was raised and the anthem played when outstanding athletes across a variety of sports were moved to tears by the honor of representing their country.  Life presents plenty of opportunities for us to disagree with one another and seemingly fewer opportunities on which we agree. Standing together during the national anthem at sporting events should be one of those times when we agree, when we focus on the things that bind us together, even as we prepare to let our voices be heard in disagreement about which team is the better team.
It’s important to remember that our military is composed entirely of volunteers. It obviously takes a special kind of patriotism for people to volunteer to risk their life for their country. Theirs is not blind patriotism that pretends there is nothing wrong with the country. Every man and woman in uniform knows we still have work to do to achieve the equality, opportunity and justice for all to which we aspire. But every member of the military also knows that what is right about America is worth defending. And if it’s worth defending, it’s worth honoring.  I spent my professional life defending individual rights, and I did so with the knowledge that sometimes people would use those rights in ways that might be hurtful or insensitive. I just hope that the athletes who are using the anthem as a protest understand why people like me intend to keep standing during the national anthem. We do so not because we agree with everything America has done, or everything that has been done in America's name, but because despite all of that the world is a better place because America exists. That seems to me to be worth the honor of respect during the national anthem.  What’s wrong about America can't be fixed unless we acknowledge, protect and, yes, honor what is right about America. For for those who don’t like standing because they disagree with what America has done, stand and pay it forward for what you think America should do. Then, as the last echoes of the anthem fade away, go back to arguing for change from that foundation of promise that is the national anthem.",10,Support,,,,,,,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2016-11-04,,1,0,WaPO,Air Force,,1,M,Russia's Useful Fool,"I'd prefer another term [for Presidential Candidate Trump]…polezni durak That's the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but whose blind support is happily accepted and exploited. ","I know I'm not the first to notice this, but Donald Trump really does sound a lot like Vladimir Putin.

There has always been a sympathetic authoritarian chord between the Republican presidential nominee and the Russian president. Both are on record as admiring The Strong Leader. They've even complimented one another on the trait. Putin could have been humming along when Trump was claiming ""I alone can fix it"" during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. Maybe he was.

Each seems to have a pretty conspiratorial view of the world, too. Putin comes by his naturally. He's a product of a KGB Marxist philosophy where ""the other"" -- any other -- is reflexively identified as hostile and created by immutable forces of history, something to be feared and ultimately crushed.

Trump seems to view business a bit that way. At least I don't recall a lot of win-win vocabulary when he touts his dealmaking skills.

At the political level, Trump sees quite a few powerful ""others"" in the American electoral process: a corrupt media, international banks, unrestricted immigrants, a variety of globalists, free-traders and (at least some) Muslims. It's a list Putin could second or, in some cases, jail or worse.

Sounding simultaneously populist and a little bit the conspiratorial Marxist, Trump has claimed that these unseen forces could rig the U.S. election. It's a theme that Putin is happy to echo. Indeed, it's a theme that his intelligence services are happy to actively propagate.

And in that case, the American presidential candidate routinely comes to the defense of his Russian soul mate. In the face of a high-confidence judgment of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and then weaponized embarrassing emails to sow confusion here, the man who would be president has declared: ""Our country has no idea,"" ""I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. . . . It could also be lots of other people"" and ""They always blame Russia.""

Rejecting a fact-based intelligence assessment -- not because of compelling contrarian data, but because it is inconsistent with a preexisting worldview -- that's the stuff of ideological authoritarianism, not pragmatic democracy. And it is frightening.

Trump also echoes Putin when it comes to Syria and the Islamic State, or ISIS. Here he follows the Moscow line that we and the Russians have common purpose and that Russia and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad (and Iran) are ""killing ISIS.""

Actually, they are not. They are bucking up the Assad regime that, if anyone is keeping score, has killed more innocents than the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate, have combined. And the attractiveness of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda to Sunni Muslims is a direct byproduct of the depredations of the Assad regime -- the regime that Russia saved from collapse a year ago.

It's a little complicated, I suppose, but not so hard that it explains or justifies the willful ignorance that Trump seems to display. His second debate formulation -- ""I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS"" -- is precisely the formulation that the Syrian president has been attempting to craft. ""It's me or the terrorists"" has been his false dilemma. It's hard to explain how the candidate of a major American political party could have gotten there, especially after receiving classified intelligence briefings.

Perhaps some of this is explained by the murky ties of some on team Trump to things Russian. There is certainly a history there, and perhaps a comfort level as well.

Former campaign manager Paul Manafort did consulting work for the now-discredited but decidedly pro-Russian regime of Viktor Yanokovych in Ukraine, and recent revelations in Kiev have stoked questions about whether Manafort should have registered here as working on behalf of a foreign power.

Manafort denies any role in July's successful effort to suppress a Republican platform pledge to provide lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainians in their continuing battle against separatists and the Russian army. Although it's clear that the suppression was initiated by Trump staffers, Trump has denied any personal responsibility for it. The whole episode was too quickly forgotten; it begs explanation.

Then there's Carter Page, an adviser with intermittent contacts with the campaign, but with deep ties to Russian money, oil and gas, who has blamed aggressive Western policies for the mess in the Ukraine and what he describes as the ""so-called annexation of Crimea."" So-called?

And what about the money? Although Trump has said, ""I have zero investments in Russia,"" his son Donald Jr. conceded in 2008 that ""Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets . . . we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."" Absent more detailed data (such as tax returns), who knows?

We have really never seen anything like this. Former acting CIA director Michael Morell says that Putin has cleverly recruited Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.

I'd prefer another term drawn from the arcana of the Soviet era: polezni durak. That's the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but whose blind support is happily accepted and exploited.

That's a pretty harsh term, and Trump supporters will no doubt be offended. But, frankly, it's the most benign interpretation of all this that I can come up with right now.",10,DomesticPolicy,,1,,,,The author is blasting/explicitly criticzing Trump.,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,37.4826371,47.2072444
"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2016-11-15,,1,0,WaPO,Air Force,,1,M,Trump's Most Important New Partner,"With that record, a fair question is: What role will facts and fact-bearers play in the Trump administration? What happens when he is told that Syrian refugees are already extremely vetted? Or when his intel briefer dishes up that the Russians really aren't targeting the Islamic State? What controls -- new data or preexisting mythology? For many authoritarian populists (think the leaders of Turkey, Venezuela and Russia), it's the latter.","I don't envy the president-elect's intelligence briefers. Candidate Donald Trump stormed through the election as a primal force of dystopia, anger and accusation. More often than not, there was little effort to back up accusations with fact. Many of them were, in fact, not true.

Hence, we were told we could ""take out"" terrorists' families because the 9/11 hijackers' families were aware of the attack and fled North America just before the hijackings. And that the president of the United States actually ""founded ISIS""; he didn't make errors in policy and set the conditions for the Islamic State terrorist group to emerge, he founded it. And Mexicans (rapists, mostly) are still streaming across our southern border. Most Muslims ""hate us."" (Check out that 9/11 celebratory video from New Jersey.)

Then the candidate disregarded intelligence that Russia was hacking the emails of the Democratic National Committee, claiming, ""I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC"" and ""Our country has no idea.""

With that record, a fair question is: What role will facts and fact-bearers play in the Trump administration? What happens when he is told that Syrian refugees are already extremely vetted? Or when his intel briefer dishes up that the Russians really aren't targeting the Islamic State?

What controls -- new data or preexisting mythology? For many authoritarian populists (think the leaders of Turkey, Venezuela and Russia), it's the latter.

The intelligence community sometimes makes mistakes, but it strives to create a fact-based, inductive view of the world. From as much data as it can acquire, it works to create general conclusions. Not surprisingly, there are often tensions with policymakers who tend to be deductive, trying to apply their vision to specific situations.

And there are special issues when data-based conclusions collide with vision-based expectations. We had long and serious discussions in 2007 when a draft estimate assessed that Iran had stopped work on an aspect of its nuclear weapons program. I suspect a similar dynamic unfolded in the Obama administration when evidence pointed to the rebirth of al-Qaeda in Iraq in the face of claims that the organization was ""on the run."" The unpleasant fact is always contentious.

I've had my debates with presidents and vice presidents over intelligence estimates. I've argued over facts and analysis. But all this was done under the broad mantle of empiricism, the belief that truth emanated from evidence and experience, not from a priori reasoning, intuition or faith -- even faith in self.

The president-elect has powerful instincts that seem to have served him well during the campaign. But instinct only goes so far. The president-elect does not know more about the Islamic State than the generals.

So now, as the weight of the office should become apparent, how much will the president-elect accept that he needs intensive briefings and readings to supplement a thin personal database on global affairs?

What kind of attention span will he have for issues that are complex, nuanced, historical and seemingly endless: ""So that's it for the Islamic State, Mr. President-elect. What next? Jabhat al-Nusra? Boko Haram? AQAP? Or should we cover Sunnism vs. Shiism?""

How much humility will be on offer -- as in the president-elect admitting a lack of knowledge in order to better learn? How much will he listen to absorb, rather than to rebut? The comment this summer about reading the briefers' body language to divine their opposition to administration policy was not encouraging.

Most important, which of the president-elect's existing instincts and judgments are open to revision as more data is revealed?

One important sign will be who attends briefings with him. In August, candidate and staff questioned the integrity and competence of the intelligence community even before their first session.

Better now if the candidate enlists folks to help him leverage the output of a 100,000-person, $53 billion annual enterprise largely designed to serve him and make him wiser.

For its part, the intelligence community needs to understand how the president-elect learns and how contrarian ideas are best served up to him. Not an easy task.

And the intelligence community needs to stand its ground, even, or especially, when it is irritating the client in chief. Simply writing down an unwelcome assessment or saying it once is not enough.

Many factors legitimately influence decision-making, including a president's intuition. Intelligence is rarely the sole determinant of an action. Yet good intelligence should create the basis, and set the outside boundaries, for rational choices.

That's the tough task before the president-elect's intelligence briefers, and they owe its accomplishment to their professional ethic, to the nation -- and to the new president.",10,Warfighting,,1,,,,The author explicitly criticizes Trump.,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2016-12-13,,1,0,WaPO,Air Force,,1,M,A Damaging Disregard for Intel,"As I wrote last month, intelligence should be called on to create the basis, and set the boundaries, for rational policy choices. That's still true. The odds that it will happen, though, seem a little bleaker after this past week. And we are moving in the wrong direction [re: the incoming Trump Presidency].","A month ago I wrote here about the importance and challenge of the intelligence community establishing a relationship with President-elect Donald Trump.

That has just gotten more important and more challenging.

In my November op-ed, I asked: ""What role will facts and fact-bearers play in the Trump administration? ... Which of the president-elect's existing instincts and judgments are open to revision as more data is revealed?""

I had in mind the president-elect's confidence in his own a priori beliefs and specifically his rejection of the intelligence community's judgment that Russia had stolen American emails and weaponized their content to corrode faith in our electoral processes.

The president-elect has been unmoved in his rejection of this high- confidence judgment. In Time magazine's article last week naming him ""Person of the Year,"" Trump repeated, ""I don't believe it. I don't believe they interfered.""

Shortly afterward, The Post reported that CIA analysts now believe the Russian aim was to help Trump win.

Team Trump immediately went into attack mode, employing the bureaucratic equivalent of the ad hominems the president-elect used during the campaign (""Crooked Hillary,"" ""Lyin' Ted,"" ""Little Marco""). ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,"" its first salvo described the U.S. intelligence community.

Then Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer alleged on CNN that ""there are people within these agencies who are upset with the outcome of the election.""

Incompetent. Politicized. No need to discuss any further. Move on.

To be fair, the ""Russia did it"" announcement in October was official and well documented. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. attached their reputations to it. This new ""Russians did it to help Trump"" story was murky, unofficial and tied to anonymous sources.

An administration-in-waiting more confident in itself, in its own legitimacy, in U.S. institutions and in the people it will soon govern might have said, ""These are serious issues. We intend to hear them out. Nothing is more precious than our democratic process. We have asked the Obama administration for details.""

The fact that that didn't happen should invite tons of commentary. But not from me. My narrow concerns as an intelligence officer are the questions raised above. How will this affect the new president's relationship with the intelligence community?

A lot. And not well.

First is the question of how the incoming administration values intelligence. On Sunday, the president-elect again rejected the Russian role, adding that he was smart enough that he didn't want or need a daily briefing.

This creates more than hurt feelings. The intelligence community makes great sacrifices, and CIA directors send people into harm's way to learn things otherwise unavailable. And directors have seen stars carved on the agency's memorial wall because of it. If what is gained is not used or wanted or is labeled as suspect or corrupt - by what moral authority does a director put his people at risk?

Then there is the ethic of the intelligence profession, captured by the gospel of John's dictum in the agency's headquarters lobby - that the truth will set you free.

What happens if the incoming administration directs that the ""Russia did it"" file be closed? Would standing intelligence requirements to learn more about this be eliminated? And if they were, what would the agency do with relevant data that would inevitably come through its collection network?

And what about the statute that requires the CIA and the rest of the intelligence community to keep Congress ""fully and currently informed"" about all significant intelligence activities? Data on a foreign power manipulating the federal electoral process would certainly qualify. What will the White House position be when the agency is asked by Congress if it has learned anything more on the issue?

More immediately, what will CIA Director-designate Mike Pompeo say during his confirmation hearings about this? He is not yet director, so he can fairly deflect any questions on the substance of this debate, for now. But every TV set at Langley will be turned on during his confirmation hearings, and his most important audience will not be the senators on the dais. His future workforce will be looking for clues about his willingness to defend them against charges of incompetence and politicization simply for saying what their craft tells them to be true.

Former CIA director Leon Panetta got great marks from the agency for standing up against elements and actions of the Obama administration when it targeted CIA officers. Case officers and analysts will be looking for evidence they will get the same from Pompeo.

And, finally, how does the intelligence community break through and explain itself to the incoming team?

Can it convincingly make a case that an evidence-based description of Russian actions is not the same thing as an attack on the legitimacy of the president-elect?

Can it explain that, unlike law enforcement that seeks to prove things beyond any reasonable doubt, the purpose of intelligence is to enable meaningful policy and action even in the face of lingering doubt?

And can it demonstrate that the incoming administration should want - rather than discourage - this to better anticipate global trends and adversarial moves in time to reflect and decide on its own actions?

As I wrote last month, intelligence should be called on to create the basis, and set the boundaries, for rational policy choices. That's still true.

The odds that it will happen, though, seem a little bleaker after this past week. And we are moving in the wrong direction.",10,Warfighting,,1,,,,The author is explicitly criticizing Trump.,73,114,2015,0.876554477,0.813213805,36.2713407,31.4835907
"McCain, John",,0,2016-12-23,,1,0,WaPO,Navy,,1,M,"We Have a Stake in Syria, Yet We Have Done Nothing","Just because America cannot stop every horror in the world does not absolve us of the responsibility of using our great power to end the worst injustices where we can, especially when doing so would benefit our own interests and make the United States and our partners more secure. We do not need to become the world's policeman to defend our interests. But we cannot wall ourselves off from the chaos of our dangerous world. And if we try, the instability, terror and destruction at the heart of that chaos will eventually make their way to our shores.","The words ""never again"" ring hollow as the city of Aleppo, Syria, has fallen to regime forces of Bashar Assad. A brutal siege that has ground on for years was finally brought to a bloody end by a surge of Russian air power, Iranian shock troops and assorted regional militia fighters. As we eulogize the dead of Aleppo, we must acknowledge the United States' complicity in this tragedy.

President Barack Obama speaks of the need to ""bear witness"" to injustice. He did little else for Aleppo. To what have we borne witness? To the use of smart bombs to target women and children, hospitals and bakeries, aid warehouses and humanitarian convoys. To the development and popularization of barrel bombs -- oil drums packed with shrapnel and explosives, dropped indiscriminately from aircraft to kill and maim as many civilians as possible. To the tactic of follow-on airstrikes designed to kill rescue workers, such as the intrepid White Helmets, who rush to the scene of an attack to save the innocent. And now to the busloads of refugees pouring out of Aleppo and the tens of thousands left behind to the tender mercies of the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian allies.

Obama has borne witness to all of this, and more, and has done nothing to stop it.

As with past atrocities, Aleppo's destruction inspired much high-minded talk and the illusion of action. Endless meetings in the gilded palaces of Geneva and Vienna and elsewhere. Red lines drawn and transgressed with no consequences. Statements like this: ""Should we really accept the notion that the world is powerless in the face of a Rwanda, or Srebrenica?"" the president asked the U.N. General Assembly in 2013. ""If that's the world that people want to live in, they should say so, and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves.""

That reckoning is now upon us. The mass graves are before us, and the name Aleppo will echo through history, like Srebrenica and Rwanda, as a testament to our moral failure and everlasting shame. Even in a conflict that has killed nearly 500,000 people, driven half of Syria's population from their homes, created the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II and spawned the terrorist army of the Islamic State -- even amid all this horror and depravity, Aleppo stands out.

Aleppo may be lost, but the war in Syria is far from over. It likely will get worse as the Assad regime, Iran, Russia, Turkey, the Kurds, the Gulf states and others intensify their fighting over what is left of Syria's carcass.

The United States still has a choice to make. The longer we wait to help end the war, the worse our options will become. But no one should believe that we have no choice.

We must acknowledge that we have a stake in what happens in Syria. It is not just about the suffering of others, as moving as that is. It is about the national security of the United States: The resurgence of al-Qaida in Syria affects us. The rise of the world's most advanced terrorist organization affects us, as we saw in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. A refugee crisis that destabilizes allies such as Israel and Jordan and threatens the foundation of Western democracies affects us.

We must also acknowledge that Assad, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Qasem Soleimani, commander of Iran's Quds Force, will never be viable counterterrorism partners. In fact, the opposite is true. The Syrian regime, Russia and Iran are not fighting the Islamic State. Their indiscriminate slaughter of Syrian civilians is what created the conditions for the Islamic State's emergence. The bloody siege of Aleppo will be a windfall for terrorist radicalization and recruitment. To think that we can destroy the Islamic State by throwing in our lot with those who are strengthening it every day is a dangerous fantasy.

Finally, we must acknowledge that ending the conflict in Syria will not be possible until Assad and his foreign backers realize they cannot succeed militarily. And make no mistake: Succeeding militarily is what they are trying to do. The fall of Aleppo will only encourage them to turn their guns on their next targets in Syria. We must recall the wisdom of former Secretary of State George Shultz: ""Diplomacy not backed by strength will always be ineffectual at best, dangerous at worst.""

Just because America cannot stop every horror in the world does not absolve us of the responsibility of using our great power to end the worst injustices where we can, especially when doing so would benefit our own interests and make the United States and our partners more secure.

To be fair, it would have been hard to explain since it was not the product of intelligence and security professionals demanding change, but rather policy, political and ideological personalities close to the president fulfilling a campaign promise to deal with a threat they had overhyped.

I've heard from a lot of intelligence professionals who are going to have to live with the consequences. They noted that six of the seven countries involved in the ban (Iran being somewhat an exception) are troubled, fragmented states where human sources are essential to defeating threats to the United States.

Paradoxically, they pointed out how the executive order breached faith with those very sources, many of whom they had promised to always protect with the full might of our government and our people. Sources who had risked much, if not all, to keep Americans safe.

I understood their angst. As CIA director, I reminded them at their case officer graduations that, when they recruited a source, they would likely be the only face of America that the source would see. And that in the act of recruitment they would assume a powerful and permanent moral responsibility for the well-being of the source and his or her loved ones.

The case officers believed that they were also empowered to offer the full faith and credit of the American nation for that task. Now, they told me, that promise was eroding.

Some will quibble that this, at least technically, is not really the case. That this is a temporary ban (maybe) and exceptions can be made (possibly). But as a former station chief told me, in the places where intelligence officers operate, rumor, whisper and conspiratorial chatter rule people's lives. It doesn't take paranoia to connect the action of the executive order with the hateful, anti-Islamic language of the campaign. In the Middle East, with its honor-based cultures, it's easier to recruit someone we have been shooting at than it is to recruit someone whose society has been insulted.

As the station chief reminded me, the fundamental posture of an intelligence service looking for sources is that ""We welcome you, you have value. Our society respects you. More than your own."" He feared that would no longer be the powerful American message it once was.

The simple idea of America didn't hurt either. The station chief said that one of the fundamentals of his business was selling the dream. The Soviets ""had a hard time with that. We had it easy. A lot of intelligence targets - officials, military figures, African revolutionaries, tribal leaders - railed against our policies, our interventions, many things ... but they loved America. It was the idea of the country as a special place. They didn't necessarily want to go there, but it was a place they kept in their minds where they would be welcome.""

The station chief and I knew Mohammed Shahwani, an Iraqi and American hero. Shawani carried the Iraqi flag at the 1960 Rome Olympics and later became a war hero as a commander of a special forces unit in the war against Iran. His popularity grew to a point where Saddam Hussein viewed him as a threat and he had to flee for his life.

Shahwani settled in Leesburg, Va., from where the United States convinced him after the invasion of Iraq to return to set up and run Iraq's post-Hussein intelligence service. A Sunni, he established a nonsectarian service that was a trusted, professional partner to the CIA and U.S. forces. Not sectarian enough for Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Shahwani was eventually sacked as U.S. influence waned.

Shahwani acted because he was an Iraqi patriot, but also because he was welcomed and sheltered by the United States, and believed he would be again.

Of course, today any members of Shahwani's family still in Iraq are forbidden to enter the United States.

My station chief asks, ""How would you look him in the eye these days and promise him we'd take care of him and the men who follow him? What do you tell him to tell those men? We'll take care of them no matter what? That our president is shoulder to shoulder with them?""

Great questions, since we are at war in Iraq today and desperately need partners of Shahwani's character.

These effects will not pass quickly. These are not short-term, transactional societies. Insults rarely just fade away. Honor patiently waits to be satisfied. In the meantime, we will be left with the weak and the merely avaricious, agents who will cut a deal just for the money, the worst kind of sources.

To all the tough-guy ideological thinkers who created this, professional CIA case officers will do what they can to deal with the unnecessary burden you have given them.

To be fair, it would have been hard to explain since it was not the product of intelligence and security professionals demanding change, but rather policy, political and ideological personalities close to the president fulfilling a campaign promise to deal with a threat they had overhyped.","In his first weeks in office, President Trump has outlined plans to reorganize the White House's National Security Council. This is in keeping with tradition: New presidents regularly reconfigure the council to fit their management style and national security priorities. Some of Mr. Trump's plans, such as including the director of the C.I.A. as a full voting member of the council, are welcome.

But some of Mr. Trump's other plans are unsettling and should be remedied as soon as possible -- in particular the role he has given to his top political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon.

What's more, according to Mr. Trump's plans for the National Security Council, neither the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation's highest-ranking military officer and the president's primary military adviser, nor the director of national intelligence, the president's primary intelligence adviser, will be a permanent member of the council's ""principals committee,"" a core group responsible for formulating policy.

President George W. Bush's council, on which I served from 2007 through 2009 as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, was arranged similarly to Mr. Trump's. But it bears noting that under President Obama, both the director of national intelligence and I were permanent members of the principals committee, codifying the importance of these positions.

In my experience there are very few -- if any -- meetings of the principals committee at which the input of the military and the intelligence community is not vital. With an increasingly belligerent Russia, tensions in the South China Sea and a smoldering Middle East, it makes little sense to minimize the participation of the professionals leading and representing these two groups.

The Trump White House insists that the new organizational structure does not downgrade the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs or the director of national intelligence. (The White House and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs, have both said that General Dunford will fully participate in the council's duties.) If this is true, the administration should clarify that by making them permanent members of the principals committee. That would send a strong signal that Mr. Trump will still take seriously the military and intelligence community.

The second much needed adjustment to Mr. Trump's arrangement of the council is the removal of Mr. Bannon from the principals committee. Putting aside for a moment Mr. Bannon's troubling public positions, which are worrisome enough, institutionalizing his attendance threatens to politicize national security decision making.

The security council was formed in 1947 to serve a unique role in our government. It facilitates and coordinates, providing a forum through which federal agencies discuss and debate policy and, ultimately, provide counsel to the president about how best to keep the American people safe. At N.S.C. meetings, representatives from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Treasury Department, the intelligence community and other agencies speak freely and critically about the full breadth of options available to the United States. Those discussions can get heated at times. They can certainly get territorial. But they seldom get political -- nor should they.

Mr. Bush understood this, as did his successor. As has been widely reported, Mr. Bush barred Karl Rove, his chief political adviser, from council meetings. And while I remember David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's political adviser, attending meetings early in that administration, he did not vote or otherwise engage in the discussion.

Having Mr. Bannon as a voting member of the principals committee will have a negative influence on what is supposed to be candid, nonpartisan deliberation. I fear that it will have a chilling effect on deliberations and, potentially, diminish the authority and the prerogatives to which Senate-confirmed cabinet officials are entitled. They, unlike Mr. Bannon, are accountable for the advice they give and the policies they execute.

Consistent though Mr. Bannon's presence may be with the predilections of our new president, it results in a blurring of presidential responsibilities -- Republican Party leader and commander in chief -- that is unhealthy for the republic.

I'm perfectly aware that political concerns color the national security decisions that any president makes. The invasion of Iraq, the surge in Afghanistan, air operations over Libya, sanctions on Russia and, of course, the decision not to strike Syria after President Bashar al-Assad crossed Mr. Obama's ""red line"" on chemical weapons were all informed -- if not dominated -- by political calculations.

But those decisions were made outside the confines of the Situation Room, where the security council meets. I cannot remember a single instance during my four-year stint as chairman of the Joint Chiefs where it was otherwise. That's the way it should be.

Every president has the right and the responsibility to shape the security council as he sees fit. But partisan politics has no place at that table. And neither does Mr. Bannon.",10,DomesticPolicy,,1,,,,The author raises concerns about who President Trump puts on the NSC.  ,72,115,2017,0.881514,0.826081061,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2017-03-09,,0,0,NYT,Air Force,,1,M,Donald Trump is Undermining Intelligence Gathering,"The relationship between a new president and the intelligence agencies that serve him can be difficult in the best of times. But it’s hard to imagine a more turbulent transition than the current one, which has been marred by assertions that the administration has tried to both politicize and marginalize intelligence gathering.","The relationship between a new president and the intelligence agencies that serve him can be difficult in the best of times. But it’s hard to imagine a more turbulent transition than the current one, which has been marred by assertions that the administration has tried to both politicize and marginalize intelligence gathering.

No White House likes it when intelligence agencies — such as the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency or the Defense Intelligence Agency — deliver bad news, or when that information undercuts the executive’s preferred policies or political positions. But I can’t remember another White House so quick to dismiss those agencies’ judgments or so willing to discredit them as dishonest or incompetent.

We’ve seen presidential tweets with “intelligence” in accusatory quotation marks, a kind of dog whistle that equates intelligence assessments with news reporting that the president condemns as “fake.” In addition to lumping the intelligence agencies in with the “dishonest” mainstream media, the president has compared his espionage services to Russians, Nazis and WikiLeaks.

Last weekend, Mr. Trump accused President Barack Obama of ordering phones at Trump Tower tapped during the 2016 campaign, a claim so outrageous that James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, denied it a day later. (So did the F.B.I. director, James Comey, according to this paper.) And last month, Mr. Trump blamed the intelligence community, along with the press, for the downfall of his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, saying on Twitter that “information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes and @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (N.S.A. and F.B.I.?).”
As the former director of both the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., I know that leaks are a real problem that can endanger national security. But why would the administration reflexively and punitively blame its own services for leaks, since we do not yet know who is responsible for them? The president has asserted that the leaking will stop “because now we have our people in,” a choice of words that creates more than a little shudder in the ranks of intelligence professionals, who prefer to work in the background for presidents, Democratic or Republican.

Mr. Trump may not appreciate the size of that community — 17 separate agencies, more than 100,000 workers, from analysts to computer programmers to case officers. So far he has put in place only Mike Pompeo, the director of the C.I.A., while his choice for director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, awaits confirmation.

He may also not appreciate that new presidents rarely make major changes to the intelligence agencies, a tradition of treating the intelligence community as apolitical professionals that has been handed down from administration to administration for decades. In 2009 only I, the director of the C.I.A., and Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, were quickly swapped out. President Obama even personally intervened to keep in place the rest of the C.I.A. team that served President George W. Bush. In 2001 President Bush replaced no one.

That apolitical spirit was reflected in Mr. Pompeo’s tribute to the professionalism and dedication of his predecessor, John Brennan, even as Mr. Trump was condemning Mr. Brennan. Mr. Pompeo’s personal closeness and access to Mr. Trump has helped the intelligence community get over some of the hard feelings generated by the president’s dismissal, even before he was elected, of its flagship product — the President’s Daily Brief — which Mr. Trump deemed unworthy of his daily attention.

But there is no evidence that Mr. Pompeo or anyone else in the community was consulted before the administration’s chaotic rollout of its original executive order banning the entry of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. (I signed a friend-of-the-court brief that said the order made America less safe.)

Even more troubling are press reports that the administration ordered intelligence agencies to build a case for why these countries represent a danger sufficient to justify the redrafted executive order. Starting with a policy and then asking intelligence professionals to provide the rationale is a corruption of a healthy process, where solid intelligence rather than campaign hyperbole should set the context for discussion.

The politicization became even more troubling when the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, cited anonymous intelligence sources to claim that the investigation into links between aides to Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia was dead. “I can assure you, and I’ve been approved to say this, that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me,” Mr. Priebus said, that the allegation “is not only grossly overstated, but also wrong.”

Mr. Priebus’s language was political, emotional and dismissive. It in no way even tried to mirror the precise phrasing of intelligence. Indeed, one intelligence official was moved to pointedly deny any involvement in drafting or approving Mr. Priebus’s specific comments, according to The Washington Post.

This is exactly where intelligence professionals do not want to be: thrust into the partisan arena of political masters who have different rules, vocabulary, goals and standards. It reminds me of the Benghazi controversy, in which the intelligence community became entangled in a sustained political fracas that led to charges that it was cooking intelligence to protect the Obama administration. I don’t envy Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Coats. They have to run complex enterprises and produce quality intelligence even as they push back against an administration that has questioned their officers’ integrity, has been casual in its use of intelligence and is not above calling on intelligence professionals to provide political cover.

And they must push back hard, because whether Mr. Trump appreciates it or not, he, and the country, need an independent intelligence enterprise, not a compliant one.",10,Warfighting,,1,,,,The author raises concerns regarding President Trump's policies and intelligence without blatantly attacking the administration.,72,115,2017,0.881514,0.826081061,36.2713407,31.4835907

Weary as some Americans may be of this long conflict, it is imperative that we see our mission through to success. We have seen what happens when we fail to be vigilant. The threats we face are real. And the stakes are high -- not just for the lives of the Afghan people and the stability of the region, but for America's national security.","On Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists murdered 3,000 innocent civilians on American soil while under the sanctuary of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. In response to that attack, U.S. and NATO forces deployed to Afghanistan to hunt down those responsible and ensure that Afghanistan would never again be a haven for terrorists. Since then, more than 2,000 Americans and more than 1,000 troops from our NATO allies have given their lives to that mission.

But after more than a decade-and-a-half of war, Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month that the war in Afghanistan is in a stalemate. President Trump and his administration must treat Afghanistan with the same urgency as the fight against the Islamic State, or this stalemate risks sliding into strategic failure.

This month, two simultaneous suicide attacks by the Taliban in Kabul killed at least 16 people and wounded more than 40. In northern Afghanistan, the Taliban overran another district. These setbacks came on the heels of disturbing losses across the country. Nicholson recently confirmed an inspector general report that the Afghan government controls or influences just 57 percent of the country's districts, down from 72 percent just over a year ago.

Make no mistake: Afghans are fighting ferociously to defend their country from our common enemies. At the same time, we must recognize that the United States is still at war in Afghanistan against the terrorist enemies who attacked our nation on Sept. 11 and their ideological heirs. We must act accordingly.

Unfortunately, in recent years, we have tied the hands of our military in Afghanistan. Instead of trying to win, we have settled for just trying not to lose.

Time and time again, we saw troop withdrawals that seemed to have more to do with U.S. politics than conditions on the ground. The fixation with ""force management levels"" in Afghanistan, as well as in Iraq and Syria, seemed more about measuring troop counts than measuring success.

Authorities were also tightly restricted. Until last summer, our military was prohibited from targeting the Taliban, except in the most extreme circumstances, taking the pressure off the militants and allowing them to rebuild and reattack. Indeed, while we were fighting the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, authorities in Afghanistan were so restrictive that it took an entire year before U.S. forces were finally given authority to strike the group's fighters in Afghanistan.

While we have settled for a ""don't lose"" strategy, the risk to U.S. and Afghan forces has only grown worse as the terrorist threat has intensified.

The Taliban has grown more lethal, expanded its territorial control and inflicted heavy casualties on Afghan forces. And it is reportedly doing so with help from Iran and Russia, who want nothing more than to see the United States fail in Afghanistan.

Al-Qaeda and the Haqqani network continue to threaten our interests in Afghanistan and beyond.

The Islamic State is trying to carve out another haven from which it can plan and execute attacks.

Moreover, U.S. efforts to confront these terrorist threats are continually frustrated by terrorist sanctuaries in Pakistan used to attack across its border and kill U.S. forces. Deteriorating relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan only make this problem more difficult.

Trump has an important opportunity to turn the page, seize the initiative and take the fight to our terrorist enemies. To do this, the United States must align ends, ways and means in Afghanistan.

The U.S. objective in Afghanistan is the same now as it was in 2001: to prevent terrorists from using the country's territory to attack our homeland.

We seek to achieve this objective by supporting Afghan governance and security institutions as they become capable of standing on their own, defending their country and defeating our common terrorist enemies with less U.S. assistance over time.

Doing this successfully requires the right number of people in the right places with the right authorities and the right capabilities. Our assessment, based on our conversations with commanders on the ground, is that a strategy for success will require additional U.S. and coalition forces and more flexible authorities. It will also require sustained support of the Afghan security forces as they develop key capabilities, especially offensive capabilities such as special operations forces and close air support needed to break the stalemate.

The United States has been at war in Afghanistan for nearly 16 years. Weary as some Americans may be of this long conflict, it is imperative that we see our mission through to success. We have seen what happens when we fail to be vigilant. The threats we face are real.

We don't have to pick one over the other.","I like to say that leadership is a choice. As our leaders in Washington confront tough decisions about our budget
priorities, I urge them to continue federal funding for public broadcasting. Public broadcasting makes our nation
smarter, stronger and, yes, safer. It's a small public investment that pays huge dividends for Americans. And it
shouldn't be pitted against spending more on improving our military. That's a false choice.
This might seem like an unlikely position for me, a 34-year combat veteran. But it's a view that has been shaped by
my career leading brave men and women who thrive and win when they are both strong and smart. My experience
has taught me that education, trusted institutions and civil discourse are the lifeblood of a great nation.
Public broadcasting plays a special role with young children. According to the Pew Research Center, rising
numbers of American children live with one parent or with two parents who both work.
My son and daughter-in-law are a two-income family with two children, and day care is a part of their lives. Many
other parents must get by without day care services. These parents are busy in the morning and busy at night. They
want to protect their children from over-commercialized content. And they strive to prepare their children for school
and lifelong learning. Having thoughtful television, games and other media that is not commercially driven is
essential to good parenting.
According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, more than half of all kids in our country do not have the opportunity
to attend a preschool program. I've also seen research that PBS local stations reach more children ages 2 to 5 than
any other children's network, and the new dedicated PBS Kids channel is the only free national programming for
children that is available anywhere and anytime.
Public television works hard to engage young learners and build the skills needed for a jump-start on life. We need
our youngest to be curious, resilient and empathetic, and prepared for the jobs of the future.
Public, noncommercial broadcasting is also giving kids social-emotional skills like persistence and self-control that
are fundamental to success in school, not to mention in the military, the institution where I spent most of my career.
In our society, I see public media as a lever. It pushes people by elevating them and their sights. It brings them
into more thinking and understanding, and it brings us together. The federal appropriation for the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting -- about $445 million annually -- supports more than a thousand television and radio stations at
a cost of about $1.35 per citizen. President Trump has proposed scrapping the corporation.
Trust among Americans and for many of our institutions is at its lowest levels in generations, and stereotyping and
prejudice have become substitutes for knowing and understanding one another as individuals.
Page 2 of 3
Save PBS. It Makes Us Safer.
How Americans restore trust may be an existential question for our country, then, but it's ultimately a practical one,
and our elected officials should advance ideas not with lamentations but with practical measures.
I've seen articles that say PBS and its member stations are ranked first in public trust among nationally known
institutions. Why then would we degrade or destroy an institution that binds us together?
We need public media that acts as our largest classroom. We need broadcasting that treats us as citizens, not
simply as consumers. We need a strong civil society where the connection between different people and groups is

Qatar hosts an important air base but also undermines American security by sponsoring Islamic radicalism.

Nearly all coalition airstrikes against Islamic State are commanded from America's nerve center at Qatar's al-Udeid Air Base, which also supports missions in Afghanistan. The U.S. Air Force stations many of its larger aircraft there -- refueling tankers, advanced surveillance and early-warning aircraft, and heavy bombers. Al-Udeid also houses the Combined Air and Space Operations Center, which commands all coalition air operations in the region. With all these key assets in one place, the Pentagon expects to stay through 2024.

But the host nation supports some of the groups the base is used to bomb. According to the State Department, ""entities and individuals within Qatar continue to serve as a source of financial support for terrorist and violent extremist groups,"" including al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. Qatar has also supplied advanced weaponry to militants in Syria and Libya.

Doha poured billions into the radical Muslim Brotherhood government of former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, who urged supporters ""to nurse our children and our grandchildren on hatred for them: for Zionists, for Jews."" The Brotherhood's supreme guide, Mohammed Badie, has called jihad against Israel and America ""a commandment of Allah that cannot be disregarded.""

After Mr. Morsi's government fell in 2013, Qatar offered safe harbor to many Brotherhood leaders. Pressure from neighbors eventually forced Doha to eject them, but Qatar still hosts Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a Brotherhood-affiliated preacher who once declared, ""Those killed fighting the American forces are martyrs."" Qatar is also a key financier of Hamas, a Palestinian spinoff of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has repeatedly attacked Israel with rockets.

Qatar wields tremendous soft power on behalf of radical Islam through its state-funded Al Jazeera news channel. Mr. Qaradawi has a weekly show, and the network became notorious in America for broadcasting Osama bin Laden's videos, repeatedly and uncut, far exceeding their news value.

Given President Trump's forthright opposition to radical Islamic terrorism, it makes sense to ask whether the U.S. should continue leasing crucial military assets from a government that supports such ideology. If Qatar won't change its behavior, the U.S. should consider relocating assets from the base. The United Arab Emirates would be a logical destination. It is an active partner in American efforts to combat ISIS, pacify Afghanistan and counter Iran. U.S. officials consider the U.A.E. one of their strongest Arab partners. Mr. Mattis has called it ""Little Sparta.""

Emirati air bases could accommodate U.S.-led operations currently run from al-Udeid, without putting U.S. aircraft farther from their targets. The Combined Air and Space Operations Center would need to be replaced, but the cost would be easily outweighed by the security benefits. The U.A.E. is a far more responsible actor than Qatar, and it already works with the U.S. military to train pilots from our other Gulf allies and coordinate coalition air operations.

If the Trump White House hopes to end the free-riding of American allies, it can start by sending a clear message to Doha: The benefits of al-Udeid do not outweigh Qatar's support for extremism.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,72,115,2017,0.881514,0.826081061,36.2713407,31.4835907

Understandably, that attitude led to a strained relationship with the intelligence community, a state of affairs not helped by the president's unfounded, yet continuing, accusations that the community spied on his campaign.

Now the Russians are front and center in another controversy, this one fully of the president's making. Last week, according to The Post, the president disclosed highly sensitive intelligence on the Islamic State to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during an Oval Office meeting.

The information reportedly derived from another country's intelligence service, so its revelation would have violated the near-sacred third-party rule of intelligence: Information from one country cannot be shared with another without the agreement of the originator. Break that rule often enough and your intelligence begins to dry up.

The administration contends that neither sources nor methods were discussed. That may be true enough, but I have had many arguments with journalists trying to explain that revealing the ""fact of"" something often points the way to the ""fact how"" - to the very sources and methods they claim they are not threatening.

Of course, the president has absolute declassification authority and, in practice, should have great leeway in what he wants to share with other nations. The issue here is not the power of a president but the performance of this president.

Governing is new turf for Trump. He is one of the least experienced presidents in the nation's history. There is no evidence of scholarship or even deep interest in the processes of U.S. government. He has little international knowledge beyond real estate and business.

But even with such a thin portfolio, he seems incapable of humility in the face of such inexperience. By all accounts, the president is impatient with process and study, preternaturally confident in his own knowledge and instincts, and indifferent to, and perhaps contemptuous of, the institutions of government designed to help him succeed.

We saw this coming in the transition when a self-confident president-elect contacted foreign leaders without benefit of briefings from, or even the knowledge of, the State Department.

So, little wonder that an impulsive president appears to have gone off script to warn his Russian visitors in dramatic fashion. Or was it to impress them with the prowess of his intelligence services?

Once again, the White House circled the wagons. National security adviser H.R. McMaster and deputy adviser Dina Powell, both of whom I know and regard highly, stated that the president had not specifically revealed sources and methods and asserted that the Post article was ""false.""

Debates over what exactly the president said or did not say were made moot, though, when the president tweeted that he could damn well do what he pleased in these circumstances.

McMaster and Powell could not have been comfortable being thrust into this position. One hopes that they are not put there very often.

Indeed, there is a creeping corruption near the president as his spokespeople are frequently forced to defend that which should not be defended. The national security team can't allow itself to be touched by that.

Then there is the question of the leak itself. Who told The Post - and, very quickly, other news organizations - about the meeting? The president's defenders are already pointing to dark elements of the deep state or to holdovers from the Obama administration.

Maybe, but there are alternative explanations. There may have been more here than just malice or obstructionism.

Reportedly, National Security Council staffers were concerned enough about the revelations that they felt compelled to warn the CIA and the National Security Agency. Clearly, someone in government was concerned about potential damage. Once that word was out, it's not hard to imagine the alarm among government professionals increasingly uneasy about managing the consequences of what they see as presidential missteps.

The administration will probably try to hunt down some of those folks, at least those who talked to The Post. Leaks are leaks, after all. But one hopes they also turn considerable attention to making our president more knowledgeable and prepared - and more open to the processes and protocols that have governed the behavior of others who have held that high office",10,DomesticPolicy,,1,,,,The author strongly criticizes Trump. ,72,115,2017,0.881514,0.826081061,36.2713407,31.4835907

But it will be sustainable and it can improve the prospects of shoring up our eastern flank in the broader battle against Islamist extremism -- a fight that likely is to be a generational struggle.","Can the U.S. succeed in Afghanistan? Not without a sustained, and sustainable, commitment. President Trump's decision to give Defense Secretary Jim Mattis the authority to add several thousand more U.S. troops to the 8,400 currently deployed is encouraging -- but only if it is a first step in a comprehensive approach.

Army Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, should also receive greater leeway in the use of U.S. and NATO air power. And officials should remain open to the possibility of reconciliation with some insurgents, probably just those that break off from the central Taliban.

An intensified military effort could arrest the gradual loss of territory held by the government in recent years -- now estimated by U.S. Central Command at only 60% of the country -- and to regain battlefield momentum. Congress should enable all this by appropriating the $5 billion or so a year above current levels that such a strategy will require.

America's leaders should not lose sight of why the U.S. went to, and has stayed in, Afghanistan: It is in our national interest to ensure that country is not once again a sanctuary for transnational extremists, as it was when the 9/11 attacks were planned there. We have been accomplishing that mission since the intervention began in October 2001. Although al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is diminished, it could rebound if given the opportunity. Islamic State could expand its newfound Afghan foothold as well.

The augmented troop levels Mr. Trump has authorized would be only 12% to 15% of the peak U.S. force levels, in 2010-11. The country can sustain that level of commitment. While all casualties are tragic, our losses in Afghanistan would likely remain far fewer than the losses from another major terrorist attack in the U.S.

Today the U.S. and its coalition partners lack the capacity to train and assist Afghan forces adequately in the field. As recently as 2015, the allied forces did not even have a full-time advisory presence for the main Afghan army corps in Helmand province. Largely as a result, the Taliban gained control of much of the province. Nor did the coalition have adequate advisers to help the smaller Afghan formations near Kunduz before that city fell to the Taliban in 2015. It was later liberated only at high cost, especially to Afghan forces and civilians. Restrictions on coalition air power reduced America's ability to help Afghan partners.

Adding some 3,000 to 5,000 U.S. and allied troops could provide the capacity for several dozen deployable mentoring teams. That is far from enough to assist each Afghan brigade or battalion. But it could support the units that are engaged in the toughest fights and are most intensively involved in rebuilding their capabilities. Supporting those teams logistically and with air power, and providing quick-reaction forces in several parts of the country to help them if they get in trouble, would drive additional requirements for coalition troops into the low thousands.

On the civilian side, President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah need to continue their efforts against corruption, which have shown gradual, modest results to date. With U.S. help, they need to reform the electoral commissions that will oversee parliamentary and presidential elections over the next two years.

Then there is Pakistan, where the U.S. needs a tougher approach. Washington reduced aid to Islamabad by more than half over the past five years. More can be cut. President Trump and Congress could also designate Pakistani individuals and organizations supporting the Taliban and impose sanctions on them. The U.S. could show less restraint in striking Taliban targets within Pakistan.

There are carrots available too: trade concessions, increased aid, more assistance to the Pakistani army's fight against internal extremists, dialogue with New Delhi to mitigate Pakistan's worries about India's role in Afghanistan. But these must come on the condition that Islamabad put greater pressure on the Taliban (whose headquarters is in the Quetta area) and on the Haqqani insurgent network (in North Waziristan). None of this will work unless Pakistani leaders recognize that allowing these groups' leaders sanctuary on their soil is foolish and dangerous. Given the way extremist groups collaborate in Central and South Asia, that approach will inevitably continue to backfire. After all, the greatest existential threat Pakistan faces is internal extremism, not India.

President Trump's early approach holds promise. In Afghanistan today, the military needs to revisit the phase of the mission it largely skipped in the years after the surge of 2010-12 or so, when it downsized too quickly and too far. This approach will not achieve ""victory"" in Afghanistan, after which all troops can be withdrawn. That is an impossible goal in the near-term.

The committees and chambers at large soon will make a decision of vital importance with respect to the veteran and military communities and the public at large: They will decide how we will memorialize those who have made the ultimate sacrifice over the past 16 years of sustained combat.

The committee will determine whether now is the time to authorize a National Memorial for the Global War on Terrorism.

By building a National Global War on Terrorism Memorial, we would forever preserve the memory of those we have lost in the fighting that followed Sept. 11, 2001, continues today and will continue into the foreseeable future. It will be the first national memorial in Washington authorized for an ongoing war. The men and women it would recognize volunteered from every race, creed and religion and from home towns across our great country. This memorial would stand as a place to educate our country about selfless service and sacrifice. It would inspire future generations of heroes in service to our nation. It would help connect members of our civilian population who too often are unaware of what its warriors are asked to sacrifice when they defend our freedoms.

How would a physical memorial do these things? We need look no further than our existing national war memorials on the Mall to understand. For 35 years, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has stood as a source of healing and pride for the country and for the generation of veterans who fought in Vietnam. Veterans, some of whom were treated very poorly by their countrymen upon their return from war, take solace in the communal healing space the Wall provides. The Korean War Veterans Memorial gave veterans of the ""Forgotten War"" much-needed recognition of their service, which was largely overlooked. The World War II generation was welcomed home as victors with ticker-tape parades all across our nation. It took our nation 59 years to formally recognize the Greatest Generation with a national memorial. It is an inspiring and moving experience to witness a group of WWII veterans come to see their national memorial.

The impact of these memorials extends beyond the warfighters themselves. It also provides a common bonding place for families of the fallen to grieve. Memorial Day is a day that we come together as a nation to remember our loved ones lost in war. However, for the widows, children and Gold Star family members of our service members lost in today's war, there is no communal space for them to collectively pay tribute to their loved ones lost fighting on our nation's behalf except Arlington National Cemetery's Section 60. This memorial would change that.

While these memorials have been places of great healing for the veterans and families of previous wars, they also have been great sources of education for younger generations of Americans. Every spring and fall in our nation's capital, you will find children on school field trips who have traveled from around the country walking around the Mall. They learn why they are standing before 58,300 names inscribed on a dark granite wall or in front of a grand fountain that recognizes a generation of Americans who saved the world from tyranny. Walking on hallowed ground, our citizenry gains an understanding of the effect these periods of history had on our country.

People often ask, ""Why now?"" We are in the longest sustained combat in our history. The warriors who shouldered the burden of war for the past 16 years, and the families who stood alongside them, should not have to wait 59 years to be recognized in our nation's capital.

If the investigation proves extensive Chinese government support for intellectual-property theft, it could trigger retaliatory action by the American government, based on the Economic Espionage Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the National Defense Authorization Act.","President Trump on Monday instructed the office of the United States Trade Representative to consider an investigation into China’s sustained and widespread attacks on America’s intellectual property. This investigation will provide the evidence for holding China accountable for a decades-long assault on the intellectual property of the United States and its allies.

For too long, the United States has treated China as a developing nation to be coaxed and lectured, while tolerating its bad behavior as merely growing pains. There has been an expectation that as China’s economy matures, it will of its own accord adopt international standards in commerce, including protection for intellectual property. There has also been a tendency to excuse mercantilist behavior, including industrial espionage, as a passing phase, and to justify inaction as necessary to secure Chinese cooperation on other, supposedly more important, issues.

Chinese companies, with the encouragement of official Chinese policy and often the active participation of government personnel, have been pillaging the intellectual property of American companies. All together, intellectual-property theft costs America up to $600 billion a year, the greatest transfer of wealth in history. China accounts for most of that loss.

Intellectual-property theft covers a wide spectrum: counterfeiting American fashion designs, pirating movies and video games, patent infringement and stealing proprietary technology and software. This assault saps economic growth, costs Americans jobs, weakens our military capability and undercuts a key American competitive advantage — innovation.

Chinese companies have stolen trade secrets from virtually every sector of the American economy: automobiles, auto tires, aviation, chemicals, consumer electronics, electronic trading, industrial software, biotech and pharmaceuticals. Last year U.S. Steel accused Chinese hackers of stealing trade secrets related to the production of lightweight steel, then turning them over to Chinese steel makers.

Perhaps most concerning, China has targeted the American defense industrial base. Chinese spies have gone after private defense contractors and subcontractors, national laboratories, public research universities, think tanks and the American government itself. Chinese agents have gone after the United States’ most significant weapons, such as the F-35 Lightning, the Aegis Combat System and the Patriot missile system; illegally exported unmanned underwater vehicles and thermal-imaging cameras; and stolen documents related to the B-52 bomber, the Delta IV rocket, the F-15 fighter and even the Space Shuttle.

President Trump’s action on Monday acknowledges the broad scope of the challenge. Central to Chinese cybersecurity law is the “secure and controllable” standard, which, in the name of protecting software and data, forces companies operating in China to disclose critical intellectual property to the government and requires that they store data locally. Even before this Chinese legislation, some three-quarters of Chinese imported software was pirated. Now, despite the law, American companies may be even more vulnerable.

For decades, successive American administrations have concluded that some level of exposure to China’s depredations against our intellectual property is simply the cost of doing business with the world’s now second-largest economy. This is not acceptable. Although China is an important trading partner with the United States, it is imperative to establish a fair and level trading environment.

Driving down intellectual-property theft by China and other countries is vital for America’s economic well-being and national security. We urge American companies, as well as our allies abroad, who share these interests, to work with the administration through this process.

There is intellectual-property protection on the books in China, and some American companies have been successful bringing cases in Chinese courts. The time may come when China applies the same efforts to protecting intellectual property that it now does to stealing it. However, for now, the United States and other developed countries must look to their own laws and actions to protect their companies from loss and ruin.

President Trump’s action on Monday is a major step in the right direction. If the investigation proves extensive Chinese government support for intellectual-property theft, it could trigger retaliatory action by the American government, based on the Economic Espionage Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the National Defense Authorization Act.

The government should lead in this effort, but it can’t go it alone. A broad, sustained campaign bringing together the government, the private sector and our allies is the only way to halt this hemorrhaging of America’s economic life blood.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,72,115,2017,0.881514,0.826081061,36.2713407,31.4835907

","Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe says there was no way to prepare for the fatal car attack in Charlottesville. I disagree.

After the shootings in Dallas, Orlando and many others, I argued for stronger programs to identify killers. The perpetrators come in different shapes and sizes -- white supremacists, gang members or radical Islamists. But they have common characteristics: individuals with worrisome backgrounds, including domestic abuse, violent misdemeanors, and drug and alcohol abuse.

The little information we have on James Fields Jr., the alleged driver of the car that killed Heather Heyer, corroborates that picture. The Washington Post reported that his mother had called 911 to alert authorities to his potential danger. He had been taking medication for schizophrenia. His high school history teacher was alarmed by his neo-Nazi views and writings. Fields enlisted in the Army after graduation but was discharged in four months and had not completed basic training.

As a retired Army general and clinical psychiatrist, I know that his discharge marks him as likely being a troubled young man. Fields was probably released from basic training when it became apparent he suffered from a pre-existing serious mental illness that disqualified him.

Fields was sent off to be someone else's problem, as we have all so sadly learned. This is not a slam against the Army, but a criticism across the board for our failure as a country to tackle mental health problems, particularly in our young people, and enact programs and treatments to protect against violence.

The overriding debate about white supremacy has marginalized the core issue of personal violence. This is especially worrisome when we are having a national debate about health care and funding for it. Proposed Medicaid cuts would hit hard at mental health coverage. Personal violence goes beyond ideology and political convictions. It is an issue of mental state and potential for dangerous behavior. More often than not, the perpetrators have left telltale signs that they are threats -- evidence of domestic abuse, harassment and open statements endorsing violence.

Any research has to tiptoe around the gun lobby that is systematically opposed to funding it. It takes courage for politicians to risk their careers and act against individual violence that could involve access to guns. Ironically, it is more politically savvy to talk about racism, white supremacy and social problems. But talking about those issues -- as important and compelling as they are -- doesn't protect us from the lethal perpetrator next door.

We need to support community-based programs that bring together the health clinics, mental health services, law enforcement, schools and social agencies to identify problems and intervene as soon as they arise.

Coupled with the congressional defense authorization, this would send a strong message to countries and criminals that the pillaging of our oceans is a serious threat to the United States — one that we must confront.","Lawmakers are finally catching up to something that the Navy and Coast Guard have known for a long time: The escalating conflict over fishing could lead to a ""global fish war.""

This week, as part of the pending National Defense Authorization Act, Congress asked the Navy to help fight illegal fishing. This is an important step. Greater military and diplomatic efforts must follow. Indeed, history is full of natural-resource wars, including over sugar, spices, textiles, minerals, opium and oil. Looking at current dynamics, fish scarcity could be the next catalyst.

The decline in nearly half of global fish stocks in recent decades is a growing and existential threat to roughly 1 billion people around the world who rely on seafood as their primary source of protein. No other country is more concerned about the increasingly empty oceans than China, whose people eat twice as much fish as the global average. Beijing is also the world's largest exporter of fish, with 14 million fishers in a sector producing billions of dollars a year.

In order to keep its people fed and employed, the Chinese government provides hundreds of millions of dollars a year in subsidies to its distant-water fishing fleet. And in the South China Sea, it is common for its ships to receive Chinese Coast Guard escorts when illegally entering other countries' fishing waters. As such, the Chinese government is directly enabling and militarizing the worldwide robbing of ocean resources.

The deployment of both hard and soft power to acquire natural resources is nothing short of hybrid warfare. Countries on the receiving end of Chinese actions are responding in kind: Indonesia has blown up hundreds of vessels fishing in their waters illegally; Argentina sank a Chinese vessel illegally fishing in its waters last year; and South Africa continues to clash with Beijing over fishing practices. Recently, Ecuador summoned the Chinese ambassador to condemn China's fishing in Ecuadoran maritime territory following the seizure of 300 tons of illegally sourced fish.

The United States could be next. Chinese vessels are increasingly fishing near our waters and are seeking to expand their footprint in the Caribbean. U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Jay Caputo recently underscored this point: ""It is imperative that the Coast Guard be prepared for when the Chinese fishing militia approaches the U.S. [exclusive economic zone].""

Emptier oceans also lead to increased transnational crimes. The commander of the Navy's 5th Fleet noted this year that ""out-of-work fishermen"" are often involved in weapons smuggling for countries such as Iran. Drug traffickers also use fishing vessels around the world, including U.S. waters. This summer in Miami, U.S. Customs and Border Protection interdicted a fishing vessel from the Bahamas carrying 150 pounds of cocaine. These practices are rampant in Central and South America.

Dozens of international treaties govern the protection of marine resources, but significant enforcement gaps exist that substantially reduce their effectiveness. The U.S. Navy is better suited to help close this gap than any other institution in the world. And while the Navy already recognized in its 2015 strategic blueprint that combating illegal fishing is part of its mission, the recent congressional action provides an opportunity for the Navy and partners to increase its role.

To that end, the Navy should expand its partnership with the Coast Guard through the Oceania Maritime Security Initiative, which allows both military branches to enforce fisheries laws, combat transnational organized crime and enhance regional security in the Central and South Pacific. This program should be replicated in other ocean territories.

The United States can also revitalize efforts by including fighting illegal fishing as part of the mission of the Combined Maritime Forces, a voluntary maritime security initiative with 32 member nations that operates to combat terrorism and piracy and provide overall maritime security. Fighting illegal fishing is not part of the group's mission, but in light of the geostrategic challenges associated with it today, member countries should reconsider its inclusion.

Diplomatic efforts must be increased as well, starting with elevating environmental-crime issues, such as illegal fishing, within the U.S. government. President Trump began that process this year by incorporating wildlife crime as part of an executive order on combating transnational organized crime.

Trump should also recognize illegal fishing as a direct threat to U.S. interests in his National Security Strategy this fall. Coupled with the congressional defense authorization, this would send a strong message to countries and criminals that the pillaging of our oceans is a serious threat to the United States — one that we must confront.

Shutting out refugees would not only increase human suffering; it would also weaken the country and undermine its foreign policy.","Amid the world's worst migrant crisis on record, the Trump administration is cutting back on refugee resettlement. As part of his travel ban, President Trump capped the number of refugees to be admitted in 2017 at 50,000, the lowest number in decades. Now the administration has proposed lowering the goal even further, to 45,000, next year.

Over the years, the United States has lived up to its ideals and brought millions of refugees to safety and freedom. It didn't become a resettlement leader out of pure altruism. By welcoming refugees, the United States revitalizes its democracy and its economy, helps preserve or restore stability in volatile regions of the world, and builds respect.

In slashing resettlement, the president is taking a recklessly narrow view of how best to put America first. Shutting out refugees would not only increase human suffering; it would also weaken the country and undermine its foreign policy.

There are more than 22 million refugees in the world, the highest number since World War II. Even before the Trump presidency, the United States response to this crisis was relatively modest. In fiscal year 2016, the United States resettled about 84,000 refugees, the most of any year under President Barack Obama. For comparison's sake, the country took in roughly 200,000 refugees a year in the early 1980s under President Ronald Reagan.

Nonetheless, the resettlement effort under President Obama served American interests. For one thing, it helped the states that host the vast majority of Syrian refugees: Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon. (In fiscal year 2016, 12,500 of the refugees resettled by the United States came from Jordan, a key American ally in a strategically crucial region.) The huge influx of refugees into these nations has strained their resources and infrastructure, becoming a potential source of instability and even conflict. By resettling refugees, the United States helps preserve stability and sends a message of support to countries whose cooperation it needs on a range of issues.

The Trump administration's cuts to resettlement send the exact opposite message. It is a message heard across the region, by enemies as wells as friends of the United States. Restricting resettlement, especially in the context of the travel ban, appears to validate the propaganda of the Islamic State and other extremist groups, which claims that the United States is hostile to Muslims. The battle against violent extremism must be fought with guns, but also with ideas. Slamming the door on refugees is a significant strategic blunder.

Opponents of refugee resettlement would have you believe that the country's enemies are exploiting the program. There is no factual basis for this claim. In fact, of all the people who enter the United States, refugees are the most thoroughly vetted. The screening process is exhaustive and lengthy, and involves numerous agencies. Our intelligence and national security professionals can both vet refugees and protect Americans. Indeed, they've done just that for years.

Refugees are victims of extremist groups and brutal governments. They become patriotic, hard-working Americans. Refugees are us. They are teachers, police officers, doctors, factory workers and soldiers. There are thousands of former refugees and children of refugees in the United States military. I served alongside many who were eager and proud to give back to the country that helped them in their time of need.

It's no wonder that numerous studies have found that refugees are a net benefit to the American economy. The administration's own study -- which the president solicited from the Department of Health and Human Resources -- concluded that refugees added $63 billion to the economy between 2005 and 2014.

Support for refugees creates another form of currency for the United States. Call it respect or admiration or credibility, this currency accrues when the United States leads by example and champions human rights on the world stage. It's an invaluable and fungible resource, amassed over many decades. It enables the United States to forge ties with democratic movements. It also helps Washington persuade allies to do difficult things and pressure foes to stop their bad behavior. It is crucial to forging trade pacts, military coalitions and peace deals.

That is why Americans need to care about what is going on in the Middle East right now. That is why we need to stick with our true friends, like the Kurds. And that is why, now more than ever, we need a strategy that lifts our sights above the tactical level and separates the urgent from the truly important.","CLASHES this month between elements of the Iraqi security forces and Kurdish fighters around Kirkuk are deeply troubling, in particular because of the United States' longstanding friendship with the Kurdish people. These clashes are also emblematic of a broader, more troubling reality: Beyond our tactical successes in the fight against the Islamic State, the United States is still dangerously lacking a comprehensive strategy toward the rest of the Middle East in all of its complexity.

This is the unfortunate legacy that the Obama administration left for its successor. President Trump's call this month for a broader strategy to confront Iran's malign influence across the Middle East was an encouraging indication that the administration recognises the problem.

But just days after that speech, reports surfaced that Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force, was near Kirkuk, preparing military advances on Kurdish positions by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias to augment the broader efforts of Iraqi security forces. When those advances came, some Iraqi forces, according to reports, fought with equipment that had been provided by the United States.

This is totally unacceptable. The United States offered arms and training to the government of Iraq to fight the Islamic State and secure Iraq from external threats not to attack Iraqi Kurds, who are some of America's most trusted and capable partners in the region.

For decades, the United States' alliance with the Kurds has protected them from attacks, both from within and outside Iraq, while furthering American national security interests. In the past few years, the Kurds have become even closer allies, fighting alongside the United States against the Islamic State.

Let me be clear: If Baghdad cannot guarantee the Kurdish people in Iraq the security, freedom and opportunities they desire, and if the United States is forced to choose between Iranian-backed militias and our longstanding Kurdish partners, I choose the Kurds.

The clashes in Kirkuk are symptomatic of a deeper problem that the United States has failed to address for many years: Both within countries and between them, the regional order in the Middle East is rapidly collapsing. American power and influence is diminishing there, largely because over the past eight years the United States has withdrawn from the region. The resulting vacuum is being filled by anti-American forces.

While the current administration, like its predecessor, remains singularly focused on defeating the Islamic State which is, of course, essential our adversaries are taking advantage of us everywhere else.

In Iraq, the United States seems to still be basking in the feeling of victory after the liberation of Mosul this summer. Meanwhile, Iranian forces are working to sow discord inside Iraq, as we saw in Kirkuk; manoeuvre Iraqi politics against the United States; and turn next year's election into a strategic setback that drives American influence out of the country.

Across the border in Syria, the Assad regime, backed by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and an array of militias, has retaken most of the country, including many eastern areas that the United States has identified as strategically important. The future of Syria is being determined by force on the ground with little American initiative.

A web of Iranian proxies and allies is spreading from the Levant to the Arabian Peninsula, threatening stability, freedom of navigation and the territory of our partners and allies, including with advanced conventional weapons. Iran itself continues to test ballistic missiles, menace its neighbors and use its sanctions relief windfall to harmful ends.

Our Arab allies are absorbed in a diplomatic dispute with Qatar in the face of far more pressing threats. And behind all this is the shadow of Vladimir Putin's Russia, which is re-establishing itself as a regional power broker actively hostile to American interests and wholly unconcerned about human rights or civilian life.

This is a complicated and confusing set of problems, to be sure. But Americans need to understand the greater challenge: The Middle East is vitally important to the future of international security and the global economy, both of which benefit the American people. And right now, a network of anti-American groups at times working together, at times on their own is trying to drive American influence out of the Middle East and to remake the region in ways that are contrary to our interests and values. They are doing so by supporting terrorists and militias, subverting and intimidating our friends, displacing us diplomatically, and deploying and distributing military technology that makes it harder and more dangerous for the United States to maintain its presence.

If we keep sleepwalking on our current trajectory, we could wake up in the near future and find that American influence has been pushed out of one of the most important parts of the world. That is why Americans need to care about what is going on in the Middle East right now. That is why we need to stick with our true friends, like the Kurds.

"Cartwright, James and Perry, William ",2011,1,2017-11-17,,0,0,WaPO,Marine Corps,,,M,We Can Cut Back Our Nuclear Arsenal,"We should consider all aspects of our nuclear posture and our conventional forces' needs before rushing headlong into these expensive and contentious development programs. We believe, too, that taking a more prudent course in rebuilding our deterrent systems could help avoid a new arms race with Russia that neither side should want","The United States plans to spend $1.7 trillion over the next three decades to replace its nuclear arsenal. This is a lot of money, more annually than the country spends on the entire State Department. Even so, if we thought this level of spending were required to ensure U.S. national security, we would support it. It is not. The nation can spend much less and still be safe. In fact, safer.

This may sound counterintuitive, but if we scale back plans to replace the nuclear arsenal, we will actually improve our security. And we will save hundreds of billions of dollars.

How can this be? Current plans call for building new nuclear weapons as if the Cold War had never ended. This is dangerous. In the past, we lived with great risks that, at the time, we thought were justified. No longer. It is time to take a hard look at the arsenal and replace the weapons we need for today's threats - and forgo the rest.

We support a strong U.S. nuclear deterrent as long as nuclear weapons are held by other nations. But we do not support replacing every weapon in the arsenal. At a time of tight defense budgets, a dollar spent on nuclear weapons is a dollar taken away from other military needs, such as sustaining conventional forces and countering terrorism and cyberattacks. The United States cannot afford to do it all.

During the Cold War, the greatest danger to the United States was a ""bolt from the blue"" from the Soviet Union - a massive surprise nuclear attack. We armed ourselves to the teeth to prevent this. Thankfully, those days are over. The Soviet Union disappeared 25 years ago. Current Russian belligerence, although worrisome, does not constitute a renewed Cold War.

Today, the greatest danger is not a Russian bolt but a U.S. blunder - that we might accidentally stumble into nuclear war. As we make decisions about which weapons to buy, we should use this simple rule: If a nuclear weapon increases the risk of accidental war and is not needed to deter an intentional attack, we should not build it.

The Cold War arsenal includes intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarines, long-range bombers, cruise missiles and the nuclear warheads they carry. Last month, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that maintaining and replacing the arsenal over 30 years would cost $1.2 trillion in constant dollars, or $1.7 trillion with inflation. The CBO's new cost estimate is much higher than previous ones and should be a wake-up call that current plans must be rethought.

We support building an appropriate number of new nuclear-armed submarines as the most survivable leg of the deterrent. No adversary could believe that a surprise attack would destroy all of our at-sea submarines. And any one of them (carrying as many as 192 thermonuclear warheads) is capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on that adversary. Thus our submarines alone give us an assured deterrence.

Moreover, because the submarines are not vulnerable to a first strike, there is no reason to launch their missiles under warning of attack. This avoids serious concerns about accidental war that are inherent to ICBMs, which certainly would be the first targets of any surprise attack and cannot be recalled should they be launched in response to what turns out to be a false alarm. This is not a theoretical problem. We had three false alarms during the Cold War, and on one of those, we narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe.

As an insurance policy in case submarine survivability becomes threatened, we also support an appropriate number of new stealth bombers, which would be used primarily for conventional missions but could also be armed with nuclear gravity bombs now being rebuilt. Bombers could be sent into the air in a crisis, and, once there, could loiter for many hours, allowing them to wait out an alarm while airborne.

It is time to step back and take a fresh look. The United States does not need to arm its bombers with a new generation of nuclear-armed cruise missiles. We should no longer run the risk that a conventionally armed cruise missile might be mistaken for one with a nuclear warhead, thus starting a nuclear war by mistake. According to the CBO, canceling this weapon would save $30 billion. Similarly, the United States should cancel plans to replace its ground-based ICBMs, which would save $149 billion.

We should consider all aspects of our nuclear posture and our conventional forces' needs before rushing headlong into these expensive and contentious development programs. We believe, too, that taking a more prudent course in rebuilding our deterrent systems could help avoid a new arms race with Russia that neither side should want.

Certain nuclear weapons, such as the cruise missile and the ICBM, carry higher risks of accidental war that, fortunately, we no longer need to bear. We are safer without these expensive weapons, and it would be foolish to replace them. With nuclear weapons, as with all things, sometimes less is more.",10,BdgtWpnsTrps,,,,,,,72,115,2017,0.881514,0.826081061,36.2713407,31.4835907
"McPeak, Merrill",1994,1,2017-12-26,,0,0,NYT,Air Force,,,M,Bombing the Ho Chi Minh Trail; Vietnam '67,"We never stopped traffic, never got the job done, a fact that bothers me to this day. Our technical deficiencies — inability to operate at night, inaccuracy of unguided munitions — have since been corrected. But when Saigon fell, it was not a swarm of ragtag Vietcong guerrillas who overran the city, but columns of Russian-made T-54 tanks, leading a modern field army complete with artillery and surface-to-air missiles, all delivered by those tough-guy truck drivers down that seemingly indestructible Ho Chi Minh Trail.","I spent 1967 flying air shows with the Thunderbirds, the Air Force aerobatic team, and worrying the war in Vietnam would be over before I got there. All my fighter pilot buddies were in the thick of it, and here I was in front of friendly crowds instead of enemy troops — recruiting duty instead of combat — and in an assignment I couldn’t leave before completing a two-year tour.

I needn’t have worried; the war would wait for me. When my turn came, I logged 269 sorties, many of them highly classified because we weren’t supposed to be flying over Laos. But we were, and my outfit’s job was to stop traffic down the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

Interestingly, the North Vietnamese didn’t call it the Ho Chi Minh Trail. It twisted through the Truong Son Mountains of the Central Highlands, which run nearly the length of Vietnam along its border with Laos and Cambodia. For the North, the trail was either the Truong Son Strategic Supply Route, or Highway 559, numerals that memorialized the month (May) and year (1959) the government of North Vietnam reached a formal decision to provide active support to the insurrection in the South.

Hanoi could never have sustained military operations in the South without a way to send men and supplies into the region. Of course, neither could we. We built an impressive, modern infrastructure — air bases, port facilities, pipelines, the huge supply depot at Long Binh.

Meanwhile, starting in the late 1950s, North Vietnam appropriated a piece of Laotian real estate the size of Massachusetts and constructed an infrastructure that in many ways mirrored ours: hundreds of miles of road, communications centers, ammo dumps, stockpiles of food and fuel, truck parks, troop bivouacs. The North Vietnamese did this in a much more difficult environment: a sparsely populated region of rugged mountains, triple-canopy jungle and dense primeval rain forest. It was one of history’s great achievements in military engineering, and all of it hidden from sight except for the trace of the road itself.

I was assigned to a small unit manned by volunteers from all four of the bases in South Vietnam that housed F-100 fighter-bombers, the plane of choice for the mission. Technically, we were the “detachment” of a regular fighter squadron, our identity cloaked because of the secrecy of the work. Others knew us by our call sign, Misty. The job: find and direct attacks on all elements of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

We wanted to blow it all up, the trucks and supplies and infrastructure, but what we could see was the road itself. So we attacked choke points, thinking we’d do the next best thing and block the way. But the next day, bypasses appeared. We rolled avalanches into the roadbed, and the trail somehow slithered around them. We made mud and soon found corduroy. We cratered fords that somehow filled up and widened.

More a maze than a road, the trail disappeared, returned to view, dissolved, emerged, contracted, expanded, split, reunited, vanished, materialized. We blasted a big chunk of Laos, the 600-year-old monarchy, the Land of a Million Elephants, to bony, lunar dust. Yet somehow the Ho Chi Minh Trail, itself the enemy, was always there. Killing it was like trying to put socks on an octopus.

The truckers themselves were much admired by Misty. Their side called them “pilots of the ground,” the metaphor causing no offense. We invented a teasing song about them — about how lonely it was on the trail; how bad the food was when they got any; how they jacked it up to change tires, slippin’ and slidin’ in the mud; how they picked bugs out of their teeth when Misty shot holes in their windshields.

But they did deadly serious work in the most dreadful conditions imaginable. They left their homes in the North and lived on the trail for months, even years, enduring monsoon weather, malaria, animal bites and constant hunger. Their mail was collected once a month; an exchange of letters could take a whole season.

Then, they got to navigate through desolate countryside, in the dark, without headlights — a drive that would be no fun on an open, modern highway, nobody shooting at you.

We dropped two million tons of bombs on Laos — something like our total tonnage during all of World War II in both the European and Pacific theaters. We seeded clouds to induce flooding, sprayed Agent Orange, mined the road, installed sensors along the electronic-monitoring McNamara Line . No doubt about it, we extracted a heavy price. In time, the North filled 72 military cemeteries with the remains of those who built, manned and moved over the trail.

But move they did, putting through the cargo — the 122-milimeter rockets that pounded our Marines around Danang, the mines that killed our soldiers near the Parrot’s Beak, the heavy equipment that in the end would surround and capture the Saigon of memory. Pumping hard, the truckers provided the oxygen sustaining the North’s ability to make war in the South.

We never stopped traffic, never got the job done, a fact that bothers me to this day. Our technical deficiencies — inability to operate at night, inaccuracy of unguided munitions — have since been corrected. But when Saigon fell, it was not a swarm of ragtag Vietcong guerrillas who overran the city, but columns of Russian-made T-54 tanks, leading a modern field army complete with artillery and surface-to-air missiles, all delivered by those tough-guy truck drivers down that seemingly indestructible Ho Chi Minh Trail.",10,Support,,,,,,,72,115,2017,0.881514,0.826081061,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Wilkerson, Lawrence ",,1,2018-02-06,,0,0,NYT,Army,,,M,A Familiar Road to War,"The sole purpose of our actions was to sell the American people on the case for war with Iraq. Polls show that we did. Mr. Trump and his team are trying to do it again. If we're not careful, they'll succeed.","Fifteen years ago this week, Colin Powell, then the secretary of state, spoke at the United Nations to sell pre-emptive war with Iraq. As his chief of staff, I helped Secretary Powell paint a clear picture that war was the only choice, that when ""we confront a regime that harbors ambitions for regional domination, hides weapons of mass destruction and provides haven and active support for terrorists, we are not confronting the past, we are confronting the present. And unless we act, we are confronting an even more frightening future.""

Following Mr. Powell's presentation on that cold day, I considered what we had done. At the moment, I thought all our work was for naught -- and despite his efforts we did not gain substantial international buy-in. But polls later that day and week demonstrated he did convince many Americans. I knew that was why he was chosen to make the presentation in the first place: his standing with the American people was more solid than that of any other member of the Bush administration.

President George W. Bush would have ordered the war even without the United Nations presentation, or if Secretary Powell had failed miserably in giving it. But the secretary's gravitas was a significant part of the two-year-long effort by the Bush administration to get Americans on the war wagon.

That effort led to a war of choice with Iraq -- one that resulted in catastrophic losses for the region and the United States-led coalition, and that destabilized the entire Middle East.

This should not be forgotten, since the Trump administration is using much the same playbook to create a false impression that war is the only way to address the threats posed by Iran.

Just over a month ago, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said that the administration had ""undeniable"" evidence that Iran was not complying with Security Council resolutions regarding its ballistic missile program and Yemen. Just like Mr. Powell, Ms. Haley showed satellite images and other physical evidence available only to the United States intelligence community to prove her case. But the evidence fell significantly short.

It's astonishing how similar that moment was to Mr. Powell's 2003 presentation on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction -- and how the Trump administration's methods overall match those of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. As I watched Ms. Haley at the Defense Intelligence Agency, I wanted to play the video of Mr. Powell on the wall behind her, so that Americans could recognize instantly how they were being driven down the same path as in 2003 -- ultimately to war. Only this war with Iran, a country of almost 80 million people whose vast strategic depth and difficult terrain make it a far greater challenge than Iraq, would be 10 to 15 times worse than the Iraq war in terms of casualties and costs.

If we want a slightly more official statement of the Trump administration's plans for Iran, we need only look at the recently released National Security Strategy, which says, ""The longer we ignore threats from countries determined to proliferate and develop weapons of mass destruction, the worse such threats become, and the fewer defensive options we have."" The Bush-Cheney team could not have said it better as it contemplated invading Iraq.

The strategy positions Iran as one of the greatest threats America faces, much the same way President Bush framed Saddam Hussein's Iraq. With China, Russia and North Korea all presenting vastly more formidable challenges to America and its allies than Iran, one has to wonder where the Trump team gets its ideas.

Though Ms. Haley's presentation missed the mark, and no one other than the national security elite will even read the strategy, it won't matter. We've seen this before: a campaign built on the politicization of intelligence and shortsighted policy decisions to make the case for war. And the American people have apparently become so accustomed to executive branch warmongering -- approved almost unanimously by the Congress -- that such actions are not significantly contested.

So far, news organizations have largely failed to refute false narratives coming out of the Trump White House on Iran. In early November, news outlets latched onto claims by unnamed American officials that newly released documents from Osama bin Laden's compound represented ""evidence of Iran's support of Al Qaeda's war with the United States.""

It's a vivid reminder of Vice President Cheney's desperate attempts in 2002-03 to conjure up evidence of Saddam Hussein's relationship with Al Qaeda from detainees at Guantánamo Bay. It harks back to the C.I.A. director George Tenet's assurances to Mr. Powell that the connection between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden was ironclad in the lead-up to his United Nations presentation. Today, we know how terribly wrong Mr. Tenet was.

Today, the analysts claiming close ties between Al Qaeda and Iran come from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which vehemently opposes the Iran nuclear deal and unabashedly calls for regime change in Iran.

It seems not to matter that 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11 were Saudis and none were Iranians. Or that, according to the United States intelligence community, of the groups listed as actively hostile to the United States, only one is loosely affiliated with Iran, and Hezbollah doesn't make the cut. More than ever the Foundation for Defense of Democracies seems like the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans that pushed falsehoods in support of waging war with Iraq.

The Trump administration's case for war with Iran ranges much wider than Ms. Haley's work. We should include the president's decertification ultimatum in January that Congress must ""fix"" the Iran nuclear deal, despite the reality of Iran's compliance; the White House's pressure on the intelligence community to cook up evidence of Iran's noncompliance; and the administration's choosing to view the recent protests in Iran as the beginning of regime change. Like the Bush administration before, these seemingly disconnected events serve to create a narrative in which war with Iran is the only viable policy.

As I look back at our lock-step march toward war with Iraq, I realize that it didn't seem to matter to us that we used shoddy or cherry-picked intelligence; that it was unrealistic to argue that the war would ""pay for itself,"" rather than cost trillions of dollars; that we might be hopelessly naïve in thinking that the war would lead to democracy instead of pushing the region into a downward spiral.

The sole purpose of our actions was to sell the American people on the case for war with Iraq. Polls show that we did. Mr. Trump and his team are trying to do it again. If we're not careful, they'll succeed.",6,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,74,115,2017,0.881514,0.826081061,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Hayden, Michael",2008,0,2018-04-28,,0,0,NYT,Air Force,,,M,The End of Intelligence,"When pressed on specifics, the president has routinely denigrated those who questioned him, whether the “fake” media, “so called” judges, Washington insiders or the “deep state.” He has also condemned Obama-era intelligence officials as “political hacks.”","In 1994 during the height of the Bosnian civil war, when I was head of intelligence for American forces in Europe, I walked through the ruined streets of Sarajevo. A city of once-beautiful steeples, onion-shaped domes and minarets had been devastated by Serbian artillery in the hills rising above the Miljacka River. I wondered what manner of man could pick up a sniper rifle and shoot former neighbors lining up for scarce water at a shuttered brewery.
What struck me most, though, was not how Sarajevans were different from us, but how much they weren’t. This had obviously been a cultured, tolerant, vibrant place that had been ripped asunder by the conflict pitting Muslim Bosniaks against Christian Serbs and Croats.
The veneer of civilization, I concluded, was quite thin — a natural thought for an intelligence officer whose profession trends pessimistic and whose work is consumed by threats and dangers. Over the years I had learned that the traditions and institutions that protect us from living Hobbesian “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” lives are inherently fragile and demand careful tending. In America today, they are under serious stress.
It was no accident that the Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year in 2016 was “post-truth,” a condition where facts are less influential in shaping opinion than emotion and personal belief. To adopt post-truth thinking is to depart from Enlightenment ideas, dominant in the West since the 17th century, that value experience and expertise, the centrality of fact, humility in the face of complexity, the need for study and a respect for ideas.
President Trump both reflects and exploits this kind of thinking. It is fair to say that the Trump campaign normalized lying to an unprecedented degree. There was the candidate’s claim that legions of Arabs celebrated wildly in New Jersey as the World Trade Center collapsed. He defended his calls for the intentional killing of the Sept. 11 terrorists’ families because “they knew what was happening” and had “watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center,” something for which there is zero evidence. He insinuated that Senator Ted Cruz’s father had a hand in John F. Kennedy’s assassination and that the Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia had been murdered.

When pressed on specifics, the president has routinely denigrated those who questioned him, whether the “fake” media, “so called” judges, Washington insiders or the “deep state.” He has also condemned Obama-era intelligence officials as “political hacks.”
David Priess, an intelligence officer who once gave presidential daily briefings, asked me whether I thought Mr. Trump could distinguish between truth and untruth. He raised the controversial speech Mr. Trump gave at a Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia in July 2017, a speech that was overly political and occasionally tasteless. In the face of sharp criticism, the president said that the Scouts’ leader had called him to say it was “the greatest speech that was ever made to them.”

Of course, no such call ever occurred. But was Mr. Trump actually able to draw a distinction between the past that had really happened and the past that he needed at that moment? Mr. Priess’s point was that you could sometimes convince a liar that he was wrong. What do you do with someone who does not distinguish between truth and untruth?

We in the intelligence world have dealt with obstinate and argumentative presidents through the years. But we have never served a president for whom ground truth really doesn’t matter.

For many Americans, this is not a problem. Last year, I met a few of them in the back room of a Pittsburgh sports bar where my brother had arranged for several dozen Trump supporters to meet with me.

I knew many of them, indeed had grown up with several. But we could have been from different planets. They were angry. They work hard, pay taxes and struggle to raise children, but feel neglected by their government. And Donald Trump is still their guy. “He is an American.” “He is genuine.” “He doesn’t filter everything or parse every word.”

They didn’t seem very interested in facts, either. Or at least not in my facts. Political partisanship in America has become what David Brooks calls “totalistic.” Partisan identity, as he writes, fills “the void left when their other attachments wither away — religious, ethnic, communal and familial.” Beliefs are now so tied to these identities that data is not particularly useful to argue a point.

Intelligence work — at least as practiced in the Western liberal tradition — reflects these threatened Enlightenment values: gathering, evaluating and analyzing information, and then disseminating conclusions for use, study or refutation.

How the erosion of Enlightenment values threatens good intelligence was obvious in the Trump administration’s ill-conceived and poorly carried out executive order that looked to the world like a Muslim ban.

That order was almost certainly not the product of intelligence analysis about the threat posed by immigrants from certain nations, but rather the president trying to fulfill a campaign promise based on exaggerated fears about immigrants and unfair criticism of the refugee vetting system. One former senior intelligence official told me that when the ban was announced internally, everyone was simply told to get on board.

I joined several other former directors and acting directors of the C.I.A., two former deputy directors, a former director of national intelligence and a former head of the National Counterterrorism Center and others in filing an amicus brief opposing the ban. The people now occupying our old positions were notably silent on the merits of the order.

Over time it has become clear to me that security decisions in the Trump administration follow a certain pattern. Discussion seems to start with a presidential statement or tweet. Then follows a large-scale effort to inform the president, to impress upon him the complexity of an issue, to review the relevant history, to surface more factors bearing on the problem, to raise second- and third-order consequences and to explore subsequent moves.

It’s not easy. The president by all accounts is not a patient man. According to The Washington Post, one Trump confidant called him “the two-minute man” with “patience for a half page.” He insists on five-page or shorter intelligence briefs, rather than the 60 pages we typically gave previous presidents. There is something inherently disturbing in that. There are some problems that cannot be simplified.

Sometimes, almost magically, he gets it right. The president’s speech last August on Afghanistan was worth listening to, clearly the product of the traditional deliberative process where intelligence sets the picture based on the best available information, and then security agencies weigh in with views that are adjudicated by the National Security Council.

But the Afghan experience has been the exception. The president continues to attack the Iranian nuclear deal and is likely to end it even in the face of intelligence that Iran has not committed a material breach of the compact, that the deal makes it more difficult for Iran to build a weapon and that it gives us visibility into its nuclear program.

Then there is Russia. The president only recently and grudgingly agreed to impose sanctions on Russians believed to have interfered in the American election, and he continues to characterize the investigation as a “witch hunt” while relentlessly attacking agencies of his own administration.

He humiliated the attorney general, undercut his national security adviser and engaged in personal vendettas against senior F.B.I. officials.

A few months after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, I got a call from a colleague who thought he might be on a very short list for a very senior position. He asked my opinion. I told him that three months earlier I would have talked to him about his duty to serve. Now I was telling him to say no. “You’re a young man,” I said. “Don’t put yourself at risk for the future. You have a lot to offer. Someday.”

When asked for counsel these days by officers who are already in government, especially more junior ones, I remind them of their duty to help the president succeed. But then I add: “Protect yourself. Take notes and save them. And above all, protect the institution. America still needs it.”

That creates a deeper dilemma. Intelligence becomes a feeble academic exercise if it is not relevant and useful. It always has to adapt to the idiosyncrasies, learning style, policies and priorities of any president to preserve its relevance and utility. But there have to be limits. History — and the next president — will judge American intelligence, and if it is found to have been too accommodating to this or any other president, it will be disastrous for the community.

These are truly uncharted waters for the country. We have in the past argued over the values to be applied to objective reality, or occasionally over what constituted objective reality, but never the existence or relevance of objective reality itself.

In this post-truth world, intelligence agencies are in the bunker with some unlikely mates: journalism, academia, the courts, law enforcement and science — all of which, like intelligence gathering, are evidence-based. Intelligence shares a broader duty with these other truth-tellers to preserve the commitment and ability of our society to base important decisions on our best judgment of what constitutes objective reality.

The historian Timothy Snyder stresses the importance of reality and truth in his cautionary pamphlet, “On Tyranny.” “To abandon facts,” he writes, “is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power because there is no basis upon which to do so.” He then chillingly observes, “Post-truth is pre-fascism.”

On a recent visit to the C.I.A., as I was standing near the iconic shield in the grand lobby, I was approached by a young officer who introduced himself and told me his story.
Born in Iraq, he became a translator for United States forces during the heavy fighting in Anbar Province. He later made his way to this country, declined an opportunity to attend an Ivy League college and volunteered for the Army. He became a crypto-linguist, working for the National Security Agency, helping fellow soldiers master the intricacies of Arabic. He then joined the C.I.A., where he was, with obvious enthusiasm, putting his skills to good use.

I was at the agency that day to attend the retirement ceremony of a Chinese-American officer who had aided me in my overseas travels, and I got to meet her immigrant parents.

Applying them to subsequent military endeavors might have alleviated or even eliminated the failures and frustrations that have become the principal themes of recent American military history.","""Twenty-five years ago this week, a Somali warlord named Mohammed Farah Aidid offered the American military a glimpse of its future. But neither policymakers back in Washington nor commanders in the field were attuned to what he had on offer.

A mission that had begun 10 months earlier to provide relief supplies to starving Somalis had evolved into a vastly more ambitious nation-building project. On the night of Oct. 3-4, 1993, an American military operation to capture Mr. Aidid ended in catastrophic failure, including 18 Americans dead. Soon afterward the entire mission collapsed, and the United States withdrew. Yet any lessons that might have been learned from this debacle stayed in Mogadishu, alongside the smoldering wreckage of the Black Hawk helicopter that Mr. Aidid’s fighters had shot down.

The United States did not go into Somalia expecting this kind of resistance. But Mr. Aidid took exception to the prospect of outsiders imposing a new political order on his country. From their sanctuaries in the crowded warrens of the Somali capital, his lightly armed but nimble militias ambushed and harassed American and coalition forces throughout the summer of 1993.

Casualties mounted. In response, President Bill Clinton ordered an elite commando task force to Mogadishu with the specific assignment of eliminating Mr. Aidid.

By most measures — training and discipline, firepower and mobility — Task Force Ranger had Mr. Aidid’s irregulars outclassed. His forces were technologically backward while the American troops had all the best gadgets that money could buy.

In the end, little of this mattered. Mr. Aidid himself proved both frustratingly elusive and far shrewder than the Americans expected. On six “snatch” attempts, the Rangers came up empty-handed. On the seventh, the enemy forces that the Americans disparaged as “skinnies” and “sammies” were waiting. In an instant, the hunters became the hunted.

In the ensuing firefight, subsequently enshrined in a best-selling book and a hit Hollywood movie , American troops inflicted many more casualties than they sustained. Yet ultimately it was the Americans who withdrew from the battlefield while Mr. Aidid’s forces stayed put. As for Mr. Aidid himself, he not only remained at large but as a result of his bloody encounter with crack American warriors, he saw his own status enhanced.

In contrast, back in the United States, the losses suffered by American troops proved politically unacceptable. Mr. Clinton conceded defeat and pulled out the entire American operation. Somalia remained in chaos.

We can choose to remember this event, coming during the grander era of American ideological triumph over the recently collapsed Soviet Union, as a minor embarrassment of little real consequence. Yet seeing the outcome for what it was — a sign of things to come — offers several useful lessons.

First, the contemporary battlefield is more likely to be urban and congested, rather than wide open and sparsely populated. Rarely will adversaries cooperate in fulfilling the American preference for long-range tank battles fought in the desert under skies dominated by American fighter-bombers and attack helicopters. The 2003 invasion of Iraq was an exception; the urban battles of the occupation that followed were closer to the rule.

Second, and by extension, the Pentagon’s investment in conventional warfare will continue to have little relevance in the sort of conflicts confronting American forces. The primary challenge is less to defeat armies than to control populations. Pacification rather than sustained close combat absorbs soldiers’ energy and attention. The greater part of the warrior’s role involves not killing but muting the antagonism caused by the warrior’s own unwelcome presence.

Third, if American forces find it difficult to adjust to the peculiar demands of such wars, then those responsible for formulating basic national security policy should consider the possibility that the wars themselves just might be futile.

Since 1993, the United States has killed any number of “skinnies” and “sammies,” not to mention innocent bystanders, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Syria and even back in Somalia, where drone strikes and Special Forces routinely target those who have succeeded Mr. Aidid in contesting the control of that country. Rarely does an American leader, political or military, explain what larger purpose these wars are serving. Never do they venture to speculate on when they might end.

Why was it necessary for the 18 Americans to die in a failed effort to dictate the future of Somalia? What purpose did their sacrifice serve? A quarter-century later, these questions have lost none of their pertinence. If anything, they have become more urgent.

In retrospect, the lessons to be taken from this small but immensely instructive episode appear obvious. In retrospect, lessons always do.

Yet with a bit more effort and perhaps a generous dose of humility, the United States might have discerned those lessons at the time. Applying them to subsequent military endeavors might have alleviated or even eliminated the failures and frustrations that have become the principal themes of recent American military history.

Instead, America’s leaders chose to ignore it — the sooner forgotten the better. This turned out to be a profound oversight, and the troops whom Americans profess to admire have since paid a high price for it.""",6,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,74,115,2017,0.881514,0.826081061,36.2713407,31.4835907

The soldiers would use force, if necessary, to prevent such an “invasion” of the United States.

Mr. Trump’s announcement and the deployment that followed (of roughly 5,900) were probably perfectly legal. But we are a bipartisan threesome with decades of experience in and with the Pentagon, and to us, this act creates a dangerous precedent. We fear this was lost in the public hand-wringing over the decision, so let us be clear: The president used America’s military forces not against any real threat but as toy soldiers, with the intent of manipulating a domestic midterm election outcome, an unprecedented use of the military by a sitting president.

The public debate focused on secondary issues. Is there truly a threat to American security from an unarmed group of tired refugees and asylum seekers on foot and a thousand miles from the border? Even the Army’s internal assessment did not find this a very credible threat.

Can the president deny in advance what could be legitimate claims for asylum, without scrutiny? Most likely, this violates treaty commitments the United States made as part of its agreement to refugee conventions in 1967, which it has followed for decades.

The deployment is not, in the context of the defense budget, an albatross. We are already paying the troops, wherever they’re deployed, and the actual incremental costs of sending them to the border might be $100 million to $200 million, a tiny fraction of the $716 billion defense budget.

Still, we can think of many ways to put the funds to better use, like improving readiness.

It’s also not unusual for a president to ask the troops to deploy to the border in support of border security operations. Presidents of both parties have sent troops to the border, to provide support functions like engineering, logistics, transportation and surveillance.

But those deployments have been generally in smaller numbers, usually the National Guard, and never to stop a caravan of refugees and asylum seekers.

So, generously, some aspects of the deployment are at least defensible. But one is not, and that aspect is the domestic political use — or rather, misuse — of the military.

James Mattis, the secretary of defense, asserted that the Defense Department does not “do stunts.” But this was a blatant political stunt. The president crossed a line — the military is supposed to stay out of domestic politics. As many senior military retirees have argued, the forces are not and should not be a political instrument. They are not toy soldiers to be moved around by political leaders but a neutral institution, politically speaking.

Oh, some might say, presidents use troops politically all the time. And so they do, generally in the context of foreign policy decisions that have political implications. Think Lyndon Johnson sending more troops to Vietnam, fearing he would be attacked for “cutting and running” from that conflict. Or George W. Bush crowing about “mission accomplished” when Saddam Hussein was toppled. Those are not the same thing as using troops at home for electoral advantage.

Electoral gain, not security, is this president’s goal. Two of us served in the military for many years; while all troops must obey the legal and ethical orders of civilian leaders, they need to have faith that those civilian leaders are using them for legitimate national security purposes. But the border deployment put the military right in the middle of the midterm elections, creating a nonexistent crisis to stimulate votes for one party.

When partisan actions like this occur, they violate civil-military traditions and erode that faith, with potentially long-term damage to the morale of the force and our democratic practice — all for electoral gain.

The deployment is a stunt, a dangerous one, and in our view, a misuse of the military that should have led Mr. Mattis to consider resigning, instead of acceding to this blatant politicization of America’s military.",6,Warfighting,,1,,,,The authors seem to know the President's intentions as they write this article and take a very strong stance on the issue.

"McChrystal, Stanley ",2010,1,2018-11-25,,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Good Riddance,"As President John F. Kennedy put it, ""The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie - deliberate, contrived and dishonest - but the myth - persistent, persuasive and unrealistic."" We must combat our desire to mythologize our history and our leaders, while retaining our belief in the qualities and ideals those myths often reflect","From my earliest days, Robert E. Lee felt close at hand. I attended Washington and Lee High School in Arlington,
Va., and began my soldier's life at Lee's alma mater, the U.S. Military Academy. Today, if Lee still lived in his
childhood home in Alexandria, Va., we would be neighbors. So it felt appropriate, when I was a young Army
lieutenant, that my wife bought me an inexpensive painting of the famed Southern warrior. And from the wall of
the many quarters we occupied over 34 years, Lee's portrait was literally watching over me. Through the lens of
military history and our seemingly parallel lives, he was my hero - brilliant, valiant and loyal.
As early as his days at West Point, Lee stood out. His classmates nicknamed the studious, near-perfect cadet the
""Marble Man."" But over time, even marble's flaws become more visible.
In the summer of 2017, my wife, Annie, urged me to take down the picture. Disgusted by the images of hate and
white supremacy that had descended on Charlottesville in the form of angry, torch-bearing men, she felt that
Lee's picture risked offending guests to our home by sending an unintended message of agreement with the
protesters who had sought to preserve a statue of the Marble Man. Initially, I argued that Lee was an example of
apolitical loyalty and stoic adherence to duty. But as days passed, I reflected on the way that Lee's legacy looked
to people who hadn't grown up with my perspective or my privilege. So, on an otherwise unremarkable Sunday
morning, I took the painting off the wall and sent it on its way to a local landfill for its final burial. Hardly a hero's
end.
Why did it take me so long to reconsider my thinking on the Marble Man? While I've spent my life studying leaders
and leadership, abandoning long-held beliefs, some based on comfortable myths, requires a journey that I
suspect never ends. Our heroes, in addition to their strengths, almost always harbor profound imperfections. I still
admire much about Lee, his integrity included. But to see him as I long had, through a single lens, was to
fundamentally misunderstand the kaleidoscopic nature of leaders - and, more broadly, the nature of our past. No
matter how much we study or how long we've lived, the hardest work we can do is to rotate the kaleidoscope, to
see the world in a new light and to evolve our beliefs accordingly.
Such evolution takes time. And for all the years it takes individuals to grapple with their own perspectives, it takes
even longer for organizations to follow suit. Institutions are conservative and slow to change, and the military is no
exception. Steeped as they are in tradition and admired for consistency, it is difficult for the U.S. armed forces to
develop new outlooks on warfare, social issues and, notably, their own view of history.
The way I learned about Lee exemplifies the challenge that service members can face in confronting their biases.
For most of my life, I focused on the genius and triumphs of the Marble Man. This was not surprising. No matter
where I was living, there seemed to be a statue celebrating Lee's accomplishments. My elementary school
textbooks heralded Lee's successes on the battlefield. At West Point, he is commonly referred to as the ideal
cadet - not just for his lack of demerits, but for his closely held values and his academic achievements. But
although the history was well-known, I cannot recall ever debating Lee's decision to command the Confederate
Army against his nation, nor any serious discussion about his attitude toward slavery.
The military prides itself on being apolitical and focused on the moral good. Yet these tenets have also served as
an excuse to avoid conversations about contentious or uncomfortable topics, such as race, politics and sexuality.
Yes, those are inherently political issues, but military leaders cannot afford to pretend they don't exist, as the
American military is necessarily, and appropriately, a reflection of American society.

The U.S. military plays a major role in shaping our collective memory. In the years after the Civil War and the
subsequent Reconstruction, for instance, there was a tacit agreement in the Army (as in much of society) that we
wouldn't treat the South as if it had lost - which is one reason so many Army bases (including Forts Bragg,
Benning, Polk, Hood and Lee) are named after Confederate generals. It would be foolish to think that the Army
made these decisions unintentionally. Many officers knew full well the signal that these names would send.
Whether you revere or revile Confederate soldiers, it's impossible not to see that their legacy is still with us.
Many Americans face the same problem: We want to be proud of our past, so it's tempting to look at only the best
aspects of it. It's more comforting to think of Lee as a tragic hero than to try to understand his complex
relationship with African Americans today - so we focus on the simpler narrative. Similarly, we perceive the
aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, as a time of unity in the wake of tragedy, ignoring the virulent anti-Muslim fervor that
still affects parts of our country. In an effort to remember only the finest of our past, we often present our history
as tidier than its reality.
War is often subjected to this tendency to clean up, or at least oversimplify. It is hard to discuss the periodic
incompetence, cowardice and criminality that are associated with every military campaign in history without
seeming to detract from the very real courage and sacrifice of the vast majority of soldiers. And nothing is more
difficult than portraying war in its gritty, brutal reality, or the darker side of soldiers, without the risk of confusing
Americans about whether our cause is just or our nation a force for good in the world. As Pericles and others
have taught us, we must honor the kinds of service that we seek to have repeated in the future. We must salute
and remember the veterans who stepped forward to serve while admitting the complexity of the environment in
which they had to operate.
This is the week when we sit down with our families to celebrate our nation's romanticized notion of Thanksgiving
- a version, we know today, that does not reflect the reality of the first celebration of this holiday, in which the
bonhomie was a small consolation to indigenous Americans enduring a colonial English conquest.
When we choose how we view history, we risk mythologizing events and people, reducing them to
two-dimensional stories. It takes nothing away from Abraham Lincoln's heroic stewardship of our nation through
the Civil War, for instance, to admit that he was still a creature of his era. For most of his career, he saw slaves as
rival laborers for white wage-workers and thought they should go back to Africa. Frustratingly, our instinct to
sanitize history ensures that we are always looking backward for our better angels, struggling to meet a standard
that remains forever out of reach.
There is, in the end, little point in studying a version of history that contains cartoons and monuments rather than
real people with nuanced actions and decisions - people whose complexities can teach us about our own. As we
come to learn more about our world and ourselves, it is crucial to reexamine our role models and our enemies.
There is tremendous value in wrestling with the errors over which history commonly glosses. Coming to terms
with the humanity of a leader makes it much more likely that you can be a leader yourself. We are facing a crisis
in leadership today - and organizations and individuals both have a role to play in correcting course.
Organizations are often at their finest when they are used as instruments for social change, especially when that
change is necessary for the greater good. President Harry S. Truman's executive order desegregating the military
is a magnificent example of how leaders can help speed up institutional change. We are a long way from solving
racism in our country, but Truman's decision was an important step in changing the hearts and minds of our
soldiers, their families and society writ large. The same logic can be extended to the inclusion of women in
combat and the open service of LGBTQ troops. It's for these reasons that the military must recast its view of
history: The actions of our military leaders have a profound effect on the American psyche - but they cannot make
this change alone.

Now They're Warning Us About Trump,"During the war in Iraq, when the retired generals assailed Rumsfeld's leadership, they were saying in public what their friends still in uniform were saying in private. Then, the generals were worried about saving democracy in Iraq; today, the former military leaders speaking out are worried about something far more important: preserving the liberal world order. I would not be surprised if they have acted on behalf of their serving peers in an effort to save American lives and honor. I know for an absolute certainty that when these four-stars speak, we should be paying attention.","In 2006, the war in Iraq was moving in a bad direction, with hundreds of Iraqis and dozens of American soldiers being killed weekly. As violence escalated and defeat seemed imminent, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld stubbornly clung to a strategy of withdrawing U.S. troops. When the hour was darkest, an unlikely set of heroes emerged.

Retired generals — Paul Eaton (Army) and Gregory Newbold and Anthony Zinni (Marine Corps) — began to speak publicly against Rumsfeld's leadership of the war in Iraq. The ""

Revolt of the Generals,"" as Time termed the criticism, was a rarity in U.S. history; it may well have contributed to the Republicans' losing control of both the House and the Senate in the 2006 midterm elections. After what he described as an electoral ""

thumping,"" President George W. Bush fired Rumsfeld and replaced him with Robert M. Gates, who implemented the president's troop surge into Iraq — a complete reversal of his predecessor's policy. With a new commander, Gen. David H. Petraeus, in charge, violence in Iraq dropped by two-thirds over the next 18 months.

The retired generals who spoke out likely helped change the course of a war, saving thousands of lives, giving Iraq a chance at freedom and preventing it from becoming a terrorist haven.

Today, there are increasing signs that the nation's security is again in great peril, and retired military leaders — all of them with four-star distinction — are again sounding the alarm. This time it is not the defense secretary whose policies and inclinations are perceived as the problem, but his boss: the commander in chief.

These military leaders' expressions of dismay and alarm have been uncoordinated but earnest. The first came from retired Adm. William H. McRaven, the Navy SEAL who commanded the 2011 mission that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. In August 2018, McRaven wrote a Post op-ed in the form of a

•etter to President Trump, saying, ""Through your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.""

In late December, Stanley A. McChrystal, retired Army general and former commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, said during an ABC News

interview that the president was both immoral and less than honest. Also at the end of December, retired Marine Corps Gen. John F. Kelly, who had served as the president's chief of staff for 17 months, told the

Los Angeles Times

he was proudest during his White House tenure of the things that he prevented Trump from doing. Retired

admiral and former NATO commander James G. Stavridis

wrote for Time on Jan. 3 of a ""sense that the President's moral structure was, shall we say charitably, unconventional to the military mind.""

Much of this commentary followed the Dec. 20 resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general. Mattis's accomplishments leading the Pentagon included persuading Trump

not to withdraw the United States from the NATO alliance. (Breaking up NATO has been a dream of Russia, and before that, the Soviet Union.) In his

resignation letter, Mattis suggested that the president was harming U.S. alliances that have kept the United States and the world safe. Although Trump apparently at first did not understand the implications of Mattis's letter, he soon seemed to grasp the criticism and ordered Mattis to leave before his replacement had been found. The country was thus deprived of a farewell ceremony that might have given Mattis an opportunity to sound an even clearer warning about the threats to the nation, without once mentioning the president by name.

But Mattis's resignation letter, and his resignation itself, spoke volumes. The letter dovetails with the public statements by the remarkable array of American military leaders cited above, men who devoted their careers and risked their lives in the nation's defense. They are not afraid of much, but they are deeply concerned by what they see and know about the president.

During the war in Iraq, when the retired generals assailed Rumsfeld's leadership, they were saying in public what their friends still in uniform were saying in private. Then, the generals were worried about saving democracy in Iraq; today, the former military leaders speaking out are worried about something far more important: preserving the liberal world order.

But the immediate national security crisis is a White House browbeating our scientific and intelligence community into its political line or seeking to tamper with the science and intelligence itself.,"The president is trying to subvert the science that informs the intelligence community.

Once again, the Trump White House is publicly crossing swords with the intelligence community in ways that are likely to harm American security.

The latest salvo is an effort taking shape over the next few weeks to “red team” the science of climate change — in effect, to challenge it and investigate it for uncertainties. The backdrop for the scheme is President Trump publicly questioning the accuracy of the nation’s most extensive and scientifically robust assessment by 13 federal agencies that showed how stronger storms, higher sea levels, more heat waves and sundry other effects of climate change will harm the nation. This same science has also informed a new intelligence community report that identifies climate change as a significant threat to national security.

Impacts typical of a changing climate are already buffeting the front lines of America’s military presence. Some are palpable and easily trace back to warming. For example, in Alaska, erosion from warmer weather is undermining the foundations at some radar facilities that are critical early-warning networks for attacks on the United States. They are among dozens of facilities the Pentagon has tagged as at risk from recurrent flooding, drought, desertification, wildfires or thawing permafrost resulting from shifts in climate that are happening much faster than expected. To some degree, better engineering — although often at substantially higher cost — will help reduce these impacts.

Much more insidious are the effects of warming on the social fabric and confidence in government in countries whose stability matters to American security. As commander of United States forces in Afghanistan and other locations, one of us (General Allen) dealt regularly with insurgencies and failed states that created direct dangers to American security. In Afghanistan, for example, the failure of the state is linked in part to weaker agriculture (the main source of income in most communities).

What makes climate change such a pernicious problem is that it increases the odds of those adverse conditions arising — especially in places where government already does not function well. When the stress of climate change multiplies, so will the problems the military must handle.

While it’s always a good idea to look at uncertainties in any scientific assessment, the White House red-teaming is poised to investigate the wrong questions. The scheme, anchored in the climate-denier community, is designed to generate talking points for a president who is skeptical of climate science and thus will focus on whether climate change is happening at all and whether a little warming is all bad news.

A useful red team would investigate uncertainties in the opposite way, by focusing on the evidence that the climate is changing much more rapidly than originally expected. Getting serious about the odds that global warming could be much more harmful than expected could amplify previous assessments for the nation’s security.

Uncertainty is endemic to climate science because the exact level of future changes in climate are hard to pin down. The pathways that lead from warming to tangible harm to the nation’s coastlines, crops, military and overseas interests are highly complex. Some of the best scientific studies on these impacts — including last fall’s assessment by 13 federal agencies — have begun to look at how uncertainty and complexity interact in ways that make climate dangers look much scarier. Good intelligence estimates must grapple more fully with this as well, but doing that properly will be a lot harder now that the White House is instructing the rest of the government to avoid serious analysis of climate dangers.

This week, 58 former military and intelligence officials sent a letter to the president warning him that “imposing a political test on reports issued by the science agencies, and forcing a blind spot onto the national security assessments that depend on them, will erode our national security.”

This is hardly the only place where the Trump White House is visibly undermining its own intelligence community. Recent examples abound — North Korea, Russia and Iran, among many other locations — of the White House taking issue with its own appointed intelligence officials on vital national security issues. With that as precedent, the White House warning shot across the intelligence agencies on climate change is hardly surprising yet still alarming.

Ignoring the anti-science noise in the White House is dangerous for the nation. Climate change is arguably America’s and its allies’ longest-term security crisis.

"Petraeus, David and Whitehouse, Sheldon",2011,1,2019-03-11,,0,0,WaPO,Army,,1,M,Authoritarians' Corruption is a Weapon - and a Weakness,"In particular, the United States should make it more difficult for kleptocrats, and their agents, to secretly move money through the rule-of-law world, whether by opening bank accounts, transferring funds or hiding assets behind shell corporations. Failure to close loopholes in these areas is an invitation to foreign interference in America's democracy and a threat to national sovereignty.","Thirty years after the end of the Cold War, the world is once again polarized between two competing visions for how to organize society. On one side are countries such as the United States, which are founded on respect for the inviolable rights of the individual and governed by rule of law. On the other side are countries where state power is concentrated in the hands of a single person or clique, accountable only to itself and oiled by corruption.

Alarmingly, while Washington has grown ambivalent in recent years about the extent to which America should encourage the spread of democracy and human rights abroad, authoritarian regimes have become increasingly aggressive and creative in attempting to export their own values against the United States and its allies. Russian President Vladimir Putin and other authoritarian rulers have worked assiduously to weaponize corruption as an instrument of foreign policy, using money in opaque and illicit ways to gain influence over other countries, subvert the rule of law and otherwise remake foreign governments in their own kleptocratic image.

In this respect, the fight against corruption is more than a legal and moral issue; it has become a strategic one — and a battleground in a great power competition.

Yet corruption is not only one of the most potent weapons wielded by America's authoritarian rivals, it is also, in many cases, what sustains these regimes in power and is their Achilles' heel.

For figures such as Putin, the existence of America's rule-of-law world is intrinsically threatening. Having enriched themselves on a staggering scale — exploiting positions of public trust for personal gain — they live in fear that the full extent of their thievery could be publicly exposed, and that the U.S. example might inspire their people to demand better.

Corrupt regimes also know that, even as they strive to undermine the rule of law around the world, they are simultaneously dependent on it to a remarkable degree. In contrast to the Cold War, when the Soviet bloc was sealed off from the global economy and sustained by its faith in communist ideology, today's autocrats and their cronies cynically seek to spend and shelter their spoils in democratic nations, where they want to shop, buy real estate, get health care and send their children to school.

Ironically, one of the reasons 21st-century kleptocrats are so fixated on transferring their wealth to the United States and similar countries is because of the protections afforded by the rule of law. Having accumulated their fortunes illegally, they are cognizant that someone more connected to power could come along and rob them too, as long as their loot is stuck at home.

Fortunately, the United States has begun to take steps to harden its rule-of-law defenses and push back against foreign adversaries. The passage of the Global Magnitsky Act in 2016, for instance, provided a powerful new tool for targeting corruption worldwide that is being increasingly utilized. But there is more to do.

In particular, the United States should make it more difficult for kleptocrats, and their agents, to secretly move money through the rule-of-law world, whether by opening bank accounts, transferring funds or hiding assets behind shell corporations. Failure to close loopholes in these areas is an invitation to foreign interference in America's democracy and a threat to national sovereignty.

Congress should tighten campaign-finance laws to improve transparency given that U.S. elections are clearly being targeted for manipulation by great-power competitors.

At the same time, the United States must become more aggressive and focused on identifying and rooting out corruption overseas. Just as the Treasury Department has developed sophisticated financial-intelligence capabilities in response to the threat of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, it is time to expand this effort to track, disrupt and expose the corrupt activities of authoritarian competitors and those aligned with them.

Hardening the nation's rule-of-law defenses is not, of course, a substitute for traditional forms of U.S. power, including military strength and economic dynamism. But it can provide an additional set of tools to bolster national security.

In the intensifying worldwide struggle between the rule of law and corruption, the United States cannot afford neutrality. Complacency about graft and kleptocracy beyond U.S. borders risks complicity in it — with grave consequences both for the nation's reputation abroad and Americans' well-being at home.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,73,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

This decision hurts our national security, deprives our ranks of much-needed talent and flies in the face of the values our military institution represents.","The Defense Department announced plans last week to reinstate a ban on service by openly transgender
Americans that, until now, has been blocked by multiple court rulings. This decision hurts our national security,
deprives our ranks of much-needed talent and flies in the face of the values our military institution represents.
I should know. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2007 to 2011, I advocated - and led our armed forces
through - the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" a policy that similarly forbade gay and lesbian troops from serving
openly.
We managed this transition carefully, not only with an eye toward data but also with a strong sense of how the
policy might affect morale and mission accomplishment. A panel of military and civilian investigators conducted a
comprehensive review of the facts on the ground, which found that there was no good rationale for the ban and
that eliminating it posed a negligible risk to military effectiveness . We were willing to release the findings of that
work and to defend it publicly.
I was troubled that our military had a policy forcing service members to lie about who they were as a condition of
service. This, I felt, was a blow to their integrity, as well as to our military's. If there were no cost for equal
treatment and a high cost - in talent, careers and integrity - for discrimination, ending the ban was a simple
choice. Subsequent research shows our military was stronger for it.
In 2015, a similar process took place around transgender service. The Pentagon created a working group
consisting of military and civilian personnel representing all the services and the Joint Staff, and it also engaged
the Rand Corp. to conduct an exhaustive study into the readiness implications of open service. The process
confirmed what prior research and experience had told us : There is no valid medical or military rationale for
banning openly transgender Americans from serving as their true selves, or from obtaining medically necessary
health care. The department lifted its ban against transgender personnel in 2016.
The military's experience with open transgender service over the past three years has only corroborated that
conclusion. Despite concerns about financial costs, the price tag of providing care for transgender troops has
been negligible , amounting to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the military's annual health-care budget.
Despite worries about transgender service in austere environments, Pentagon data shows that nearly 400 people
with gender dysphoria have successfully deployed to combat zones.
Several of these service members gave poignant testimony before Congress last month, displaying the kind of
talent and bravery our military needs. Alivia Stehlik, for instance, a transgender U.S. Military Academy graduate,
deployed to Afghanistan as a physical therapist, where she treated more than 1,700 patients. She told lawmakers
that being honest about herself inspired fellow service members to be more honest about themselves. Her
integrity bred more integrity, and instead of spiraling into denial and pretense, her unit enjoyed enhanced
cohesion and morale.
Stehlik is one of a small cohort who will be grandfathered in under the new ban. But whatever rationale retains
her for service ought to welcome any qualified transgender person. The new policy, which is based on the
recommendations of a panel that then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis commissioned, bars another Stehlik from
joining the military. At a time when the military is missing its recruiting goals and spending hundreds of millions of
Page 25 of 168 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
dollars on enlistment bonuses and lowering standards to fill shortfalls, we should think twice about banning
service by qualified transgender people for reasons that have nothing to do with ability.
Like ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the current ban presents itself as a neutral policy imposing narrow restrictions on a
segment of the LGBT population instead of what it is: a cudgel broadly targeting a defining characteristic of the
population. The new policy allows transgender people to serve only if they avoid being diagnosed with gender
dysphoria and agree to serve in their birth gender.
The Pentagon is being too cute by half when it claims it is not banning transgender people from service. A policy
that targets proxies of being transgender amounts to an effective ban. Worse, it could discourage people from
seeking the psychological and medical help they may need, potentially leading - as the Rand Corp. study found -
to more cases of substance abuse and suicide.
In war, it's crucial to fight the next battle instead of the last. Likewise, we should be aiming to build the military of
the future, not of the past. Discriminating against a group of proven patriots is no way to appeal to the next
generation of fighters and serves only to place politics above readiness. Fortunately, the Pentagon has stated it is
committed to reviewing the data on transgender service within two years. We must hope that, when it does, it is
prepared to do so with a genuinely open mind and to do the right thing.",10,SocialPolicy,,,,,,,73,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

If Iran wants peaceful nuclear power, fine. But under this plan, the regime would not have the ability to enrich, reprocess or fabricate its own nuclear fuel.","The Iranian regime recently announced its decision to produce fissile material with a purity of more than 4.5%.
Iran's nuclear program is again on the march. In truth, it never stopped -- contrary to glowing media reports and
efforts by some Western leaders to spin on what the regime was doing.
Under the Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Iranians could ramp up quickly and
easily from the enrichment levels necessary for peaceful nuclear power to levels needed to make a bomb. The
10-year sunset clause allowed Iran to go back to enriching uranium at any level.
The agreement also didn't restrict Iran's ballistic-missile program, which gives it a way to launch a nuclear bomb.
All this, combined with an incredibly weak inspection regime and the deal's complete silence on Tehran's
sponsorship of terrorism, made the JCPOA, as President Trump rightly put it last year, a ""one-sided deal that
should have never, ever been made."" We supported his decision to withdraw from it.
Yet with or without the JCPOA, the U.S. still has to deal with Iran's ambition to acquire a nuclear weapon. If it
succeeds, Arab states will try to acquire their own. Nuclear proliferation across the Middle East would be a
nightmare scenario for the world.
But before we reach the point at which military conflict is inevitable, we hope the Trump administration will
consider a simple, clear proposal. Iran could be allowed -- in concert with their Arab neighbors -- to operate
reactors and produce nuclear power. If Iran wants peaceful nuclear power, fine. But under this plan, the regime
would not have the ability to enrich, reprocess or fabricate its own nuclear fuel.
Since the Iranians don't trust the U.S., other countries -- Russia, China, European states -- could supply the fuel
rods for producing peaceful nuclear energy. The U.S. could begin supplying fuel rods for nuclear reactors
throughout the Arab world. Dozens of nations already operate under similar nuclear frameworks.
Under this proposal, Iran could become a legitimate nuclear-power nation with all the benefits of following
international rules. But under no circumstances would it be permitted to enrich nuclear material for the purpose of
building a weapon. If the Iranians rejected this proposal, that would tell the world everything it needed to know
about its intentions.
If Iran agreed, however, the U.S. would accomplish the twin goals of averting war and denying the ayatollahs the
chance to build a nuclear weapon. But U.S. negotiators must face the probability that the Iranians don't want a
peaceful nuclear program. Time and again they have misled inspectors, lied to international observers and
pressed ahead with their nuclear and missile-delivery programs.
Any new agreement with Iran must also do what the JCPOA didn't even attempt: require that Iran stop its support
for terrorism and efforts to destabilize its regional neighbors.
We applaud Mr. Trump and his tough stance against the Iranian regime. We also applaud his thoughtful and
measured response to numerous Iranian provocations. But it's time to put a choice to the Iranians. We urge our
European partners to work with the U.S. administration to fashion a realistic proposal that lays the groundwork for
a future of stability and peace between Iran and the world. Let's if the Iranians want what they claim to want: a
peaceful solution.",10,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,73,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

That the position was vacant for more than six months – and that this lack of leadership has become systemic – is shocking. This chaotic security situation emboldens U.S. adversaries, alarms allies and erodes the Defense Department’s ability to retain the talented careerists needed for the military’s long-term health.","The global threats that the U.S. military
faces are the least of its concerns.
Sure, the actions recently attributed to Iran - damaging two tankers in the Gulf of Oman and shooting down a
drone - have further inflamed an already tense situation in the Middle East. But Iran shouldn't keep us up at night.
Nor should North Korea's threats to resume testing ballistic missiles. Or China's ongoing attempt to militarize the
South China Sea, slowly shifting the Indo-Pacific's balance of power. Even Russian attempts to ignite a
hypersonic arms race worry me less than what is going on inside the Pentagon.
The Pentagon is in far greater trouble because of one simple reason: a lack of leadership.
The Pentagon recently surpassed a previously-unthought-of milestone - 6 1 / 2 months without a
Senate-confirmed secretary at the helm. Mark Esper, the president's new nominee for the position, was the
second person to serve as acting defense secretary. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 ensured that a
third acting secretary - Richard V. Spencer, the secretary of the Navy - temporarily took the helm Monday, as
Esper cannot serve as acting secretary while under consideration for the permanent appointment.
The Senate rightly fast-tracked Esper's nomination, holding the hearing before its Armed Services Committee on
Tuesday, and his strong performance seemed to assure his confirmation, with a floor vote anticipated on
Thursday.
Even still, this long-standing leadership vacuum is compounded by a Pentagon with an acting deputy defense
secretary, acting secretary of the Army, acting secretary of the Air Force, acting inspector general, acting
assistant defense secretary for international security affairs . . . the list goes on. CNN revealed earlier this month
that 19 of the most senior Pentagon positions are either vacant or filled by a temporary acting official. Lower-tier
leadership posts are similarly gapped. Friends serving in the Pentagon describe a disordered situation, where no
one can speak with confidence regarding the military's long-term priorities.
This situation is untenable. It took a turn for the worse when Adm. William Moran, the Senate-confirmed chief of
naval operations, resigned last week before ever taking office. Adm. John Richardson will remain the Navy's top
officer before reaching mandatory retirement in September. The race is now on to identify, vet and nominate a
replacement before time runs out.
Then, on July 10, Gen. John Hyten's nomination as the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - the
second-most-senior uniformed officer in the United States - was placed at risk by allegations of misconduct.
Although military officials deemed the allegations insufficient to bring charges, he could become a politically
unpalatable choice for the job. Gen. Paul J. Selva, who holds the job, retires at the end of this month.

Under any normal circumstances, even a week without a defense secretary could present a dangerous leadership
vacuum in the Pentagon. That the position was vacant for more than six months - and that this lack of leadership
has become systemic - is shocking. This chaotic security situation emboldens U.S. adversaries, alarms allies and
erodes the Defense Department's ability to retain the talented careerists needed for the military's long-term
health.
It also delays the transformative change the military sorely needs.
The 2018 National Defense Strategy acknowledged that the U.S. military is ""emerging from a period of strategic
atrophy, aware that our military advantage has been eroding."" The strategy cited as reasons an increasingly
complex security environment, rapid technological change and the impact to readiness from 18 consecutive years
of war, requiring that we prioritize ""what is most important to field a lethal, resilient, and rapidly adapting Joint
Force.""
But how does one prioritize without a leader? How can the Pentagon ""gain full value from every taxpayer dollar""
or ""deliver performance at the speed of relevance"" without Senate- confirmed senior leadership?
One benefit of a vast bureaucracy is inertia - the ability to weather short periods of change, such as administration
swap-outs following a presidential election. But inertia can carry you only so far. The reality is that a ship without a
captain can remain afloat, but the ship's effectiveness degrades rapidly without a leader.
The U.S. military - and the United States itself - must have a real defense secretary. If voted through, Esper and
the administration must prioritize putting Senate-confirmed leaders in place at the Pentagon. The military needs
leaders empowered to speak from a position of strength, with Congress's vote of confidence behind them.
Only a real - not acting - defense secretary can enact the strategic changes needed to restore the military and
steer the Pentagon from away from its rudderless course. While our uniformed military leaders are well-equipped
to respond to conflicts overseas, only senior civilian leaders can provide the overarching policy guidance they
require.
President Trump declared during his Fourth of July address that ""our nation is stronger today than it ever was
before."" Unfortunately, his statement does not reflect ground truth at the Pentagon, where actions - or a lack
thereof - speak louder than words ever could. The world won't wait for senior leaders to be nominated and
confirmed. Today's flash points are already here, and more are likely on the way.",5,CivMilBalance,,,,,,,73,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards."" We don't know the
basis for such awards. But whether they were granted for the officers' roles in Gallagher's recent court-martial or
not, the president's punitive ire risks causing dangerous reverberating effects.
This is not the first time Trump has waded into the waters of military justice. Of course, as commander in chief,
the president is vested with a legitimate responsibility related to the order and discipline of the armed forces. But
while this latest commentary may not have crossed a legal line, it demonstrates, again, the president's
unfortunate and dangerous misunderstanding of the military justice system — a system specifically developed to
ensure good order and discipline. Even worse, his commentary could be viewed as an effort to improperly
manipulate the process of military justice. Ultimately, the potential damage to the integrity of this unique system of
justice is profound.
The president's ire seems to be based, in part, on his assumption that military prosecutors acted improperly. But if
they did act unethically, either their supervisors or the military judge presiding over the trial would have initiated
an ethics inquiry. The fact that no such action has been taken indicates the president is simply misinformed.
Worse yet, it demonstrates an unjustified lack of confidence in the integrity of the prosecutors the president
attacked and the military legal system itself.
How will military lawyers and the commanders they advise respond to future allegations of war crimes, knowing
they may be excoriated, or worse, by the commander in chief? Will the president's criticism of the decision to
prosecute Gallagher — a decision based on credible evidence and made not by prosecutors but by a senior and
highly experienced military commander — adversely influence future assessments of similar cases? These are
difficult questions to answer. Whatever the answer, Trump's public diatribe threatens the credibility of a system of
justice that has helped maintain order and discipline in our armed forces for centuries. Worse yet, it chips away at
public trust in the integrity of this system.
With less than 2 percent of Americans serving in the armed forces and only a tiny minority of them ever involved
in military criminal cases, public confidence in our military justice system largely depends on what comes through
in the media. And the president seems as perplexed as anyone about which cases are brought to trial and why.
The resulting distortions may only make it harder to hold service members accountable for wartime misconduct.
Gallagher's case demonstrates how difficult it has become to ensure public accountability for alleged war crimes.
His supporters, including the president, were vocal critics of the decision to bring the allegation of murder to trial
by court-martial. These critics — and those who question other prosecutions — ignore the fact that cases such as
Gallagher's end up in a military courtroom precisely because of credible evidence indicating violations of the most
basic rules of war — rules that American forces are expected to, and almost always do, respect.
These would-be defenders of service members also fail to grasp a basic truth that senior military commanders
recognize — the danger of ignoring such violations. Inevitably, the impulse to overlook alleged war crimes derives
from the mistaken idea that volunteering for military service somehow immunizes service members from
disciplinary consequences of their criminal misconduct. Such a fallacy belies the reality that adhering to these
laws ensures disciplined forces, operational success and moral clarity.

Army Lt. Clint Lorance's court-martial, conviction and subsequent call for presidential pardon provides another
example of the danger of distorted public narratives. After he was convicted of murder based on his orders to his
soldiers to fire upon men on a motorcycle and on his attempts to conceal the crime, a campaign to secure his
pardon painted him as the victim of a rush to judgment. But Lorance's case went to trial only after his
commanding general reviewed all the available information and concluded that his conduct fell outside the scope
of the violence justified by a situation of combat. His case was then presented to a jury of military officers — jurors
with an innate understanding of what it means to be in combat.
That trial afforded him all the rights any criminal defendant would have in a civilian court, and his conviction
required his military jury to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt. The military officers who judged
Lorance were not naive about the confusing and challenging conditions of battle; they appreciated better than
most that the proverbial fog of war often results in tragic but understandable mistakes. Ultimately, they convicted
him based on the strength of the evidence, despite their appreciation of the complexities of war.
Like those who demanded charges against Gallagher be dismissed without a trial, the people who called upon the
president to pardon Lorance no doubt believe it was somehow unfair to subject him to criminal accountability for
his crimes. But in all such cases, even acquittal on the most serious charges is not an indication that the military
justice system failed. Instead, it reaffirms that system's fairness and ability to ensure that a conviction or acquittal
must be based on admissible evidence and not speculation.
Accountability for battlefield misconduct is an essential component of command responsibility, one shouldered by
our military commanders and the president. It includes the duty to ensure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and
Marines face the challenges of war with honor. It also means that the officers entrusted with leadership must
ensure that transgressors are held accountable using the well-developed processes established for that purpose
— and that when the evidence supports sending a case to trial by court-martial, military prosecutors zealously
prosecute the case in accordance with law and ethics. When they do so, an acquittal does not justify approbation,
especially from the commander in chief. Unfortunately, the president missed the true message of this case — that
the system worked and justice was served. This should be viewed as a source of pride by the president and the
American public, not cause for condemnation.",5,ServiceCulture,,,,,,,73,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Brown, Heidi",2017,1,2019-08-08,,0,0,WSJ,Army,,,F,The Truth About General John Hyten,"For the good of the country, for the good of actual sexual assault survivors, and for the good of due process and other values we hold dear, the Senate should confirm Gen. Hyten as vice chairman.","Air Force Gen. John Hyten is commander of U.S. Strategic Command and President Trump's nominee to be vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Last week the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 20-7 to send his nomination to the floor -- but not before it was clouded by allegations of sexual misconduct from a female subordinate.

Army Col. Kathryn Spletstoser's accusations are graphic and nauseating. But they are discredited by evidence. I have reviewed the written record of the case, including a redacted report from the Army Inspector General Office, and spoken with people involved. I served at Stratcom headquarters in Omaha, Neb., with both Gen. Hyten and Col. Spletstoser, including at the time of one of the claimed assaults. While she confided in me over various issues, she never brought up an assault by Gen. Hyten.

In late 2017, Col. Spletstoser was accused of what the Army calls ""toxic leadership"" -- intimidating, abusive and threatening behavior toward subordinates. In January 2018, Gen. Hyten approved an Army 15-6 investigation, which corroborated the charges. Col. Spletstoser was relieved of her position on Feb. 26, 2018.

Later that day, Omaha police were summoned to her home address. Their report states that ""after a disturbance at the office,"" Col. Spletstoser threatened that Gen. Hyten ""[had] 24 hours to rectify the situation, or [she] was going to kill [herself]"" (bracketed text in original). Officers took her to a clinic.

Beginning in June 2018, Col. Spletstoser launched a dizzying avalanche of charges against her superiors, including Gen. Hyten, his chief of staff, and officers who investigated her. Gen. Hyten told the Armed Services Committee that she made 34 different accusations against the Strategic Command hierarchy: 24 against the chief of staff, six against Gen. Hyten, two against his deputy commander, and two against the officer who investigated her. Charges ranged from conduct unbecoming an officer to misuse of a government cellphone. None of these accusations involved sexual misconduct. None were substantiated by the Army's Inspector General Office, and the Pentagon's Inspector General Office validated that conclusion.

Later, the Army Inspector General Office reported -- with the accuser's name redacted -- that it ""noted several inconsistencies between [Col. Spletstoser's] recollection of events and other evidence and testimony. . . . The preponderance of the credible evidence and witness testimony contradicted [Col. Spletstoser's] information."" By March 2019 Gen. Hyten, his staff and the Army investigator had been cleared of all charges.

Only in April, days after Gen. Hyten's nomination to the Joint Chiefs, did Col. Spletstoser accuse him of sexual assault. Yet it was not the first time she had leveled such charges against a superior officer.

In 2009, after a commander gave her a modest rating on an Officer Evaluation Report, Col. Spletstoser appealed it and accused the commander of sexually harassing her throughout her tour of duty in Iraq. The Army Board for the Correction of Military Records wrote that ""applicant's scorched earth attack on the OER, much of which is patently specious, undermines her overall credibility. Tellingly, applicant has proffered not a single statement from a third party supporting her version of events.""

Similarly, after the allegations against Gen. Hyten, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations interviewed 53 witnesses in three countries and found insufficient evidence to justify Col. Spletstoser's nine specific claims of sexual misconduct. What they did find was a host of verifiable contradictions of her account.

She claimed that damning evidence of Gen. Hyten's misconduct would be proved by email correspondence. Investigators reviewed 195,000 unique emails preserved by Stratcom servers, and turned up nothing.

She claimed Gen. Hyten called her frequently after her dismissal. A review of phone records Col. Spletstoser provided found no calls between the two after her firing.

She said she did not want to travel with Gen. Hyten due to his unwanted sexual advances. But multiple witnesses claimed she became livid after Gen. Hyten told her she was prohibited from traveling with his detail until her toxic-leadership investigation was resolved. Her screams from his office were loud enough to alarm Gen. Hyten's personal security detail, who rushed to the office.

As a critical link in America's nuclear chain of command, Gen. Hyten is one of the most closely guarded officers in the country. He must be responsive within minutes to the president. His every movement is supervised, and when he stays in hotels, guards closely observe the door to his room. Col. Spletstoser claimed that one instance of abuse happened after Gen. Hyten asked her to remain in his room following a staff meeting. But his security chief told investigators he had no recollection of such a request and would have recalled ""if she stayed in the room for any large amount of time.""

Sen. Martha McSally -- who has said a superior officer raped her when she served in the Air Force -- defended Gen. Hyten after she spent weeks reviewing his case. She was repaid with scorn and mockery on social media and in the press. Ms. McSally has my admiration for courageously standing up for the truth.

Col. Spletstoser maintains that her claims are true and that some have been corroborated. She has now demanded an opportunity to testify before the Senate. But Congress has wasted enough time on this petty theater. There must be consequences for dragging an innocent man and his family through hell. A thorough investigation found no evidence to corroborate her charges, multiple discrepancies and outright contradictions in her accusations, and a pattern of leveling specious charges throughout her career. For the good of the country, for the good of actual sexual assault survivors, and for the good of due process and other values we hold dear, the Senate should confirm Gen. Hyten as vice chairman.

For the same reasons, the Army should investigate Col. Spletstoser for perjury under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",8,Support,,,,,,,73,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

Simply put, the kind of U.S. withdrawal that was inadvisable in Iraq eight years ago would be indefensible for Afghanistan today.","The announcement of a peace agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban is said to be imminent, after years of
combat and months of negotiation. The U.S. will reportedly promise to reduce its military presence in Afghanistan
in exchange for a Taliban commitment to cooperate against international terrorism and enter direct talks with the
Afghan government.
For Americans as well as Afghans, any possibility of settling this conflict is cause for hope. But even as citizens in
both countries pray for peace, leaders in Washington must proceed with caution. While diplomatic progress with
the Taliban may justify a reduction in U.S. force levels, under no circumstances should the Trump administration
repeat the mistake its predecessor made in Iraq and agree to a total withdrawal of combat forces from
Afghanistan.
A complete military exit from Afghanistan today would be even more ill-advised and risky than the Obama
administration's disengagement from Iraq in 2011. Iraq had largely been stabilized by the time the last U.S.
combat elements left, with al Qaeda having been routed during the 2007 surge. In Afghanistan, by contrast, the
Taliban are far from defeated, while some 20 foreign terrorist organizations like al Qaeda and ISIS retain a
presence in the region. It is unlikely that any will join a peace deal.
The idea that the U.S. can leave if the Taliban promise to combat rather than conspire with these groups is also
wrongheaded. Until the Taliban demonstrate they have both the determination and the capability to work with the
Afghan government against international terrorists -- and there is ample reason to doubt this -- common sense
dictates the U.S. must retain its own means to pressure extremist networks plotting against the American
homeland and U.S. allies. This can be accomplished only by having some number of capable American forces in
Afghanistan, along with substantial ""enablers"" such as unmanned aerial vehicles and close air support.
While Iraq's sectarian unraveling after the U.S. withdrawal in 2011 was a possibility that some foresaw, it was far
from assured. If the Trump administration orders a full pullout from Afghanistan, there is considerably less doubt
about what will happen -- full-blown civil war and the re-establishment of a terrorist sanctuary as existed when the
9/11 attacks were planned there.
The Taliban have clearly indicated what they will try to do once U.S. forces are gone: overthrow the Afghan
government and reimpose medieval rule. Their resistance to a formal cease-fire, continued barbaric attacks on
civilians, and opposition to elections scheduled for this fall are all warning signs. Such a conflagration is likely to
reinvigorate the flagging fortunes of Islamist extremism world-wide and the global terrorist threat -- which, despite
the destruction of Islamic State's territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria, is by no means defeated.
Some have suggested that, should Afghanistan implode following the departure of American ground troops, the
U.S. can simply adopt an ""offshore"" counterterrorism strategy -- relying on drone strikes and targeted raids from
afar to disrupt plots. That is a fantasy. Unlike Yemen or Somalia, landlocked Afghanistan is distant from U.S. air
bases. For all the wizardry of technology, drones can fly only so fast and stay aloft only so long. Effective
counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan -- and, just as important, in neighboring tribal areas of Pakistan -- will
prove all but impossible absent an enduring U.S. footprint on Afghan soil.
Others say it still isn't worth staying even if Afghanistan is poised to collapse without U.S. troops. In an era of
resurgent great-power competition and record deficits, the thinking goes, keeping U.S. forces in Afghanistan is an
unaffordable distraction from other, more pressing national issues. This, too, is wrong. The cost of retaining a few
thousand troops in Afghanistan pales in comparison with the price the nation will pay, strategically and
economically, if al Qaeda or ISIS rebuilds a terrorist platform there.

The Obama administration left Iraq in part because it believed that doing so would free up resources for its
""rebalance"" in favor of Asia and domestic priorities. Instead, renewed instability in Iraq and the civil war in Syria
opened the door to ISIS, which promptly became the all-consuming problem for American national security and
compelled the administration to rush thousands of soldiers back to Iraq and later Syria. If the U.S. abandons
Afghanistan to chaos, this pattern is likely to repeat itself and the resulting crisis will once again dominate
Washington's foreign-policy bandwidth, to the detriment of its ability to manage other challenges, including China.
The alternative is to recognize that the U.S. doesn't need a plan for leaving but a strategy for staying -- one that
carefully minimizes American, coalition and Afghan costs and casualties but accepts the necessity of a sustained
and sustainable troop presence to safeguard vital U.S. interests.
We'll never know whether Iraq's collapse could have been averted had the Obama administration left a few
thousand combat troops there in 2011. What isn't debatable is that the U.S. would have been in a stronger
position to respond when the country's fragile politics began to fracture and could have reacted much more
rapidly when ISIS appeared.

If we don't end this war properly, we won't be ending it at all. Instead, we will be creating a much worse situation for everyone except for groups such as the Taliban, al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.","President Trump's desire to end the war in Afghanistan is understandable. After 18 years of war, the current path
is not sustainable.
Nevertheless, we may be in such a rush to remove our forces that we find ourselves on the cusp of a strategic
blunder. Any deal that calls for withdrawing our forces completely from Afghanistan is a bad deal for the United
States.
We must be clear: The United States should never outsource its national security to anyone, especially the
Taliban. That is a possible outcome, however, as the United States and the Taliban continue talks in Doha, Qatar.
We cannot rely on the Taliban for security; we have lost too many soldiers at Taliban hands for that. The Afghan
war must end on our terms, not the Taliban's.
The United States entered Afghanistan in 2001 for one reason: to run al-Qaeda out of its haven and ensure that it
was never able to attack America again. We achieved that objective in 2002 and have sustained it since with the
United States, NATO and other partner nations.
U.S. force levels have ebbed and flowed since 2002, but we now have less than 15 percent of the forces we had
at our peak in 2011. The tasks that used to be solely the responsibility of U.S. and NATO and partner forces are
now in the hands of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.
Afghan forces are shouldering the burden of the fighting and have lost tens of thousands of soldiers and police in
recent years protecting their country. We will have the ability to reduce our presence further as Afghan forces
become more capable. But if U.S. forces leave now, before Afghans are ready to stand by themselves, we will be
abandoning them when they still need our support.
Most importantly, American national security interests require that any agreement allow a meaningful U.S.
counterterrorism capability, coupled with a robust intelligence apparatus, to remain in Afghanistan to deal with the
real threats that will continue from groups such as the Islamic State's Afghan affiliate, ISIS-K. It is equally critical
that this force stay until the defense secretary and the secretary of state certify to Congress that withdrawing
troops from Afghanistan will not put the United States homeland and our interests at risk of another terrorist
attack.
We can never forget that when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 1996, they took the country backward,
destroying prosperity, oppressing women and operating with a total disregard for basic human rights. They also
welcomed Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda as honored guests. Bin Laden used his newfound freedom in
Afghanistan to plan, prepare and direct the attacks against two U.S. Embassies in Africa in 1998, the USS Cole in
Yemen in 2000 and the 9/11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans.
Following 9/11, President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand bin Laden over or face the
destruction of their regime. The Taliban refused to give him up and instead decided to stand with al-Qaeda.
Today, they have yet to repudiate al-Qaeda. Even if they take that step publicly as part of a deal with the United
States, there is no credible evidence that they would mean it.
Page 93 of 107 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The United States cannot contract out the American people's security to the Taliban who, in exchange for a U.S.
withdrawal, simply ""promise"" to guarantee that al-Qaeda and ISIS-K are denied haven.
Finally, we fear that a ""U.S. withdrawal deal"" with the Taliban would not end the war. It is much more likely to start
a new, far worse civil war as the Afghan forces would feel betrayed and abandoned, the Afghan government
would be severely undermined and weakened, and the Northern Alliance would withdraw its members from the
Afghan Army.
The added chaos with all U.S. troops gone would become an open invitation for al-Qaeda and the Islamic State to
refocus on Afghanistan, as they both did in Syria. In the midst of such a civil war, Taliban promises to keep
al-Qaeda out will mean less than nothing — they would not be able to fulfill them even if they wanted to.
History has taught that how we end a conflict is more important than how we start one. If we don't end this war
properly, we won't be ending it at all. Instead, we will be creating a much worse situation for everyone except for
groups such as the Taliban, al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.",6,Warfighting,,,,,,,73,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

But today, a core American legacy is at risk, as the Trump administration is reportedly considering issuing severe, unprecedented cuts — potentially even zeroing out — the bipartisan U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, the established legal means of entry for these deserving people.","America was founded as a safe haven to persecuted people and a beacon of hope, liberty and freedom to people around the world. Those themes reflect our values, and the welcoming of refugees to our shores is one of our proudest legacies and a fundamental part of who we are as a nation.

As military leaders, we spent nearly four decades defending these values. But today, a core American legacy is at risk, as the Trump administration is reportedly considering issuing severe, unprecedented cuts — potentially even zeroing out — the bipartisan U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, the established legal means of entry for these deserving people.

This week, we joined a group of 27 retired generals and admirals — all of whom have been operational leaders in military conflicts and exhibited courage in defending our values on the battlefield — in writing to President Trump expressing grave concerns about the direction of this vital program.

That's because for many of us, welcoming refugees is not just a matter of smart policy and a reflection of our national values; it is also personal. Many of us know these refugees: They worked for and with us in our fight against terrorists and insurgents. The tangible and significant improvements we were able to make in the lives of millions as well as efforts to protect our own soldiers, sailors and Marines would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan interpreters, logisticians, engineers and others.

Many of those individuals were targeted because of their assistance to us. They and their families have often been threatened for working with coalition forces, yet they bravely continued in their service at every level from translating conversations at the infantry squad level to contributing to task-force-level diplomatic missions. They may claim different cultures and speak different languages, but they have all put their lives on the line along with our citizens as part of our team.

Many of our partners continue to live in fear, given the continued hazardous situations in various parts of the world. In Iraq alone, more than 100,000 await entry to the United States. We promised our Iraqi partners support and safety when they were shoulder to shoulder with us fighting a despicable enemy. If today we turn these people away, or reduce the numbers who are allowed entry, it will be extremely difficult to ask others to assist us in the future.

Providing safety to people who assist American troops is a core function of our refugee program, but it does not stop there. We are living in a moment of unprecedented global displacement. Of the nearly 26 million refugees across the globe, most are hosted by low- and middle-income countries bordering the unstable areas that people are fleeing. A small proportion of the most vulnerable — less than 5 percent — are selected for resettlement. In addition to humanitarian assistance, resettling refugees is a concrete way that the United States offers support to these countries, while also strengthening regional stability and reducing the risk that people will be forced to return to conflict zones.

We know firsthand that both the humanitarian and strategic consequences of conflicts in Iraq, Syria, the Balkans and East and West Africa would be much worse had neighboring countries closed their borders. We also know that conflicts can restart when refugees are sent home prematurely. Of the 15 largest returns of refugees since 1990, a third have resulted in the resumption of conflict and the slaughter of innocents.

When we slam the door on refugees, we encourage other nations to do the same, contributing to a less compassionate and more dangerous world, one in which our military will increasingly be called to provide stability.

Over the past 40 years, the United States has welcomed about 3 million refugees from around the world who have gone on to contribute to and strengthen this country in immeasurable ways. The average refugee admission level across both Republican and Democratic administrations is 95,000 annually. Yet in the last two years, admissions have plummeted 75 percent.

In the next two weeks, the president will decide how many refugees we will admit in 2020. That decision will determine whether we uphold America's legacy as a haven for the persecuted, and it will send a powerful message to the world about who we are as a people. We strongly recommend that this lifesaving humanitarian program be restored to historic bipartisan-supported levels.",10,DomesticPolicy,,,,,,The authors discuss a topic outside of their area of expertise. ,73,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

I am suggesting, however, that neither side deserves support. Iran may well qualify as America's ""enemy."" But Saudi Arabia is not a ""friend,"" regardless of how many billions Riyadh spends purchasing American-manufactured weaponry and how much effort Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman invests in courting President Trump and members of his family.","In 1987, an Iraqi warplane attacked an American Navy frigate, the Stark, on patrol in the Persian Gulf. Accepting Saddam Hussein's explanation that the attack, which killed 37 sailors, had been an accident, American officials promptly used the episode, which came at the height of the Iran-Iraq war, to ratchet up pressure on Tehran. The incident provided the impetus for what became a brief, and all but forgotten, maritime war between the United States and Iran.

Last week, someone -- precisely who remains to be determined -- attacked two oil refineries in Saudi Arabia. American authorities have been quick to blame Iran, and the possibility of a violent confrontation between the two countries is once again growing. Before making a decision on whether to pull the trigger, President Trump would do well to reflect on that 1987 episode and its legacy.

Back then, the United States had become involved in the very bloody and seemingly interminable Iran-Iraq war, which Hussein had instigated in 1980 by invading Iran. As that war turned into a brutal stalemate, President Ronald Reagan and his advisers persuaded themselves that it was in America's interests to come to Iraq's aid. Iran was the ""enemy,"" so Iraq became America's ""friend.""

After the Stark episode, American and Iranian naval forces in the gulf began jousting, an uneven contest that culminated in April 1988 with the virtual destruction of the Iranian Navy.

Yet the United States gained little from this tidy victory. The principal beneficiary was Hussein, who wasted no time in repaying Washington by invading and annexing Kuwait soon after his war with Iran ground to a halt. Thus did America's ""friend"" become America's ""enemy.""

The encounter with Iran became a precedent-setting event and a font of illusions. Since then, a series of administrations have indulged the fantasy that the direct or indirect application of military power can somehow restore stability to the gulf.

In fact, just the reverse has occurred. Instability has become chronic, with the relationship between military policy and actual American interests in the region becoming ever more difficult to discern.

In 2019, this now well-established penchant for armed intervention finds the United States once more involved in a proxy conflict, this time a civil war that has ravaged Yemen since 2015. Saudi Arabia supports one side in this bloody and interminable conflict, and Iran the other.

Under President Barack Obama and now President Trump, the United States has thrown in its lot with Saudi Arabia, providing support comparable to what the Reagan administration gave Saddam Hussein back in the 1980s. But American-assisted Saudi forces have exhibited no more competence today than did American-assisted Iraqi forces back then. So the war in Yemen drags on.

Concrete American interests in this conflict, which has already claimed an estimated 70,000 lives while confronting as many as 18 million with the prospect of starvation, are negligible. Once more, as in the 1980s, the demonization of Iran has contributed to a policy that is ill advised and arguably immoral.

I am not suggesting that Washington is supporting the wrong side in Yemen. I am suggesting, however, that neither side deserves support. Iran may well qualify as America's ""enemy."" But Saudi Arabia is not a ""friend,"" regardless of how many billions Riyadh spends purchasing American-manufactured weaponry and how much effort Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman invests in courting President Trump and members of his family.

The conviction, apparently widespread in American policy circles, that in the Persian Gulf (and elsewhere) the United States is compelled to take sides, has been a source of recurring mischief. No doubt the escalating rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran poses a danger of further destabilizing the gulf. But the United States is under no obligation to underwrite the folly of one side or the other.

Supporting Iraq in its foolhardy war with Iran in the 1980s proved to be strategically shortsighted in the extreme. It yielded vastly more problems than it solved. It set in train a series of costly wars that have produced negligible benefits. Supporting Saudi Arabia today in its misbegotten war in Yemen is no less shortsighted.

Power confers choice, and the United States should exercise it. We can begin to do so by recognizing that Saudi Arabia's folly need not be our problem.",6,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,73,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

He is wrong. These are the virtues that have sustained this nation for the past 243 years. If we hope to continue to lead the world and inspire a new generation of young men and women to our cause, then we must embrace these values now more than ever.","If President Trump doesn't demonstrate the leadership that America needs, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office.

Last week I attended two memorable events that reminded me why we care so very much about this nation and also why our future may be in peril.

The first was a change of command ceremony for a storied Army unit in which one general officer passed authority to another. The second event was an annual gala for the Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.) Society that recognizes past and present members of the intelligence and Special Operations community for their heroism and sacrifice to the nation. What struck me was the stark contrast between the words and deeds heralded at those events -- and the words and deeds emanating from the White House.

On the parade field at Fort Bragg, N.C., where tens of thousands of soldiers have marched either preparing to go to war or returning from it, the two generals, highly decorated, impeccably dressed, cleareyed and strong of character, were humbled by the moment.

They understood the awesome responsibility that the nation had placed on their shoulders. They understood that they had an obligation to serve their soldiers and their soldiers' families. They believed in the American values for which they had been fighting for the past three decades. They had faith that these values were worth sacrificing everything for -- including, if necessary, their lives.

Having served with both officers for the past 20 years, I know that they personified all that is good and decent and honorable about the American military with genuineness of their humility, their uncompromising integrity, their willingness to sacrifice all for a worthy cause, and the pride they had in their soldiers.

Later that week, at the O.S.S. Society dinner, there were films and testimonials to the valor of the men and women who had fought in Europe and the Pacific during World War II. We also celebrated the 75th anniversary of D-Day, recognizing those brave Americans and allies who sacrificed so much to fight Nazism and fascism. We were reminded that the Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys -- that wherever there was oppression, tyranny or despotism, America would be there. We would be there because freedom mattered. We would be there because the world needed us and if not us, then who?

Also that evening we recognized the incredible sacrifice of a new generation of Americans: an Army Special Forces warrant officer who had been wounded three times, the most recent injury costing him his left leg above the knee. He was still in uniform and still serving. There was an intelligence officer, who embodied the remarkable traits of those men and women who had served in the O.S.S. And a retired Marine general, whose 40 years of service demonstrated all that was honorable about the Corps and public service.

But the most poignant recognition that evening was for a young female sailor who had been killed in Syria serving alongside our allies in the fight against ISIS. Her husband, a former Army Green Beret, accepted the award on her behalf. Like so many that came before her, she had answered the nation's call and willingly put her life in harm's way.

For everyone who ever served in uniform, or in the intelligence community, for those diplomats who voice the nation's principles, for the first responders, for the tellers of truth and the millions of American citizens who were raised believing in American values -- you would have seen your reflection in the faces of those we honored last week.

But, beneath the outward sense of hope and duty that I witnessed at these two events, there was an underlying current of frustration, humiliation, anger and fear that echoed across the sidelines. The America that they believed in was under attack, not from without, but from within.

These men and women, of all political persuasions, have seen the assaults on our institutions: on the intelligence and law enforcement community, the State Department and the press. They have seen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen, preferring their government narrative to our own. They have seen us abandon our allies and have heard the shouts of betrayal from the battlefield. As I stood on the parade field at Fort Bragg, one retired four-star general, grabbed my arm, shook me and shouted, ""I don't like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!""

Those words echoed with me throughout the week. It is easy to destroy an organization if you have no appreciation for what makes that organization great. We are not the most powerful nation in the world because of our aircraft carriers, our economy, or our seat at the United Nations Security Council. We are the most powerful nation in the world because we try to be the good guys. We are the most powerful nation in the world because our ideals of universal freedom and equality have been backed up by our belief that we were champions of justice, the protectors of the less fortunate.

But, if we don't care about our values, if we don't care about duty and honor, if we don't help the weak and stand up against oppression and injustice -- what will happen to the Kurds, the Iraqis, the Afghans, the Syrians, the Rohingyas, the South Sudanese and the millions of people under the boot of tyranny or left abandoned by their failing states?

If our promises are meaningless, how will our allies ever trust us? If we can't have faith in our nation's principles, why would the men and women of this nation join the military? And if they don't join, who will protect us? If we are not the champions of the good and the right, then who will follow us? And if no one follows us -- where will the world end up?

President Trump seems to believe that these qualities are unimportant or show weakness. He is wrong. These are the virtues that have sustained this nation for the past 243 years. If we hope to continue to lead the world and inspire a new generation of young men and women to our cause, then we must embrace these values now more than ever.

And if this president doesn't understand their importance, if this president doesn't demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office -- Republican, Democrat or independent -- the sooner, the better.

"Petraeus, David and Serchuk, Vance",2011,1,2019-11-14,,0,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Trump Was Right to Abandon the Peace Deal. Here's What a Good One Would Look Like. ,"Rather than re-embracing that agreement, the White House should demand a better one, while making clear to the Taliban and other extremists in the region that an enduring U.S. commitment to our Afghan counterterrorism partners is nonnegotiable.","Two months after President Trump declared U.S.-Taliban peace talks ""dead,"" diplomacy with the Afghan insurgents is reviving. With the administration already having negotiated a framework agreement with the Taliban, the key question now facing Washington is whether simply to dust off the settlement that was shelved in September or seek substantial revisions.

The Taliban's position is clear: It maintains that the text from earlier this year ""contains answers to all issues"" and ""only needs signing and implementation."" Yet the Taliban's enthusiasm for the deal underscores why the White House should reconsider its terms.

The predicate for any acceptable peace agreement with the Taliban ought to be their total, unequivocal break with international terrorism. It was, after all, two decades ago, when the Taliban was in power in Afghanistan, that its sheltering of al-Qaeda made possible the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and it was the Taliban's subsequent refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden that forced the United States to invade.

The experience of recent coalition military operations in Afghanistan, moreover, underscores that al-Qaeda's links to the Taliban remain strong.

Under the deal Trump set aside in September, the Taliban appeared willing to promise that Afghan territory under their control would never again be used to launch terrorist attacks against the outside world.

That is a compelling formula at first glance, but inadequate under scrutiny.

For starters, the Taliban as recently as this summer still wouldn't admit that al-Qaeda was the 9/11 perpetrator. As long as the group denies the facts about past acts of terrorism hatched under its aegis, it is impossible to take seriously its assurances about preventing future ones.

Even more fundamentally, a Taliban pledge not to allow foreign attacks from Afghan soil does not address the group's relationship with al-Qaeda and other Islamist extremists enjoying sanctuary in Pakistan. A peace deal that ignores this makes little sense.

The Taliban must pledge to break ties with designated terrorist groups everywhere and show through active cooperation with the United States their willingness to fight them.

Moreover, any Taliban deal that requires all U.S. forces to withdraw from Afghanistan should be a nonstarter. Precisely because the Taliban's counterterrorism promises are untrustworthy, it is essential for the United States to retain its own independent means to protect itself against extremist networks, which now include an Islamic State affiliate, in both Afghanistan and the surrounding region.

Exchanging America's military footprint in Afghanistan for Taliban commitments against al-Qaeda would be especially ill-considered. Under such an arrangement, the more the United States fulfills its end of the bargain, the less incentive the Taliban would have to live up to theirs — and the less ability Washington would have to detect or punish violations.

For that matter, if the Taliban is sincere about turning against groups such as al-Qaeda, why wouldn't it — like other U.S. counterterrorism partners around the world — welcome all the international help it can get against a common enemy?

The Taliban's vehement insistence that all U.S. troops leave Afghanistan strongly suggests that its purpose in peace talks isn't to transform its relationship with the United States but to evict its forces so that they can then overthrow the Afghan government — which, by contrast, has been a steadfast U.S. ally against terror.

Consequently, the Trump administration should insist that any peace agreement includes a nationwide cease-fire between the Taliban and the Afghan government, which should remain in place as the two parties then negotiate. Under no circumstances should Washington disengage from the Afghan battlefield while the Taliban is still rampaging on it.

The Taliban will of course resist all of this — conjuring the specter that the group might abandon diplomacy altogether in favor of continued violence, in the hope the United States will eventually give up and go home.

That is indeed a risk. But the right response isn't to accept a deal that compromises U.S. national security and abandons an important counterterrorism partner. The United States should instead adopt a force posture that is both sustained and sustainable, with our Afghan partners continuing to bear the overwhelming burden of the fight while the U.S. provides vital support. American diplomacy, meanwhile, can help offset the costs to the United States by securing additional forces and funding from allies worldwide.

Americans and Afghans are united in their desire for peace, but a bad deal with the Taliban would be worse than no deal at all — and from what is known about the accord that was on the table in September, it is likely for the best that Trump backed away.

Rather than re-embracing that agreement, the White House should demand a better one, while making clear to the Taliban and other extremists in the region that an enduring U.S. commitment to our Afghan counterterrorism partners is nonnegotiable.

Now is indeed the time to bring an end to our endless war.,"We need to press for an agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban and cement the parallel support of the Afghan government.

I took command of the United States Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment two months before the Sept. 11 attacks. Not long after, the regiment deployed to Afghanistan as part of the American effort to destroy Al Qaeda and remove the Taliban from power.

In the 18 years since, soldiers from the 75th Ranger Regiment, a Special Operations light-infantry unit, have always been deployed to Afghanistan. And as others did, I returned many times thereafter. During his Thanksgiving visit to American troops in Afghanistan, President Trump declared that he had reopened peace talks with the Taliban. The president’s announcement is a rare chance to end our longest war.

We are now in a position to seal a United States-Taliban agreement that would lead to intra-Afghan negotiations and move the conflict into the political realm. We should not miss this opportunity.

The war has exacted an overwhelming cost: 1,892 American military personnel killed in action and 20,589 wounded, about a trillion dollars spent, the psychological and emotional impact on veterans and their families, and similar material and human costs to our allies. And there is the devastating cost paid by the people of Afghanistan: Of the 147,000 killed in the war since 2001, more than 38,000 have been civilians. This long war must end.

The first opportunity to end this conflict on our terms was in 2002 when Al Qaeda was dispersed and the Taliban were shattered. A persistent political and diplomatic effort supported by steady military support could have put us on a different path. Instead, the intervening years brought one failed strategy after another, each for identifiable reasons: diverted attention, lack of military resources, loss of political will, arbitrary timelines, a resurgent and externally supported Taliban, fatigue in both the United States and Afghanistan and severe internal problems within the Afghan government.

The most recent opportunity to achieve our objectives emerged in August 2017 with the announcement of the Trump administration’s South Asia strategy, which earmarked political reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban as our principal objective.

At the time, I was commander of United States Central Command, responsible for our military operations in an area that spread from Egypt to Pakistan and Kazakhstan to Yemen — including Afghanistan. We recognized early that the South Asia strategy was a prudent and realistic way to put focus back into the political and diplomatic realm and that pursuing a political settlement was our best chance to end the war.

We also knew a quick resolution wasn’t possible given the obstacles: A fractured Afghan government, Pakistan continuing to enable the Taliban, the influence of Iran and Russia, mixed Afghan military performance, increasing high-profile insurgent attacks in urban areas of Afghanistan, lack of trust between the principal Afghan adversaries and emergence of a branch of the Islamic State in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan.

The United States continued working toward our objective, and there has been some progress since August 2017. There have been short cease-fires, a marked decrease in Pakistan interference, direct talks with the Taliban, preliminary agreements and a prisoner exchange. But there has also been continuing violence, a breakdown in talks and a continuing lack of trust between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

The Taliban refused to open direct talks with the Afghan government, so the United States took a first step toward peace by opening peace negotiations with them, which we hoped would lead to internal Afghan-Taliban negotiations.

Despite the uneven progress on the ground, the special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief American negotiator, supported by American and coalition forces, continued to press for peace. Even after the peace negotiations stopped in September following a spike in Taliban violence, Mr. Khalilzad continued his shuttle diplomacy to preserve this tenuous opportunity.

On Saturday Mr. Khalilzad rejoined negotiations with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar. We need to press for an agreement between the United States and the Taliban and cement the parallel support of the Afghan government. This would lead within days to the initiation of direct meetings between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

Specific agreed-upon conditions would then drive the pace of the withdrawal of American forces. But the Taliban must demonstrate commitment to our shared objectives of a reduction in violence, make an unambiguous break from Al Qaeda and commit to continued (and effective) operations against the Islamic State.

The initial objective should be a comprehensive and enduring cease-fire. This approach can provide us a way to consolidate the gains of the past 18 years and achieve our stated objective of ensuring that we will never absorb another attack on our homeland from Afghanistan.

Some may argue that the Taliban cannot be trusted and will never live up to their commitments, and this may be true. But we can put in place measures that will allow us, and the international community, to observe, monitor and enforce whatever agreement is finally reached.

President Trump often highlights the need to “end the endless wars.” We should end this one by pursuing the difficult and sometimes messy political and diplomatic process that includes talking, finding compromise and setting conditions to forge new relationships.

I have retired from the United States Army, but soldiers from the 75th Ranger Regiment — some born after the Sept. 11 attacks — are still deployed in Afghanistan.

Now is the time to seize a fleeting opportunity and fully support internal Afghan negotiations. We should put ourselves in the position to shift our focus to enforcing peace and greater stability in Afghanistan. Now is indeed the time to bring an end to our endless war.

"Connable, Ben",,1,2020-01-06,,1,0,LA Times,Marine Corps,,,M,Iran's Swift Revenge in Iraq; Iraq's Vote on Sunday to Oust US Troops is a Big Victory for Iran,"If US policymakers and diplomats can settle on a long-term strategy for Iraq, a deal might be reached that could benefit both sides.","Without firing a shot, Iran appears to have executed a devastating revenge attack against the United States for the killing of Gen. Qassem Suleimani. Using Iraq's democratic process, Iranian-influenced members of parliament on Sunday voted to expel American soldiers from Iraq. With that, Iran may have effectively won the battle of influence in Iraq.

This strategic coup de grace was delivered not by rockets or suicide vests, but by legitimate votes in a democracy built by the United States.

Assuming the Iraqi prime minister signs this nonbinding bill into law -- there is some chance he may not -- American troops would have to be withdrawn. The Strategic Framework Agreement that established the basis for U.S. military presence in Iraq is unequivocal: ""The temporary presence of U.S. forces in Iraq is at the full request and invitation of the sovereign Government of Iraq and with full respect for the sovereignty of Iraq.""

Iraqis are very likely to think that the United States violated Iraqi sovereignty in the drone attack in Baghdad that killed Suleimani and others, including Iraqi citizens, however nefarious they may have been.

The impacts could be far-reaching and damaging to American strategic interests. No troops on the ground, and ostensibly no aircraft overhead, will mean American forces will lose visibility of -- and the ability to strike directly -- Islamic State targets in Iraq.

It is possible the entire Combined Joint Task Force command currently leading the fight against Islamic State might have to be relocated from Baghdad.

Operations in Syria that are heavily dependent on support from Iraq would be severely weakened. Large coalition bases would have to be closed, leaving European allies and contractors with little choice but to also withdraw from Iraq.

Unless Iraqis also fully reject Iranian presence (an unlikely event), the United States would have to consider Iraq effectively lost to Iran. The so-called Shiite crescent stretching from Iran through Iraq to the Levant has been brought closer to reality. If Iran can maintain its foothold in Iraq, it now has won its land bridge across the crescent.

If American soldiers are ejected, the Iraqi security forces will lose their most capable and beneficent ally. Iraqis prosecuting the ongoing counterinsurgency against Islamic State would be in serious trouble.

American advisors who have provided logistics and medical support would disappear. The Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service, which has long been dependent on American support, would be cut loose to fend for itself.

In all likelihood the multibillion-dollar U.S. Counter-ISIL Train and Equip Fund, the primary source of funding for Iraq's security forces, would come to a halt as the Americans distributing the equipment are kicked out of the country. American aid to Iraqi civilians suffering from the recent war could very well dry up.

How did we get here? Did the U.S. walk into an Iranian strategic trap?

Perhaps, but if so, it is in part because the United States has been without a focused long-term strategy in Iraq for years. The Strategic Framework Agreement established in 2008 was shaky from the start.

There are two practical options left for the United States in Iraq. President Trump can take this expulsion as an opportunity to reduce America's involvement in overseas conflicts. Iraq could be effectively dumped into Iranian hands with the hopes that they would make a mess of it and, in turn, be expelled by increasingly frustrated Iraqis. This would seem to be a strategy of hope, and hope is not a strategy.

The other option would be to quickly renegotiate American military presence in Iraq. If the United States could maintain an advisor position, it might be able hold on to its combined counter-Islamic State headquarters and continue funding the training and equipment. All of these things are in Iraq's interest and they could be renegotiated if American diplomats were empowered to do so.

A reset in United States-Iraqi relations and a renegotiation of the Strategic Framework Agreement was needed before the current crisis.

If U.S. policymakers and diplomats can settle on a long-term strategy for Iraq, a deal might be reached that could benefit both sides.

This would help blunt Iran's victory, reinforce Iraqi sovereignty and normalize relations that have been anything but normal for far too long.",5,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

Joe was dismissed for doing his job: overseeing the dissemination of intelligence to elected officials who needed that information to do their jobs.","Edmund Burke, the Irish statesman and philosopher, once said: 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.' Over the course of the past three years, I have watched good men and women, friends of mine, come and go in the Trump administration "" all trying to do something "" all trying to do their best. Jim Mattis, John Kelly, H.R. McMaster, Sue Gordon, Dan Coats and, now, Joe Maguire, who until this week was the acting director of national intelligence.

I have known Joe for more than 40-years. There is no better officer, no better man and no greater patriot. He served for 36 years as a Navy SEAL. In 2004, he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral and was chosen to command all of Naval Special Warfare, including the SEALs. Those were dark days for the SEALs. Our combat losses from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were the highest in our history, and Joe and his wife, Kathy, attended every SEAL funeral, providing comfort and solace to the families of the fallen.

But it didn't stop there. Not a day went by that the Maguires didn't reach out to some Gold Star family, some wounded SEAL, some struggling warrior. Every loss was personal, every family precious. When Joe retired in 2010, he tried the corporate world. But his passion for the Special Operations soldiers was so deep that he left a lucrative job and took the position as the president of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, a charity that pays for educating the children of fallen warriors.

In 2018, Joe was asked to be the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, a job he knew well from his last assignment as a vice admiral. He accepted, but within months of his arrival came the announcement of Coats's departure as director of national intelligence. Maguire didn't seek to fill the job; he was asked to do it by the president. At first he declined, suggesting that Sue Gordon, Coats's deputy, would be better suited for the job.

But the president chose Maguire. And, like most of these good men and women, he came in with the intent to do his very best, to follow the rules, to follow the law and to follow what was morally right. Within a few weeks of taking the assignment, he found himself embroiled in the Ukraine whistleblower case. Joe told the White House that, if asked, he would testify, and he would tell the truth. He did. In short order, he earned the respect of the entire intelligence community. They knew a good man was at the helm. A man they could count on, a man who would back them, a man whose integrity was more important than his future employment.

But, of course, in this administration, good men and women don't last long. Joe was dismissed for doing his job: overseeing the dissemination of intelligence to elected officials who needed that information to do their jobs.

As Americans, we should be frightened "" deeply afraid for the future of the nation.

days of no sleep, constant physical and mental harassment, and one ""special day"" at the Mud Flats. The Mud
Flats are an area between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, where the water comes together and creates a
swampy patch of terrain, a muddy bog that tests your determination to be a SEAL.
My training class had been out of the mud for a short period of time when the instructors, looking to weed out the
weak of mind and body, ordered the entire group of 55 men back into the bog. The mud consumed each man
until there was nothing visible but our heads. We were all exhausted, numb from the cold and desperate to hold
on. The instructors told us that we could all leave the mud - if just five men quit. It was the instructors' way of
turning us against each other.
It was apparent that some of the trainees were about to give up. There were still eight hours to go before the sun
rose - eight more hours of bone-chilling cold. Several of the students started moving to dry ground; they were
ready to quit. And then, one voice began to echo through the night - one voice raised in song. The song was
terribly out of tune but sung with great enthusiasm. One voice became two, and two became three, and before
long the entire class was singing. The instructors threatened us with more time in the mud if we kept singing, but
the singing persisted. Those of us stuck in the mud believed that if one of us could start singing when he was up
to his neck in mud, then maybe the rest of us could make it through the night. And we did.
Today, the coronavirus has thrown us all in the mud. We are cold, wet and miserable, and the dawn seems a long
way off. But while we should not be cavalier about the dangers of this pandemic, neither should we feel hopeless
and paralyzed with fear. Hope abounds.
We have the greatest scientists in the world working to create a vaccine. Health-care workers are pulling double
shifts to care for the sick. Republicans and Democrats have come together to find solutions. State and local
officials are taking decisive steps to flatten the curve of infection. Our economy is strong enough to survive even
in these challenging times. The United States has an unmatched ability to mobilize when called to action. More
importantly, as we always have in times of crisis, Americans are rallying together, caring for one another, showing
the compassion and concern that have always characterized this nation of good people.

Al",2008,0,2020-03-22,,1,0,WaPO,Air Force,,,M,A Dangerous Purge,"Congress must reinvigorate the strictest of oversight to preserve what is left of the country's prized, apolitical intelligence community…the administration's continued politicization of intelligence pulls the nation farther from this goal, making us more vulnerable to the next national security threat regardless from where it emanates. ","The United States - and the world - faces a historic threat to its health, well-being and economy. The global covid-19 pandemic challenges all of us: the public, cities, states and, of course, the federal government. But as we collectively fight this deadly disease, the intelligence institutions that help protect us all from current and future threats are also under attack from an insidious enemy: domestic politics. We cannot let the covid-19 pandemic be a cover for the deeply destructive path being pursued by the Trump administration.

The most recent illustration of this unprecedented attack is the continuing dismissal of career intelligence professionals - officers who have ably served both Republican and Democratic administrations regardless of their personal political stripe. Specifically, the unceremonious removal last week of the leadership of the National Counterterrorism Center. The NCTC, though not as recognized an entity as its intelligence community counterparts such as the CIA, FBI and the National Security Agency, is one of the crown-jewel creations of the United States' post-9/11 reforms.

Created to ""connect the dots"" and coordinate U.S. counterterrorism operational planning, the NCTC brings together representatives from across the federal government to maintain critical watch lists, monitor threats in real time and make sure that the disparate elements of the massive federal bureaucracy respond in a coordinated fashion. In short: Since 9/11, the NCTC has helped do for counterterrorism what the U.S. government is now trying to piece together against its new viral threat.

Although we were heartened to see President Trump nominate an experienced Special Operations officer to serve as the next Senate-confirmed director of the NCTC, we are deeply dismayed - and perplexed - as to why he would simultaneously gut the center's leadership of critical institutional knowledge. The NCTC's just-dismissed acting director, Russell Travers, began his career as an Army intelligence officer more than 40 years ago. He stood up the NCTC's predecessor organization while the embers of Ground Zero still smoldered. He built the terrorism watch list from a set of index cards into the envy of countries around the world (and, it should be noted, as the model for the president's own aspirational watch list to screen travelers to the United States for threats other than terrorism). Travers and his deputy, a career National Security Agency officer, were the epitome of what we strive for in national security: nonpartisan experts who serve the president and the American people with no regard to personal politics.

Now both are gone, to be replaced by as-yet-unnamed acting heads who will undoubtedly know less and who will be more beholden to the intelligence community's politicized leadership. The next acting heads might or might not be gone themselves in a matter of months if the president's nominee is ultimately confirmed. In the meantime, who manages the critical security tasks, including watch-listing and ensuring that the government-wide counterterrorism structure remains well integrated?

Even amid public health concerns, we cannot be distracted from how deeply destructive these removals are to our nation's safety. To be clear: This is not just about protecting a few senior officers. These unceremonious removals send a damaging message across the intelligence community. Every current officer sees that speaking truth to power in this administration is an immediate career-killer. Every young recruit will conclude that joining the intelligence community is little different from signing up for any other politicized element of the federal bureaucracy. Countless more talented young Americans will decide that federal service, indeed public service, is not a worthy calling.

We do not suggest that post-9/11 reforms should be etched in stone. All healthy institutions should evolve with changing circumstances, and the NCTC as well as the rest of government must adapt as circumstances change. But the gutting of the intelligence community's experienced professionals is not reform. It is politicization, pure and simple. It is destructive of our nation's ideals, and it puts us all at risk.

Congress must reinvigorate the strictest of oversight to preserve what is left of the country's prized, apolitical intelligence community. Post-9/11 reforms happened for a critical reason: The U.S. bureaucracy wasn't prepared for a new era of threats. Indeed, the NCTC is a model of how the government should work in close coordination and with unity of effort in response to a crisis. It provides critical lessons for today's challenge. The administration's continued politicization of intelligence pulls the nation further from this goal, making us more vulnerable to the next national security threat regardless from where it emanates.",10,Warfighting,1,1,,,,The authors are claiming the President has politicized the intelligence community and that specific actions should be taken (by Congress) to reverse this politicization.,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Kelly, Scott",,0,2020-03-24,,1,0,NYT,Navy,,,M,"I Spent a Year in Space, and I Have Tips on Isolation to Share","I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over some of the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one if we all do our part and work together as a team.","Take it from someone who couldn’t: Go outside.

Being stuck at home can be challenging. When I lived on the International Space Station for nearly a year, it wasn’t easy. When I went to sleep, I was at work. When I woke up, I was still at work. Flying in space is probably the only job you absolutely cannot quit.

But I learned some things during my time up there that I’d like to share — because they are about to come in handy again, as we all confine ourselves at home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Here are a few tips on living in isolation, from someone who has been there.

Follow a schedule

On the space station, my time was scheduled tightly, from the moment I woke up to when I went to sleep. Sometimes this involved a spacewalk that could last up to eight hours; other times, it involved a five-minute task, like checking on the experimental flowers I was growing in space. You will find maintaining a plan will help you and your family adjust to a different work and home life environment. When I returned to Earth, I missed the structure it provided and found it hard to live without.

But pace yourself

When you are living and working in the same place for days on end, work can have a way of taking over everything if you let it. Living in space, I deliberately paced myself because I knew I was in it for the long haul — just like we all are today. Take time for fun activities: I met up with crewmates for movie nights, complete with snacks, and binge-watched all of “Game of Thrones” — twice.

And don’t forget to include in your schedule a consistent bedtime. NASA scientists closely study astronauts’ sleep when we are in space, and they have found that quality of sleep relates to cognition, mood, and interpersonal relations — all essential to getting through a mission in space or a quarantine at home.

Go outside

One of the things I missed most while living in space was being able to go outside and experience nature. After being confined to a small space for months, I actually started to crave nature — the color green, the smell of fresh dirt, and the feel of warm sun on my face. That flower experiment became more important to me than I could have ever imagined. My colleagues liked to play a recording of Earth sounds, like birds and rustling trees, and even mosquitoes, over and over. It brought me back to earth. (Although occasionally I found myself swatting my ears at the mosquitoes. )

For an astronaut, going outside is a dangerous undertaking that requires days of preparation, so I appreciate that in our current predicament, I can step outside any time I want for a walk or a hike — no spacesuit needed. Research has shown that spending time in nature is beneficial for our mental and physical health, as is exercise. You don’t need to work out two and a half hours a day, as astronauts on the space station do, but getting moving once a day should be part of your quarantine schedule (just stay at least six feet away from others).

You need a hobby

When you are confined in a small space you need an outlet that isn’t work or maintaining your environment.

Some people are surprised to learn I brought books with me to space. The quiet and absorption you can find in a physical book — one that doesn’t ping you with notifications or tempt you to open a new tab — is priceless. Many small bookstores are currently offering curbside pickup or home delivery service, which means you can support a local business while also cultivating some much-needed unplugged time.

You can also practice an instrument (I just bought a digital guitar trainer online), try a craft, or make some art. Astronauts take time for all of these while in space. (Remember Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield’s famous cover of David Bowie’s Space Oddity?)

Keep a journal

NASA has been studying the effects of isolation on humans for decades, and one surprising finding they have made is the value of keeping a journal. Throughout my yearlong mission, I took the time to write about my experiences almost every day. If you find yourself just chronicling the days’ events (which, under the circumstances, might get repetitive) instead try describing what you are experiencing through your five senses or write about memories. Even if you don’t wind up writing a book based on your journal like I did, writing about your days will help put your experiences in perspective and let you look back later on what this unique time in history has meant.

Take time to connect

Even with all the responsibilities of serving as commander of a space station, I never missed the chance to have a videoconference with family and friends. Scientists have found that isolation is damaging not only to our mental health, but to our physical health as well, especially our immune systems. Technology makes it easier than ever to keep in touch, so it’s worth making time to connect with someone every day — it might actually help you fight off viruses.

Listen to experts

I’ve found that most problems aren’t rocket science, but when they are rocket science, you should ask a rocket scientist. Living in space taught me a lot about the importance of trusting the advice of people who knew more than I did about their subjects, whether it was science, engineering, medicine, or the design of the incredibly complex space station that was keeping me alive.

Especially in a challenging moment like the one we are living through now, we have to seek out knowledge from those who know the most about it and listen to them. Social media and other poorly vetted sources can be transmitters of misinformation just as handshakes transmit viruses, so we have to make a point of seeking out reputable sources of facts, like the World Health Organization and the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.

We are all connected

Seen from space, the Earth has no borders. The spread of the coronavirus is showing us that what we share is much more powerful than what keeps us apart, for better or for worse. All people are inescapably interconnected, and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will all be.

One of the side effects of seeing Earth from the perspective of space, at least for me, is feeling more compassion for others. As helpless as we may feel stuck inside our homes, there are always things we can do — I’ve seen people reading to children via videoconference, donating their time and dollars to charities online, and running errands for elderly or immuno-compromised neighbors. The benefits for the volunteer are just as great as for those helped.

I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over some of the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one if we all do our part and work together as a team.

"McChrystal, Stanley and Fussell, Chris",2010,1,2020-03-24,,1,0,NYT,Army,,,M,9/11's Lessons on Crisis Leadership,"We are now weathering a once-in-a-hundred-year event, and Americans are hurt -- physically, emotionally, financially, and spiritually. Leaders at all levels in society need to embrace the changes this crisis brings rather than struggle against it. Your people need you. This is your moment, and you can rise to it.","Sept. 11 changed how U.S. Special Forces operated -- and offers lessons for today's leaders.

On Sept. 11, 2001, the job of every leader in the U.S. Special Operations community changed. In the ensuing years of fighting a highly complex, networked enemy, we redesigned how our organization communicated, shared information, made decisions and, most critically, maintained a cohesive culture while operating in almost every corner of the globe.

We're seeing a similar challenge today -- except this time, it's facing the leadership of practically every organization in the world, from governments to Fortune 500 companies to the smallest nonprofit. They are now managing their teams through a crisis with no clear end in sight.

Today's leaders didn't ask for this new role. But if history shows us one thing, it is that our greatest leaders emerge from the darkest moments.

Leaders must be visible with their plans, honest with their words and adaptable with their actions -- all while maintaining compassion for the situation and the impact it is having on their team. As part of our work at the McChrystal Group, we are in constant contact with scores of leaders around the country. For the past week, they have been fielding a constant stream of queries from customers and employees, and going through a series of increasingly drastic changes to how they will run their business.

Understandably, these leaders are already weary from a succession of crisis response meetings and market assessments designed to get their team through this change. While tiring, these are all necessary efforts. But the leaders we've spoken with also recognize that these are simply the very first steps of a marathon. They know that the real challenge lies ahead.

In any crisis, there is a natural temptation to simply wait it out. Today's leaders cannot give in to this instinct. We're facing a perfect storm of economic downturn, social isolation and a fast-spreading pandemic. The answer to this problem will not suddenly reveal itself; leaders must create solutions. Any leaders who are not already on a war footing and preparing to fundamentally change their organizations for the foreseeable future must start moving today.

Here's what that means.

First, don't hunker down. At the height of the Royal Navy's dominance, British naval officers, impressive in ornate uniforms, were expected to stand erect on the ship's decks during battles, clearly exposed to enemy fire. It was not that little value was placed on their lives. Rather, ever greater value was placed on their leadership. Their job was to be visible to their sailors, and show calm amid the chaos. Today's leaders must also stand and be visible to their organizations, their communities, and their families.

Second, demonstrate candor -- and demand it from the leaders below you. In combat, when things look bad, the front-line troops always know it before the leadership. Denying reality makes your people assume you're either lying or out of touch. Organizations can handle bad news and tough times if they feel their leaders are focused on solving the issues at hand. Today's leaders must be honest with their people to a level that will and should feel uncomfortable.

Third, give up more authority than feels natural. Fighting through complexity requires quick and informed action at the edge. This is dependent upon fast, transparent and inclusive communication. Organizations will need teammates making independent decisions close to the point of action, not waiting for direction. It's tempting in times of crisis to grab the reins and yank back, but this will be more disruptive than it is helpful. Be connected, listen and adapt based on what your front line is telling you.

Finally, be more compassionate than you think you need to be. As your organization disperses to remote-work status, the loss of personal interactions will quickly sink in. It will be easy for leaders to overlook or undervalue the fear and stress their people are feeling because of this isolation. All of us learn by watching our teammates, and we gain confidence through informal feedback from our colleagues or bosses. Your organization has lost that person-to-person contact. You must immediately take your culture online, and learn to reinforce camaraderie, esteem, and compassion, via digital platforms.

We know how hard this is: We've been there. Fifteen years ago, in the throes of our fight against Al Qaeda, the Joint Special Operations Command, where both of us served, needed to do this exact thing. We pivoted from being a centrally located, thousands-strong enterprise to a network of small teams spread around the world.

""Digital leadership"" was not in the job description for our generation, but it became a critical skill for all of us to learn in the fast-moving and constantly changing fight. At the height of the Iraq war, though units and leaders moved constantly across the battlefield, a vast majority of our interactions were by videoconference. We became the military's ultimate remote-work force.

The most important of those digital forums among our 25,000-person enterprise was a daily, 90-minute video call where more than 7,000 members of our command across all the time zones ""met"" to discuss our efforts. The effectiveness of our leaders depended not upon wisdom or charisma, but on a willingness to leverage somewhat awkward video and other digital media to connect, listen, learn and inspire a team, most of whom would never be in the same room with one another.

We lived on that cadence for many years straight, staring into cameras the majority of the day. Now leaders everywhere need to follow suit. In the near term, it will make everything more cumbersome -- it's harder to express sympathy through a computer screen, harder to deliver nuanced criticism when not in person, harder to read tone and body language. You can and must learn these skills, but it will take focus and effort. If you embrace it, you can form a new and stronger culture.

After a year into what we'd been calling ""temporary"" adjustments, we stopped talking about getting back to the old way of business. That Special Operations Task Force, the world's best counterterrorism organization, is now on its fifth generation of digital leadership, and it is more capable and cohesive than we would have ever imagined possible. Accept that some of these changes are more than a temporary inconvenience, believe in yourself and your people, show confidence in your organization's ability to adapt, and you will come through this crisis stronger than might seem possible today.

We are now weathering a once-in-a-hundred-year event, and Americans are hurt -- physically, emotionally, financially, and spiritually. Leaders at all levels in society need to embrace the changes this crisis brings rather than struggle against it. Your people need you. This is your moment, and you can rise to it.",10,Support,,,,,,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Stavridis, James",2013,1,2020-04-14,,1,0,NYT,Navy,,,M,What Was Life Like for Sailors During the Battle of the Atlantic?,"The Battle of the Atlantic was, as the Duke of Wellington said about the desperately close Battle of Waterloo, a “nearest-run thing.” By early May 1945, the battle saw its last actions, and the remaining U-boats were surrendered. The sailors had earned the crucial victory they delivered, though only after a brutal toll was exacted, with about 3,500 Allied merchant ships sunk and 72,200 Allied deaths. In the end, the battle was key to defeating Nazi Germany and assuring an Allied victory in Europe.","In the winter of 1994, I was sailing off the coast of Norway in the guided-missile destroyer U.S.S. Barry — my first stint as a ship’s captain. Even given the ship’s 8,000-ton size — vastly larger than the corvettes (small warships) and destroyers of World War II — we were pitching and rolling viciously in the harsh winter seas. As I walked the unstable decks and talked to my sailors standing the long night watches, I told them about the Battle of the Atlantic.

These waters had been the scene of the most difficult and longest naval campaign of the war, with over 100,000 deaths from both sides and close to 5,000 vessels sunk in hundreds of combat encounters. Most of my sailors were in their early 20s, and barely remembered the recently concluded Cold War, let alone the ancient history of World War II. Yet as a destroyer sailor, I knew that you could drop a plumb line from the thousands of North Atlantic voyages of 1939-1945 directly to my young team struggling to keep their dinner rations down in the churning waters half a century later. While the conditions were challenging for us, they were far better than those faced by those brave crews. So what was a day like for those hardy mariners of the turbulent and pivotal Atlantic battle?

First and foremost in every sailor’s mind was the looming presence of the sea and weather — in many cases their most dangerous foe. Sailors would be shaken awake in the middle of the night for the long, dark midwatch, from midnight to 4 in the morning, tumbling out of canvas bunks jammed by the dozens in tiny sleeping compartments. Every man in the ship would have an intuitive sense of the weather after rising, feeling the pitch and yaw of the ship in the harsh seas. But most would check with the quartermaster — the ship’s on-duty navigator and meteorologist up on the bridge — to get a sense of whether the barometer was rising or falling, and what the next day or so would bring. If they could snatch another hour of sleep after the midwatch, they would count themselves lucky indeed, as the exhausting quality of the ever-present seas hung over every task.

The ship itself — in effect, almost a living being — posed another kind of daily challenge. On the long convoy runs, the sailors would be working around the clock on its vital maintenance. Down in the guts of the engineering plant, where temperatures could soar even on the coldest days, the “snipes” would be fueling and oiling the engines, flushing the bearings, sampling the freshwater generators and checking every aspect of the electrical generators. Losing power at sea could be a death sentence for a ship, second only to a torpedo from a lurking U-boat, especially in deteriorating weather.

[Sign up for the At War newsletter for more about World War II.]

Up on the weather decks, the watch standers would be struggling to hold their footing while working on the topside gear as green seawater crashed over the slippery steel. A failure to maintain any of the dozens of critical systems on the relatively primitive ships — propulsion, electricity, freshwater, weapons, even signal lamps — could prove fatal to those vessels, so the sailors worked endlessly and sleeplessly to be ready for instant combat. Alongside the weather, the health of the ship itself dominated their long days and nights.

But the most feared eventuality of all was the sudden appearance of an enemy U-boat. The ship’s days could be relatively routine for long stretches, but extreme vigilance was required while watching the distant horizon where the sky met the sea under the low, gray, scudding clouds. That routine could change suddenly with a chance sighting of a periscope, a frantic radio or light signal from one of the merchant vessels under protection, or, worst of all, the hissing wake of a torpedo headed inbound.

At that moment, the ship would order “general quarters,” meaning all hands had to sprint to their individual battle stations. Every weapons and sensor system in the ship would be manned, the damage control stations — essentially firefighting lockers throughout the ship — would be fully operational and the captain would be on the bridge. That sudden call to battle would give every man a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, knowing that a prowling U-boat had penetrated the screen of defensive warships. Primitive sonars would sonically pulse the water, depth charges would be dropped over the side and the cat-and-mouse warfare between destroyer and U-boat would be underway — though the outcome would remain uncertain.

What about the other side? In many ways, for the German and Italian submariners, conditions were even worse. Their boats were smellier with diesel fumes as well as smaller, their food was scarcer and the lack of at least a glimpse of the sea induced an ongoing, terrifying claustrophobia. With far smaller crews, manning the ship was essentially a 24/7 job, with all hands always on deck. Allied weapons and sensors improved steadily, and the surface ships could use depth charges, explosive mortar rounds and even surface guns against the U-boats once the vital element of surprise was lost. The possibility of plunging to the bottom of the sea while still alive, locked into what amounted to a steel coffin as the deepwater pressure crushed the hull, was the stuff of nightmares — yet for those U-boat crews it was all too often how they died. Many hundreds of the boats were lost over the course of the campaign, with a staggering 75 percent casualty rate.

On both sides, it was the leadership of the captains that kept the crews on task, day after day and night after night. A ship’s captain is deeply and personally responsible for every man and woman on the ship, and that level of command creates an unfathomable sense of pressure that hangs on your back like a heavy weight. I felt that way for my crew, even in the relatively less dangerous years of the Cold War. What those young captains felt during World War II would have been an acute sense of foreboding and danger hard to imagine today.

In his brilliant and tragic novel about the Battle of the Atlantic, “The Cruel Sea,” Nicholas Monsarrat talks about the qualities of the captain of a fictional British corvette called the Compass Rose. “The captain carried them all. For him, there was no fixed watch, no time set aside when he was free to relax and, if he could, to sleep,” he wrote. “He was strong, calm, uncomplaining and wonderfully dependable. That was the sort of captain to have.”

Not every real-life crew had a captain like that, but those who did were far more likely to succeed in the face of bone-grinding, exhausting and dangerous work — a task that in the end was the hinge upon which the great door of victory would finally swing.

The Battle of the Atlantic was, as the Duke of Wellington said about the desperately close Battle of Waterloo, a “nearest-run thing.” By early May 1945, the battle saw its last actions, and the remaining U-boats were surrendered. The sailors had earned the crucial victory they delivered, though only after a brutal toll was exacted, with about 3,500 Allied merchant ships sunk and 72,200 Allied deaths. In the end, the battle was key to defeating Nazi Germany and assuring an Allied victory in Europe.",10,Support,,,,,,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Atlas, Scott and McMaster, H.R.",2018,1,2020-04-28,,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Relying on Foreign Drugs is Dangerous; Generics are Often Made in China. Time to diversify the Supply Chain.,"Health security is critical to national security. The Covid-19 pandemic is a moment to re-evaluate U.S.
dependence on China for pharmaceutical ingredients and to solidify the pharmaceutical supply chain in advance
of proliferating threats.","Health security is critical to national security. The Covid-19 pandemic is a moment to re-evaluate U.S. dependence on China for pharmaceutical ingredients and to solidify the pharmaceutical supply chain in advance of proliferating threats.

Americans filled the equivalent of 5.8 billion 30-day prescriptions in 2018. That doesn't count the hundreds of millions of vaccinations administered annually. In 2019 the Food and Drug Administration estimated that 40% of finished medications and 80% of active pharmaceutical ingredients were manufactured overseas, mainly in China and India.

While U.S. pharmaceutical companies may preserve redundancy in their sources for patented drugs, the generic drug business, which accounts for more than 90% of all U.S. prescriptions, prioritizes low cost over supply-chain resiliency. Most generics, including antibiotics, are imported from India—and India imports some 70% of its active ingredients from China. America needs to understand and diversify sources of supply, as well as maintain a strategic reserve of antibiotics and the key drugs for the most prevalent serious diseases.

Beyond scale and complexity, details on drug manufacturing are opaque and complex. The Food and Drug Administration requires country-of-origin markings, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in February that processing ingredients into tablets in the U.S. is enough to constitute ""manufacturing."" A drug made into tablets in the U.S. with active ingredients from India may list only the U.S. as ""principal place of business"" for FDA purposes. Labeling should be straightforward, but not at the sacrifice of security.

Protecting the drug supply also requires guarding against poor-quality and counterfeit medications, a repeated problem of medications from China in particular. Although the FDA conducts 3,500 inspections of generic plants a year, additional measures are necessary. More than half of FDA inspections are conducted on foreign manufacturers, but only a small minority are done unannounced in China and India. The U.S. government should require far greater on-site access and increase the funding and staff to implement that policy. It is also time to stop viewing the reimportation of drugs as a potential solution without serious downsides.

A strategy to diminish supply-chain risk must also take account of China's dependence on U.S. drugs. The U.S. is the world's predominant source of pharmaceutical innovation, including new cancer drugs, next-generation biopharmaceuticals and tests that determine which patients will benefit from those drugs. China is highly reliant on foreign sources of more-expensive brand-name drugs, which make up 90% of overall drug revenues, exporting only 1.2% of all medications in total value; the U.S. is among the top five exporters.

China is deeply dependent on U.S. cancer drugs in particular. Of those launched world-wide from 2013 to 2017, 51 of 54 were available within two years in the U.S. Only two were available in China. Cancer survival in China is only half that in the U.S. The Communist Party recognizes this problem. Its Healthy China 2030 Plan exempts most drugs from taxes and omits U.S. cancer drugs from tariffs placed on other medications in 2019.

China has emphasized generating new pharma patents. China now exceeds the U.S. in published applications, even though the U.S. still leads by a wide margin in patents that are ultimately granted. Mutual dependence on uninterrupted access to critical drugs, among both allies and adversaries, is a vital part of risk mitigation. Leaders should make clear that the U.S. will never withhold pharmaceuticals from other nations for coercive or punitive purposes, except when faced with hostile actions, such as acts of war.

Perhaps most important, policies must encourage pharma innovation and production. Reducing vulnerability to health threats such as Covid-19 rests on American discovery and competitiveness. While the U.S. leads the world in health-care innovation, this is no reason to be complacent. Congress should strengthen tax incentives for high-risk investments in early stage medtech and life-science companies, including drug development, and target additional incentives to domestic drug manufacturing.

Developing a new drug typically costs more than $2.5 billion and takes more than a decade. Safety standards shouldn't be compromised, but lengthy clinical trials can be streamlined. The FDA should continue the impressive work it began in 2016 to expedite drug approvals. During 2017 and 2018, yearly new drug approvals increased by around 70% relative to the eight years under the Obama administration. Finally, legislators must avoid the temptation to impose price regulation and limit patent protections. These measures delay drug launches, reduce access and crush research and development.

A secure drug supply chain couldn't have made up for the Chinese Communist Party's decision to conceal the threat of Covid-19. But it is essential for mobilizing resources to mitigate the crisis. And the stakes are high, even in normal times. More than 15 million American seniors, or 1 in 3, take five or more medications daily. As the U.S. population ages, society will become even more dependent on drugs indispensable to treating the biggest killers—heart disease, cancer and stroke. Preventing an interruption of the supply of vital medications that save lives and treat diseases, whether during pandemics or in routine care, is a matter of national security.",9,ForeignPolicy,,,1,,1,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"McRaven, William and Leiter, Michael",2014,1,2020-05-02,,1,0,WaPO,Navy,,,M,What We Can Learn Today from the Victory of the Osama Bin Laden Raid,"In a time of current national — and indeed global — crisis, it is too easy to pine for a moment when all seemed to go our way. Much more important is to remember why we had the victory we did. What worked for our country. What didn't work. And why seriousness, focus, and committment are still required to fix those things that may still be broken.","Nine years ago this month, Osama bin Laden's reign of terror as the leader of al-Qaeda came to an end. This date is etched in many of our memories. Americans and millions of others around the world felt a complex set of emotions: elation, relief, deep sadness from the events of 9/11 and the many of thousands of deaths that followed in combatting al-Qaeda and its allies in the years since.

For those of us who played a small part in the mission that led to bin Laden's death, this anniversary reminds us of something else: how to best protect our country. Although distilling exactly what led to success in a few words is impossible, its foundations are unmistakable. Nonpartisan teamwork, fact-based analysis, relentless focus on a national priority, self-sacrifice, rigorous and objective debate among a team striving for a clear goal, and humility even — in fact, especially — in the face of victory.

Above all, it is crucial to remember that this victory was the result of a unified vision, serious planning and thought, and sustained hard work. Not by Democrats, Republicans, independents or others. Not just by Americans but by all of those who had a common vision for a better tomorrow. Nine years ago, we saw what it took to make us all safer and provide a window for greater prosperity in years to come. We cannot forget what it took to get there then — and what it still takes today.

On May 1, 2011, this was true from the ground up. From the intelligence officers who collected and analyzed information, to the Special Operations forces who executed the raid, to the diplomats who handled the fallout, to the leaders in the Situation Room who debated and directed the operation. And of course, to the presidents who initiated the hunt for bin Laden — George W. Bush and Bill Clinton — and the president, Barack Obama, who oversaw the operation and ordered its execution.

In the moments after we learned of bin Laden's death, each of us in the Situation Room that day undoubtedly reflected in our own ways, whether it was recalling friends who had been lost in the previous decade or thinking about how this might help the strategic counterterrorism struggle ahead. Simultaneously, many of us were tasked to call senior officials around the world and in the United States to inform them of the victory. The list included past presidents, prime ministers, kings, lawmakers and senior officials within the U.S. government who didn't even know of the mission given its secrecy. Mike was also lucky enough to call one of the family members who lost a loved one on 9/11 — a call he will never forget and that still brings tears to his eyes today.

With all that occurred that day, we are quite sure none of us involved — not the brilliant intelligence community team that solved the puzzle, not the courageous special operators who risked everything in the dead of night, and not the officials who made calls or picked up the phones — ever gave a second of thought to the political persuasion of their counterparts. In a moment of national victory — one that had grown out of an incredible national crisis — we were simply professional colleagues who had worked together for a national and global priority. And during the entirety of the mission, I'm confident that no one had time for anything but hard-nosed, factual, objective analysis of how to best perform the mission.

None of this is to suggest that over the course of the preceding decade we had not made mistakes. We had — some repeatedly. Exactly what mistakes were made was (and continues to be) an appropriate subject of debate, scrutiny and remediation. And the debates themselves of course haven't been perfect, either. Some have been overtly partisan, some arguably misguided. But at least in the run-up to, and the hours of, May 1, 2011, these challenges were pushed aside in the name of not merely an American victory but a global victory for all who had suffered incalculable pain due to al-Qaeda's purely evil pursuits. American leadership had surely conducted and enabled the final mission, but it had done so only with the help of countless partners around the world who themselves had made enormous sacrifices.

In a time of current national — and indeed global — crisis, it is too easy to pine for a moment when all seemed to go our way. Much more important is to remember why we had the victory we did. What worked for our country. What didn't work. And why seriousness, focus, and commitment are still required to fix those things that may still be broken.",10,Support,,,,,,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Lieberman, Joe and Keane, Jack",2003,1,2020-06-02,,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,Dear Mr. President: Do Not Withdraw from Afghanistan,"Mr. President, please do not impose an unnecessary defeat on US forces, engage in a humiliating surrender, and retreat from an important front against some of our deadliest foes. You are right that we cannot and should not remain in Afghanistan forever simply to help Afghans build their nation. That is not why we went there, and is not why we are there today. ","President Trump is considering whether the United States should withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan this year. Doing so would be a humiliating surrender to an enemy we have already largely defeated. It would also be a disastrous error.

The U.S. military is in Afghanistan today fighting deadly enemies who continue to plan and prepare to kill Americans at home. It is not policing Afghanistan. It is not helping Afghans build their nation. It is performing missions only the U.S. armed forces can perform. If U.S. troops are withdrawn prematurely it is Americans, not just Afghans, who will suffer the consequences.

The United States entered Afghanistan in 2001 to defeat and expel al-Qaeda from the bases it used to launch the Sept. 11 attacks and to prevent the terror group from returning. We accomplished that aim in 2002 and have been struggling since then to find a way to leave Afghanistan without allowing al-Qaeda, and now the Islamic State, to regain an important safe haven.

There have been many errors and setbacks in that effort. But the force reductions that the president has already ordered will bring the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan below 10,000 this year. That is one-tenth the number who were there at the height of the U.S. war effort. Conducting a complicated withdrawal within the next few weeks entails extremely high risks and would likely result in unnecessary American casualties.

U.S. forces that remain in Afghanistan today are carrying out a clear and limited mission. They are not engaged in counterinsurgency. They are not engaged in nation-building. They are not police. They are no longer primarily supporting Afghan forces fighting the Taliban. They are instead laser-focused on fighting al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in ways that only the U.S. military can.

Afghanistan has become not a quagmire from which the United States must extricate itself, but rather a critical platform that the United States needs to keep deadly enemies off balance. The terror attack in Pensacola, Fla., in December was planned and supported by al-Qaeda leaders enjoying a partial safe haven in Yemen. Its aim and effects were limited in part because the United States has continued to target and kill leaders and key facilitators of that group in Yemen. It strongly suggests that, should terrorist groups regain a safe haven in Afghanistan as in Yemen, they will use it to plan and conduct attacks against the American homeland.

Trump promises to attack terrorists in Afghanistan if they threaten or attack Americans — even after U.S. forces leave, likely having the model of Yemen in mind. But Afghanistan is not Yemen. U.S. forces can hit targets in Yemen, Somalia, Syria and Libya without keeping large numbers of troops on the ground because those countries all have long coastlines. Afghanistan is landlocked. The most dangerous areas are more than 700 miles from the ocean, deep in valleys sheltered by mountains many thousands of feet high. U.S. forces can hit terror groups in Afghanistan only from bases inside Afghanistan. Giving up those bases means giving up much-needed and largely successful operations against those groups.

The costs of returning U.S. forces to Afghanistan once they leave are prohibitive, much more so than reentering Iraq after the catastrophic rise of the Islamic State. In 2014, the United States relied on logistical infrastructure and long-term basing in neighboring Kuwait; in contrast, the United States relies on precarious and sometimes threatened supply lines through Pakistan, where it lacks a base, to reach Afghanistan. Withdrawing from Afghanistan is likely irreversible.

The United States can afford the cost of fighting al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. The few thousand troops needed in Afghanistan represent a small fraction of the U.S. military and only a tiny fraction of the defense budget — to say nothing of the federal budget. U.S. commanders have recommended a residual presence even smaller than the United States now has. This small number of troops is a wise investment in protecting Americans against al-Qaeda. But withdrawing all troops dangerously exposes the American people. U.S. casualties in Afghanistan have been and will remain extremely low. And while we regret and mourn every one lost, we know that our servicemen and women (and their civilian counterparts) volunteer to risk their lives to defend their nation against deadly threats — and that they are prevailing against those threats in Afghanistan. They will not be grateful to have their sacrifices squandered.

Mr. President, please do not impose an unnecessary defeat on U.S. forces, engage in a humiliating surrender, and retreat from an important front against some of our deadliest foes. You are right that we cannot and should not remain in Afghanistan forever simply to help Afghans build their nation. That is not why we went there, and it is not why we are there today.

But we can and should remain there as long as we need to, at the small force levels required, to protect Americans from those who would kill us. You have rightly made that the mission of our troops in Afghanistan and everywhere they are deployed. Let them carry out that mission.",10,Warfighting,,,,,,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
89 Former Defense Officials,,1,2020-06-06,,1,0,WaPO,Various,,,Mixed,The Military Must Never Be Used to Violate Constitutional Rights,"Beyond being unnecessary, using our military to quell protests across the country would be unwise. This is not the mission our armed forces sign up for: They signed up to fight our nation's enemies and to secure - not infringe upon - the rights and freedoms of their fellow Americans. In addition, putting our servicemen and women in the middle of politically charged domestic unrest risks diminishing undermining the apolitical nature of the military that is so essential to our democracy. It also risks diminishing Americans' trust in our military - and thus America's security - for years to come. ","President Trump continues to use inflammatory language as many Americans protest the unlawful death of George Floyd and the unjust treatment of black Americans by our justice system. As the protests have grown, so has the intensity of the president's rhetoric. He has gone so far as to make a shocking promise: to send active-duty members of the U.S. military to ""dominate"" protesters in cities throughout the country — with or without the consent of local mayors or state governors.

On Monday, the president previewed his approach on the streets of Washington. He had 1,600 troops from around the country transported to the D.C. area, and placed them on alert, as an unnamed Pentagon official put it, ""to ensure faster employment if necessary."" As part of the show of force that Trump demanded, military helicopters made low-level passes over peaceful protesters — a military tactic sometimes used to disperse enemy combatants — scattering debris and broken glass among the crowd. He also had a force, including members of the National Guard and federal officers, that used flash-bang grenades, pepper spray and, according to eyewitness accounts, rubber bullets to drive lawful protesters, as well as members of the media and clergy, away from the historic St. John's Episcopal Church. All so he could hold a politically motivated photo op there with members of his team, including, inappropriately, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Looting and violence are unacceptable acts, and perpetrators should be arrested and duly tried under the law. But as Monday's actions near the White House demonstrated, those committing such acts are largely on the margins of the vast majority of predominantly peaceful protests. While several past presidents have called on our armed services to provide additional aid to law enforcement in times of national crisis — among them Ulysses S. Grant, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson — these presidents used the military to protect the rights of Americans, not to violate them.

As former leaders in the Defense Department — civilian and military, Republican, Democrat and independent — we all took an oath upon assuming office ""to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" as did the president and all members of the military, a fact that Gen. Milley pointed out in a recent memorandum to members of the armed forces. We are alarmed at how the president is betraying this oath by threatening to order members of the U.S. military to violate the rights of their fellow Americans.

President Trump has given governors a stark choice: either end the protests that continue to demand equal justice under our laws, or expect that he will send active-duty military units into their states. While the Insurrection Act gives the president the legal authority to do so, this authority has been invoked only in the most extreme conditions when state or local authorities were overwhelmed and were unable to safeguard the rule of law. Historically, as Secretary Esper has pointed out, it has rightly been seen as a tool of last resort.

Beyond being unnecessary, using our military to quell protests across the country would also be unwise. This is not the mission our armed forces signed up for: They signed up to fight our nation's enemies and to secure — not infringe upon — the rights and freedoms of their fellow Americans. In addition, putting our servicemen and women in the middle of politically charged domestic unrest risks undermining the apolitical nature of the military that is so essential to our democracy. It also risks diminishing Americans' trust in our military — and thus America's security — for years to come.

As defense leaders who share a deep commitment to the Constitution, to freedom and justice for all Americans, and to the extraordinary men and women who volunteer to serve and protect our nation, we call on the president to immediately end his plans to send active-duty military personnel into cities as agents of law enforcement, or to employ them or any another military or police forces in ways that undermine the constitutional rights of Americans. The members of our military are always ready to serve in our nation's defense. But they must never be used to violate the rights of those they are sworn to protect.",10,Warfighting,,1,,,,The officials blast the President's close use of the Insurrection Act to deploy the military to cities. ,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"VanLandingham, Rachel and Corn, Geoffrey",,1,2020-06-12,,1,0,USA Today,"Air Force, Army",,,Mixed,Military Brass Finally Speaks Up on Trump,"But the withdrawal cannot nullify the damage already done to our democracy by a president who either doesn't understand or doesn't care about the delicate balance between protection of public order, the right of the people to peacefully protest and the danger inherent in turning the military against our own citizens. ","President Donald Trump stood in the Rose Garden last week and announced that he was ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers"" in response to violence in Washington, D.C., amid protests against racial injustice.

Later that day, June 1, police and National Guard troops employed heavy-handed tactics to clear a path for a president who wanted a public spectacle to portray an image of strength. His walk to a nearby church to display a Bible, flanked by his top military leaders, left the public with what will undoubtedly become one of the most bizarre and troubling images in a presidency filled with head-scratching moments.

What many Americans did not see was that behind the scenes, active-duty units from the 82nd Airborne Division and elsewhere -- soldiers who are prepared to confront external enemies at a moment's notice -- had been deployed to staging areas on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., apparently part of Trump's plan to ""dominate the battle space,"" to use Defense Secretary Mark Esper's unfortunate phrase.

The president's instinct and willingness to resort to military force to respond to massive, predominantly peaceful and lawful protests -- protests triggered by a grotesque demonstration of police criminality reflective of pervasive racial disparities in our criminal justice system -- has been painfully obvious over the past week. His actions drove some of the most respected military leaders in our nation to break their silence and condemn the president's judgment and indifference to our shared constitutional values.

National 'inflection point'

As a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, explained, he spoke out because these events represent an ""inflection point"" for our nation.

Sadly, this rare moment in American history warns us that the power of the presidency is susceptible to abuse that jeopardizes the liberty and rights of Americans by improper use of a ""standing army."" Perhaps more important, it is also a crucial reminder of the vulnerability of the structural bulwarks against such abuse established by the Constitution and subordinate laws and policies. They can easily be bypassed by a president dismissive of these constraints and enabled by advisers who prioritize loyalty to his interests over fidelity to the fundamental principles of our republic.

It is not only former military leaders who recognize the danger. Esper's public disagreement with the president's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 -- a rarely used law that allows deployment of U.S. military personnel to bolster civilian law enforcement in situations of genuine extremis -- was an unusual, even remarkable rebuke of the president's deeply flawed instincts.

Equally remarkable is the criticism from numerous retired senior military leaders who, like Mullen, have felt compelled to suspend their normal reticence. Former Trump Defense Secretary James Mattis, former Trump chief of staff John Kelly and George W. Bush Secretary of State Colin Powell, as retired generals, in our view are acting as surrogates for current military leaders, who risk sanction for criticizing their commander in chief.

Such forceful condemnation of the president's willingness to unjustifiably turn the U.S. military against our own citizens reflects the significance of this moment. The Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, in an extraordinary message on June 2, reminded all members of the U.S. armed forces of their ultimate duty to respect the Constitution, its values and the dignity of all citizens. He went further Thursday, apologizing for his walk with Trump to St. John's Church. ""I should not have been there,"" he told National Defense University graduates.

Bulwarks against abuse of power

Perhaps Trump's order Sunday to withdraw the active-duty units deployed to Washington indicates that senior military officers were having some positive influence behind the scenes. Perhaps we will hear more about this if Esper and Milley agree to testify to Congress, as the House has been trying to arrange this week.

But the withdrawal cannot nullify the damage already done to our democracy by a president who either doesn't understand or doesn't care about the delicate balance between protection of public order, the right of the people to peacefully protest and the danger inherent in turning the military against our own citizens.

Instead, all Americans must understand how easily our bulwarks against abuse of power can be bypassed, and how extreme such an abuse must become before subordinate military commanders will be compelled to refuse orders flowing from that abuse.

We have indeed reached a national inflection point -- the point where we must all remember Benjamin Franklin's warning: ""Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.""",5,DomesticPolicy,,1,,,,The authors are blasting the President's move. ,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"Seidule, Ty",2020,1,2020-06-12,,1,0,WaPO,Army,,,M,West Point and its Cadets are not Campaign Props,"Black Activism changed the US Military Academy in 1971, and it is changing America in 2020. When Trump comes to the academy, he will think about hs photo-op among the cadets, and how such an image might burnish his credentials as a law-an-order president who spent lavishly on the military. But we should remember how Percy Squire and his fellow cadets defeated a President. Little did Nixon realize that African American West Pointers did indeed lead a ""moral rebirth of the Army."" And it's America's activists who led protests this month that will change this country for the better today. ","On Saturday, President Trump, like so many presidents before him, will give a graduation speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Despite a pandemic, mass unemployment and nationwide protests against racial injustice, the president is determined to have his photo op.

Resplendent in their gray uniforms, the disciplined cadets guarantee the president a friendly audience and magnificent backdrop for his photo — quite a different scene from the protesters tear-gassed during his ineffectual effort to craft an image of presidential leadership in front of St. John's Episcopal Church.

However, in this time of strife, Trump should be wary of using the U.S. Military Academy to further his political fortunes. One president tried that very strategy in the past. It didn't work.

In May 1971, President Richard M. Nixon visited the academy during a time of war and racial strife in the Army and the country. In his speech, he challenged the Class of 1971 to ""lead a moral rebirth of the Army.""

Afterward, Maj. Gen. William Knowlton, the academy's superintendent, showed Nixon the Battle Monument, a soaring granite column dedicated to the regular Army officers and soldiers who died during ""the War of the Rebellion."" In 1897, the U.S. Military Academy dedicated the monument to those who ""freed a race and welded a nation.""

As the superintendent explained the monument to Nixon, the president remarked: ""Oh, that's fine, general. Where's the one for the Confederate Army?""

""Well, sir,"" Knowlton replied, ""we don't have one up here.""

""Oh, general!"" Nixon exclaimed. ""I've been down to Alabama and I got a wonderful reception down there, and this is a time of healing. … You've got to get a monument up here to those Confederate dead.""

This remark exposed the problem with Nixon's concept of healing — he meant bringing white people together at the expense of black people. He also had an ulterior political motive. A Confederate monument at the U.S. Military Academy would further his ""Southern strategy,"" by providing a powerful symbolic statement that would appeal to all white people who saw racial equality as a political threat.

Nixon's idea to honor Confederates was problematic on several levels. A Confederate monument would glorify West Pointers who committed treason to preserve slavery. It would celebrate the Confederates' purpose — white supremacy. Finally, a memorial would tell African Americans that they were second-class citizens in their own country.

Back at the White House, Nixon followed up with several letters to Knowlton demanding a big Confederate monument dedicated in time for the Republican Convention in summer 1972.

Knowlton was worried. He knew a Confederate monument would devastate his successful efforts to recruit black cadets. A shrewd leader, Knowlton asked Percy Squire, the senior black cadet, for his thoughts on the monument. Rather than just give an answer, Squire began the most successful protest movement in the history of the U.S. Military Academy.

After a meeting with all African American cadets, Squire wrote a ""militant manifesto"" listing 13 demands. The manifesto described how as black men they entered the U.S. Military Academy with ""awe and expectation"" to improve the quality of leadership for all black soldiers. Instead, they found ""blatant racism.""

Institutional racism at the academy had a long history. The first black cadets in the 20th century were ""silenced."" No cadets would talk to them outside of official duties. The barracks remained segregated until 1954. Even after the end of segregation, no U.S. Military Academy class had more than a handful of black cadets.

After the academy started a minority admissions program, 47 black cadets arrived in the summer of 1969. As one cadet noted before they arrived, ""It wasn't possible to have a black identity. There just weren't enough of us."" Nixon's cynical Confederate monument idea combined with more than 100 black cadets created what Knowlton called ""nuclear fission.""

After every black cadet signed the manifesto, Squire persuaded 22 of the 23 black officers at the U.S. Military Academy to sign it. When the superintendent received the document, he gave the cadets everything they asked for. One demand was for social programs designed for black cadets. The cadets' social life at the isolated, all-male school was problematic. One young black woman described her visit to the academy with horror: ""We spent the whole evening square dancing!"" The cadets forced the academy to sponsor soul-themed dances.

The cadets felt that the U.S. Military Academy had forced them ""to abandon black culture."" Immediately, the academy allowed cadets to grow Afros.

Deploying their newfound power, the cadets persuaded the superintendent to invite controversial figures to speak that the academy had previously denied. Rep. Ronald Dellums (D-Calif.) had visited a dozen bases addressing systemic racism in the military. Now he came to the U.S. Military Academy with the blessing of its leadership. The cadets even brought Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak.

With victories on all fronts, the cadets' most important demand was to stop the Confederate monument. More significant was how they framed the argument. The cadets did not mention the issue of slavery. They knew that white Army officers would understand the argument of treason more readily. As a journalist at Ebony magazine described the cadets, ""Those were some savvy brothers.""

The African American cadets argued that West Pointers who fought for the Confederacy ""abrogated their oath"" to the Constitution. What if, as officers, the president called on them to quash a violent protest by black citizens?

If African American officers deserted their Army units to accept positions of leadership among ""rebelling Blacks"" in a hypothetical rebellion, would the U.S. Military Academy put up a monument to them? Or would they be punished as traitors? The Confederates, argued the cadets, committed treason, violating the Constitution by ""levying war against the United States."" They deserved censure, not recognition.

Thanking Squire, Knowlton called the White House to inform the administration that a Confederate monument would hurt minority recruiting efforts and cause a publicity nightmare.

The White House dropped the issue immediately. Squire and the other African American cadets defeated the president of the United States. Thanks to black cadet activism, there is no huge Confederate memorial staining West Point.

In 2015, another group of black activists, led by cadet Michael Barlow, convinced the U.S. Military Academy to name its newest barracks after Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., the first black cadet to graduate from West Point in the 20th century and the leader of the Tuskegee Airmen of World War II fame. A far more appropriate honor than the barracks just to the east, named for Robert E. Lee in 1970. After all, Lee renounced his oath and his troops killed U.S. soldiers.

Black activism changed the U.S. Military Academy in 1971, and it is changing America in 2020. When Trump comes to the academy, he will think about his photo op among the cadets, and how such an image might burnish his credentials as a law-and-order president who spent lavishly on the military. But we should remember how Percy Squire and his fellow cadets defeated a president.

But whom should the Army honor?

The number of Army heroes over the course of the service's 245-year existence is enormous. Here are just a few suggestions, drawing on soldiers and others who represent the strength, values and diversity of the Army's storied history.

These 11 individuals displayed extraordinary courage, competence and commitment. There are hundreds and hundreds of other worthy soldiers who could be honored. Our nation would not miss the names currently on these installations - and the Army has so many heroes to choose from.

Fort Hood (Tex.) to Fort Murphy
During World War II, Audie Murphy received every award for valor given by the U.S. Army, plus honors from France and Belgium. Murphy received the Medal of Honor for mounting a flaming tank destroyer and manning a .50-caliber machine gun, wounding or killing 50 German soldiers, by himself. Today, senior noncommissioned officers compete to join the Audie Murphy Club, a recognition of excellence.

Fort Polk (La.) to Fort Benavidez
After a terrible wound during his first tour of Vietnam, Master Sgt. Roy Benavidez volunteered to return in 1968 with his Special Forces unit. During ""six hours in hell,"" he saved the lives of eight fellow soldiers, for which he later received the Medal of Honor. At one point an enemy soldier stabbed Benavidez with a bayonet. Although grievously injured, Benavidez pulled the bayonet from his body, killed the man and continued his mission.

Fort Rucker (Ala.) to Fort Novosel
This post is home to Army aviation. Michael Novosel served in World War II as a B-29 pilot, flew again in the Korean War and then gave up his Air Force commission to serve as an Army warrant officer in Vietnam. In 1969, Novosel received the Medal of Honor for conducting 15 ""extremely hazardous"" aeromedical evacuations under enemy fire, saving 29 soldiers.

Fort Gordon (Ga.) to Fort Corbin
Like many women of that era, Margaret Corbin followed her husband into battle during the American Revolution. At Fort Washington, John Corbin manned an artillery piece protecting the evacuation of George Washington's Continental Army from Manhattan in 1776. When an enemy round killed John, Margaret Corbin took over the gun and continued to fire until stopped by wounds in her arm, chest and jaw. She was captured, but Washington made his escape. Corbin was the first woman to receive a military pension from Congress.

Fort A.P. Hill (Va.) to Fort Smith
During fighting in Iraq in 2003, Sgt. 1st Class Paul Smith protected an aid station from attack. When fellow soldiers found Smith's body, there were 13 bullets lodged in his protective vest. A bullet to the neck finally killed him, but his troops survived. Smith received the Medal of Honor posthumously.

Fort Benning (Ga.) to Fort Baker
Vernon Baker tried to enlist in 1941, but a recruiter rejected him because he was African American. After he was later allowed to join the Army, 1st Lt. Baker took command of a platoon in the segregated 92nd Infantry Division. While leading an assault in Italy, he single-handedly took out five German positions. Although three-quarters of his platoon died in the fighting, Baker volunteered the next day to lead the battalion's advance through a minefield. For his heroism, Baker received the Medal of Honor. He served the United States for more than a quarter-century, including in combat in Korea.

Camp Beauregard (La.) to Camp Rubin
In every war, the United States has relied on immigrants to fight for our country. Born in Hungary, Tibor ""Ted"" Rubin survived the Mauthausen concentration camp before U.S. troops liberated him. After emigrating, he joined the Army. During the Korean War, Rubin received the Medal of Honor for single-handedly defending a hilltop for 24 hours against waves of enemy attacks. Seriously wounded, Rubin was captured and spent 30 months in a prisoner-of-war camp, where he also distinguished himself by stealing food from guards for his fellow prisoners.

Fort Lee (Va.) to Fort Young
Charles Young graduated from West Point in 1889. By 1917, he was the only black colonel on active duty. During World War I, he should have been promoted quickly, but President Woodrow Wilson and the War Department would not allow him to command white troops. To prove his fitness, Young rode his horse about 500 miles from Wilberforce, Ohio, to Washington. Despite this impressive showing, he was still forced to retire. So he rode 500 miles home. Young's distinguished career for the United States continued in and out of uniform. Racism is the only reason Young did not become a senior officer. The country can acknowledge that error.

Fort Bragg (N.C.) to Fort Ridgway
Home of the XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Airborne Division, this fort should honor Matthew Ridgway, who commanded both units during World War II. During the Korean War, Ridgway took command of the Eighth Army, which was reeling from Chinese assaults. In just two weeks, he had the Army back on the attack, defeating the enemy in battle after battle.

Fort Pickett (Va.) to Fort Thomas
Virginia has three Army posts named for West Point graduates who committed treason. The country should honor a Virginian who remained loyal to the U.S. flag during the Civil War. George Thomas earned a reputation as a stellar battlefield commander at Chickamauga and Franklin. When he chose to remain loyal to the United States, his family disowned him. Thomas showed the kind of moral courage the Army demands.

Fort Belvoir (Va.) to Fort Grant
Who is Belvoir? Trick question. The answer is not a who but a what. Belvoir was the name of a slave plantation owned by a British loyalist. It burned to the ground in 1783. Few people realize that the post was called Camp A.A. Humphreys, for a Union general, until 1935. The fort is located only 15 miles south of the White House, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the change to appease Rep. Howard W. Smith (D-Va.), an avowed white supremacist. This name should be changed to Fort Grant, after Ulysses S.

The deal will hasten economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Even more important, it will counteract the Chinese Communist Party's aggression.","The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement took effect last week, and U.S. business and political leaders should be racing to take advantage of its benefits. The deal will hasten economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Even more important, it will counteract the Chinese Communist Party's aggression.

The reduction of trade barriers among the USMCA's parties will strengthen U.S., Mexican and Canadian supply chains, returning manufacturing jobs to North America from China. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic exposed how North America had become too dependent on China for medical equipment and drugs, Beijing's campaign of intimidation and censorship was already hurting international companies.

The pressure China inflicted on the National Basketball Association last year after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey voiced support for Hong Kong protesters is one of countless Communist Party demands that companies abandon liberal values, forgo criticism, and provide at least tacit support for the repression of the Chinese people. Implementing the USMCA provides an opportunity to minimize North American companies' exposure to the party's coercive power.

The U.S., Mexico and Canada must undertake the economic recovery together. Economists predict a post-Covid-19 economic recession of about 6% to 8% of gross domestic product for the U.S. and Canada. Mexico's recession is projected to be even deeper, between 8% and 10% of GDP, due in part to a weak economic stimulus package. If the Mexican economy, which relies heavily on currently distressed sectors like tourism, manufacturing and oil, lags behind the U.S. and Canada, consumers and workers in all three countries will suffer.

In Michigan alone, the sudden rupture of deeply interconnected supply chains in automobiles helped lead to the loss of more than a million jobs in less than two months. Exports from Michigan to Mexico amount to more than $10 billion a year. In contrast to trade with China, this trade with Mexico is characterized by much greater shared production. The percentage of American content in most Mexican exports to the U.S. is between 20% and 40%, while U.S. content in imports from China is approximately 4%.

A joint North American recovery will require diplomatic as well as economic therapies. U.S. and Canadian diplomats must convince the administration of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador that the expansion of North American trade is essential. Even before the pandemic, Mr. Lopez Obrador's populist policies and distrust of corporations were depressing Mexico's economy.

More than 40% of Mexicans live in poverty, yet the Mexican government announced abrupt cancellations of potentially lucrative projects, most notably a partially built Mexico City airport in 2018. In addition to lost jobs, government disruptions of that sort depress investor confidence.

After the virus struck, Mr. Lopez Obrador's odd mix of fiscal restraint and distrust of business led him to pursue a policy of austerity rather than fiscal stimulus. In June Mexico fell off consulting firm AT Kearney's list of the top 25 destinations for foreign investment.

But as the economy worsens -- another 8% of Mexicans may fall below the poverty line this year -- leaders may be ready to try a new cure. An overwhelming majority of Mexicans consider economic hardship to be the greatest challenge facing the country. Treatment could take the form of a U.S.-sponsored fiscal recovery plan for Mexico, using existing credit quotas at international institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as well as increased capital financing from the Inter-American Development Bank. In particular, Mexico should take advantage of its access to the IMF's flexible credit line, which allows countries with strong economic fundamentals and policy track records to obtain assistance before they face a full-blown crisis.

U.S., Canadian and Mexican officials should align guidance for economic reopening with the implementation of the USMCA's new rules-of-origin provisions. That would accelerate the reactivation of value chains in critical industries.

Public and private leaders who are already working together to satisfy demand for Covid-related essential products should shift discussions to a long-term vision for adapting North American economies to the post-Covid world. High-level forums, such as the U.S.-Mexico CEO Dialogue hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, will help identify opportunities for investment and joint ventures.

One discussion topic should be how to build resilient supply chains that reduce the corporate and national-security risk from Chinese espionage and unfair trade practices. Local business-to-business relationships play an important role. North American business organizations can help drive the near-term reactivation of regional production hubs and identify long-term ventures to capitalize on the repatriation of production to the region. All should work together to speed USMCA's implementation in key industries such as automobile and pharmaceutical manufacturing, aerospace and energy.

Improved economic cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico shouldn't be difficult. The countries share deep social and cultural ties strengthened by more than two decades of growing economic integration. When President Trump hosts Mr. Lopez Obrador at the White House this week, the two leaders should discuss implementing the USMCA in a way that will accelerate the economic recovery and alter critical supply chains, protecting trade from the whims of an increasingly aggressive Chinese Communist Party.

The people of North America, while recognizing that their democracies are works in progress, should be proud of their ability to demand reform, exercise their rights to freedom of expression, and live free under the rule of law rather than under fear of an authoritarian regime. Citizens should demand that their leaders uphold the principles of free trade, realize the gains associated with reciprocal market access, and ramp up an engine of production in our own hemisphere through the USMCA.",9,ForeignPolicy,,,1,,1,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

","Retired Brig. Gen. Anthony J. Tata is the right man for the job of undersecretary for policy at the Defense Department, and the Senate should confirm him. We served with Gen. Tata for decades and admire his extensive military and public service. He has been a strong voice for racial, ethnic and religious equality wherever he's worked. Recently some have called for his head over a few inflammatory tweets. We agree they were ill-considered, and he has apologized for sending them. Yet his critics ignore his unimpeachable record of combating racism and effecting change for the betterment of communities of color.

In 1997 and 2000, Mr. Tata was assigned to commands in the 82nd and 101st airborne divisions to fix racist and antigay cultures, following murders committed by a white supremacist soldier in Fayetteville, N.C., and the murder of a gay soldier in the barracks on Fort Campbell, Ky. The brass chose Mr. Tata to lead these units because of his strong leadership skills and reputation for treating all people with dignity and respect.

Charges of being anti-Muslim are absurd against a man who spent 18 months in Bosnia attempting to prevent the slaughter of Muslims, and six months in Kosovo and North Macedonia protecting nearly 100,000 Muslim refugees driven from their homes by Macedonian army tanks and infantry.

Perhaps what we admire most about Mr. Tata is that when he retired from the Army he declined several lucrative opportunities and instead pursued a career in education. As superintendent of public schools in Wake County, N.C., he implemented a diversity hiring program that focused on recruiting more teachers of color to better reflect the racial diversity of the district's student population.

A peer-reviewed study in the journal Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis credited him with establishing a policy that ""succeeded in moving the district toward the goal of equalizing access to advanced math coursework, both by increasing enrollment among Black students, Hispanic students, and students from economically disadvantaged families, and by reducing the role of these demographic factors in the course-assignment process."" AdvanceED, an independent accreditation agency, found that Mr. Tata fought for racial equity and unified a school system of 150,000 students in a county that had previously been divided over the topic of race and diversity.

That's meaningful change and real leadership. Based on his superb military service in key operational and strategic planning roles, and his combat leadership, including his record of inclusivity, diversity, creativity and success, Gen. Tata is the leader we need driving policy at the Pentagon and confronting the security challenges the nation faces.",8,Support,,,,,,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907

The circumstances of my departure might have been more public, yet they are little different from those of dozens of other lifelong public servants who have left this administration with their integrity intact but their careers irreparably harmed.

A year ago, having served the nation in uniform in positions of critical importance, I was on the cusp of a career-topping promotion to colonel. A year ago, unknown to me, my concerns over the president's conduct and the president's efforts to undermine the very foundations of our democracy were precipitating tremors that would ultimately shake loose the facade of good governance and publicly expose the corruption of the Trump administration.

At no point in my career or life have I felt our nation's values under greater threat and in more peril than at this moment. Our national government during the past few years has been more reminiscent of the authoritarian regime my family fled more than 40 years ago than the country I have devoted my life to serving.

Our citizens are being subjected to the same kinds of attacks tyrants launch against their critics and political opponents. Those who choose loyalty to American values and allegiance to the Constitution over devotion to a mendacious president and his enablers are punished. The president recklessly downplayed the threat of the pandemic even as it swept through our country. The economic collapse that followed highlighted the growing income disparities in our society. Millions are grieving the loss of loved ones and many more have lost their livelihoods while the president publicly bemoans his approval ratings.

There is another way.

During my testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, I reassured my father, who experienced Soviet authoritarianism firsthand, saying, ""Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth."" Despite Trump's retaliation, I stand by that conviction. Even as I experience the low of ending my military career, I have also experienced the loving support of tens of thousands of Americans. Theirs is a chorus of hope that drowns out the spurious attacks of a disreputable man and his sycophants.

Since the struggle for our nation's independence, America has been a union of purpose: a union born from the belief that although each individual is the pilot of their own destiny, when we come together, we change the world. We are stronger as a woven rope than as unbound threads.

America has thrived because citizens have been willing to contribute their voices and shed their blood to challenge injustice and protect the nation. It is in keeping with that history of service that, at this moment, I feel the burden to advocate for my values and an enormous urgency to act.

Despite some personal turmoil, I remain hopeful for the future for both my family and for our nation. Impeachment exposed Trump's corruption, but the confluence of a pandemic, a financial crisis and the stoking of societal divisions has roused the soul of the American people. A groundswell is building that will issue a mandate to reject hate and bigotry and a return to the ideals that set the United States apart from the rest of the world. I look forward to contributing to that effort.

In retirement from the Army, I will continue to defend my nation. I will demand accountability of our leadership and call for leaders of moral courage and public servants of integrity. I will speak about the attacks on our national security. I will advocate for policies and strategies that will keep our nation safe and strong against internal and external threats. I will promote public service and exalt the contribution that service brings to all areas of society.

The 23-year-old me who was commissioned in December 1998 could never have imagined the opportunities and experiences I have had. I joined the military to serve the country that sheltered my family's escape from authoritarianism, and yet the privilege has been all mine.

When I was asked why I had the confidence to tell my father not to worry about my testimony, my response was, ""Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I have served and defended, that all my brothers have served, and here, right matters.""

To this day, despite everything that has happened, I continue to believe in the American Dream. I believe that in America, right matters.

","In the 1997 film ""The Postman,"" set in post-apocalyptic America, Kevin Costner plays a drifter trying to restore order to the United States by providing one essential service, mail delivery. In the story, hate crimes, racially motivated attacks and a plague have caused the breakdown of society as we know it. In his quest to restore order and dignity to the nation, the Postman tries to recruit other postal workers to help rebuild the U.S. government. But Costner's character is opposed by the evil General Bethlehem, who is fighting to suppress the postal carriers so he can establish a totalitarian government. Fortunately, our hero, gaining inspiration from the motto, ""neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night,"" fights on against Bethlehem and saves the country.

Not surprisingly, the movie was panned by critics and was a financial disaster. I mean really, racial strife and a plague so bad that it threatened our society? And even if that happened, who would try to destroy the Postal Service? Where do they come up with these crazy plots?

In retrospect, maybe we should give the movie another look. Today, as we struggle with social upheaval, soaring debt, record unemployment, a runaway pandemic, and rising threats from China and Russia, President Trump is actively working to undermine every major institution in this country. He has planted the seeds of doubt in the minds of many Americans that our institutions aren't functioning properly. And, if the president doesn't trust the intelligence community, law enforcement, the press, the military, the Supreme Court, the medical professionals, election officials and the postal workers, then why should we? And if Americans stop believing in the system of institutions, then what is left but chaos and who can bring order out of chaos: only Trump. It is the theme of every autocrat who ever seized power or tried to hold onto it.

Our institutions are the foundation of a functioning democracy. While they are not perfect, they are still the strongest bulwark against overzealous authority figures. The institutions give the people a voice; a voice in the information we receive, a voice in the laws we pass, a voice in the wars we fight, the money we spend and the justice we uphold. And a voice in the people we elect.

As Trump seeks to undermine the U.S. Postal Service and stop mail-in voting, he is taking away our voice to decide who will lead America. It is not hyperbole to say that the future of the country could depend on those remarkable men and women who brave the elements to bring us our mail and deliver our vote. Let us ensure they have every resource possible to provide the citizens of this country the information they need, the ballots that they request and the Postal Service they deserve.

"Vindman, Alexander and Gans, John",,1,2020-10-01,,1,0,NYT,Army,,,M,Trump Has Sold off America's Credibility for His Personal Gain,"If Mr. Trump manages to stay in the White House, he’ll believe he has a mandate for more of this kind of deal-making…It's impossible to predict the damage to America's interests, power, credibility, relationships and reputation. ","From China to Ukraine, this president has acted at odds with American foreign policy. Imagine what he could do with four more years.

A year ago, the world read a record of a phone call in which President Trump pressured Ukraine’s government to provide dirt on his political rival, Joe Biden. The transcript of that call, along with other evidence, made clear the president and his associates asked officials in Kyiv to deliver on Mr. Trump’s political interests in exchange for American military aid needed to defend Ukraine. At the end of last year, the president was impeached for that abuse of power.

This was not a unique instance of Mr. Trump’s personal priorities corrupting American foreign policy. As the 2020 election grew closer, the president increasingly ignored the policies developed by his own government and instead pursued transactions guided by self-interest and instinct. The result is a patchwork of formal policies and informal deals that has undermined America’s interests and credibility. But Mr. Trump’s sloppy management matters less than its result: No one can trust American foreign policy right now.

Unfortunately, trust is the coin of the realm in national security. One of us, Lt. Col. Vindman, served in the military for more than two decades, including 19 months on Mr. Trump’s national security staff; the other, Mr. Gans, served at the Pentagon and wrote a book on how presidents from Harry Truman to Mr. Trump have made national security decisions. We know what it’s like to try to give advice and to be charged with carrying out policy. And we’ve both seen — in history and in recent years — what happens when decision-making becomes erratic and institutions break down.

Trust is why government officials have historically spent so much time around conference tables and in video teleconferences developing consistent, strategic policies. For a while, these practices continued under Mr. Trump. Career military officers, diplomats and members of the intelligence community worked with his political appointees to craft decisions and documents. But increasingly, the president and his loyalists in and out of government undermined this process with winks, nods and WhatsApp messages, seeking side transactions that prioritize personal benefit, break norms and invite corruption.

This is what happened with Ukraine. In March 2018, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that affirmed that it was the policy of the United States to stand by Ukraine and against any efforts that “threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.” But when the president picked up the phone last July, he was not focused on the stated policy but on his own re-election. The deal Mr. Trump looked to close on the phone was the culmination of a scheme cooked up by Russian agents and Trump loyalists. The result: Too many in Washington and Kyiv were left trying to figure out what the United States policy was.

It’s not just Ukraine. On China, Mr. Trump undermined the pressure of his own so-called trade war by pleading with President Xi Jinping behind closed doors to purchase commodities in critical electoral districts. Remarkably, Mr. Trump admitted as much last month, saying, “China has been buying a lot of — a lot of things, and they’re doing it to keep me happy.” Mr. Trump’s freelance dealings with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, such as invitations back into the Group of 7 and for a visit to the White House, have compromised American and NATO responses to Russian aggression.

In the homestretch before the election, Mr. Trump has overridden many of the remaining safeguards against bad deals, and ignores his professional advisers even more often. He is pulling out all the stops to rack-up last-minute wins before the November election. The president’s deals — American interests be damned — appear to have become the point alone. Unsurprisingly, other nations have taken notice, and some have been opportunistic enough to extract concessions before granting Mr. Trump the photo ops he so desperately desires.

Earlier this month, Mr. Trump brought the Kosovar and Serbian presidents to the White House to normalize economic relations, a longtime objective on both sides of the Atlantic. Unfortunately, that was not the deal signed — a moment best captured when Mr. Trump surprised Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vucic, with the news his country’s embassy was moving to Jerusalem (a move Mr. Vucic later walked back). Since that moment and before the ink dried, much of that deal has unraveled.

Mr. Trump also applied pressure to get the leaders of Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to the White House for an agreement that many experts believe did little to realize the regional “comprehensive peace agreement” promised by the administration’s official National Security Strategy. Instead, the engagement offered little more than a photo opportunity to help Mr. Trump’s re-election and may have undermined future efforts to achieve lasting and meaningful results in the region.

Mr. Trump’s predecessors have also, on occasion, made decisions and deals that served their political interests. But those deals typically aligned with America’s stated policies and its interests. The problem is that too often Mr. Trump’s deals do not.

And that’s just the deals we know about: Few people have any real idea of what is being promised in other calls and meetings. We may never know. This inconsistent, incomplete and inscrutable patchwork of foreign policy is not just inefficient, it risks disastrous mistakes by the United States and miscalculation by allies and adversaries alike. It also provides a potential opportunity for the sort of ethical misconduct that worries many about the debts and dealings exposed in new reports about Mr. Trump’s taxes.

No one, not even Mr. Trump, can say with confidence what American foreign policy is on any given issue these days. Such uncertainty is a source of stress and friction, leaving American military personnel, diplomats and intelligence officers not only out of the loop but also out of step with each other and with allies. After almost four years of this uncertainty, foreign government representatives simply shortcut the system and look for a White House back channel to figure out if the United States will zig when it’s supposed to zag.

Even worse, the uncertainty means that Americans themselves cannot know, or trust, all the deals being made in their name. Although Mr. Trump will spend the remaining weeks of the campaign talking about some deals and denying others, the true extent of his corruption of American foreign policy will not be known for many years. As Americans go to the polls, they may not understand what each of Mr. Trump’s deals includes. But they should know how and why he’s making them.

If Mr. Trump manages to stay in the White House, he’ll believe he has a mandate for more of this kind of deal-making. Re-election will remove the last remaining guardrail against the corruption of American foreign policy and drive anyone who seeks to avert disaster underground or out of government. It’s impossible to predict the damage to America’s interests, power, credibility, relationships and reputation.

But there is one thing to trust: Over four more years, there is little Mr. Trump won’t deal away.",5,DomesticPolicy,,1,,,,The authors are blasting the President. ,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"McMaster, H.R. ",2018,1,2020-10-11,,1,0,LA Times,Army,,,M,"US Foreign Policy's Narcissistc Turn: After the Cold War, a Shift Occurred. Here's How to Set Things Right.","No matter who is sworn in as president on Jan. 20, a concerted effort to build strategic competence and restore our confidence should be at the top of the agenda.","In 1989 I was a captain in the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment stationed in West Germany. Our regiment patrolled a stretch of the Iron Curtain that divided democracies and dictatorships. That November, the Berlin Wall fell and the Iron Curtain parted. The United States and the free world had triumphed over communist totalitarianism without firing a shot. The Soviet Union soon broke apart.

Just over a year later, those same cavalry troopers helped kick Saddam Hussein's army out of Kuwait.

In retrospect, those victories, which held the promise of so much, marked the end of an era. They led to overconfidence and complacency. Many leaders forgot that the United States had to compete in foreign affairs and embraced three flawed assumptions about the post-Cold War era.

The first assumption was that the arc of history guaranteed the triumph of free and open societies over authoritarianism, making the expansion of liberal democracy inevitable. The second assumption was that the old rules of international relations and competition were no longer relevant, and that global governance and great power cooperation would displace historical rivalries. The third assumption was that America's unmatched military prowess would guarantee victory over any potential enemy.

All three assumptions proved false.

Autocracy is alive and well -- in Russia, in North Korea and in numerous other countries. Jihadist groups such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have demonstrated they can neutralize U.S. superiority in conventional warfare by engaging in asymmetric warfare. And a new great-power competition has emerged, as Chinese Communist Party leaders have spoken the language of cooperation while conducting one of the greatest peacetime military buildups in history, suppressing freedom at home and exporting their authoritarian model.

The flawed assumptions we made at the end of the Cold War stemmed from strategic narcissism: the tendency to define problems as we would like them to be rather than as they actually are. In its extreme form, strategic narcissism can lead to the pipe dream of easy war (as in Iraq in 2003) or the delusion that wars end when one side decides to leave (as in Afghanistan today).

The excessive optimism of the 1990s eventually shifted to extreme pessimism, spurred by the financial crisis of 2008 and the unanticipated length and cost of wars in the Middle East. Calls for American disengagement have gained steam this year as the nation has confronted the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recession and social unrest sparked by the murder of George Floyd.

That pessimism is now leading us into different mistakes. It has generated a bias toward resignation, and a tendency to view retrenchment as the best way to reduce costs and advance American interests. For example, the Trump administration portrayed recent decisions to withdraw the small contingents of U.S. forces enabling Afghan and Iraqi forces to fight against jihadists as protecting -- rather than jeopardizing -- hard-won military gains.

That portrayal overlooks the lesson of the Obama administration's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, a move that created ideal conditions for a massive Islamic State offensive in 2014.

And we are making other mistakes. Although the Trump administration was right to demand that NATO allies do more to share the burden of collective defense, reducing U.S. forces in Europe is unwise at a time when Vladimir Putin's principal rival in Russia was recently poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent and the Kremlin threatens to quash calls for freedom in Belarus.

Today, strategic narcissism has fostered a sentiment common in both political parties that, after long and costly wars, U.S. disengagement from overseas challenges would be an unmitigated good and that the United States is the principal cause of the world's problems. Our presence abroad, the naysayers argue, creates enemies, inflames jihadist terrorism and drives nuclear proliferation.

In reality, American behavior did not cause these problems, and American disengagement would not solve them.

There is an alternative: sensible and sustained engagement. The COVID-19 experience reinforces a fundamental lesson of Sept. 11, 2001: Threats originating abroad, if not checked, can move rapidly across our world. Once they penetrate our shores, the cost to Americans can be immense. Moreover, it is much cheaper to deter Russia or China with strong alliances and forward-positioned American forces than it would be to bear the costs of a catastrophic war triggered by Russian or Chinese aggression.

The balance of power has been shifting against the United States and other free and open societies. Much of that shift has been self-inflicted. Strategic narcissism has fueled both over-optimistic policies that underestimated the risks of action and pessimistic policies that underestimated the risks of inaction.

We need now to embrace what the historian Zachary Shore terms strategic empathy, the recognition that others exercise influence over our collective future. Empathy displaces narcissism with an appreciation of the aspirations, and ideologies that drive and constrain our rivals. For example, understanding that Putin is driven by a sense of honor lost after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and a longing to restore his country to national greatness at the West's expense should disabuse U.S. and European leaders that relations with Russia can improve while he is in power.

But improved competence based on strategic empathy is not enough. America must also rebuild confidence at home. As the late philosopher Richard Rorty observed, ""National pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement."" If we lack self-respect, how can we fight effectively in war or implement a competitive foreign policy?

While keeping in mind the need for self-criticism and the acknowledgment of imperfections in our democracy, Americans must rediscover and celebrate the virtues and great promise of our nation, embracing the principles in our founding documents that bind us together. Our political disunity is a vulnerability as great as our strategic narcissism.

No matter who is sworn in as president on Jan. 20, a concerted effort to build strategic competence and restore our confidence should be at the top of the agenda.",9,ForeignPolicy,,,,,,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,36.2713407,31.4835907
"McRaven, William",2014,1,2020-10-29,,1,0,WSJ,Navy,,,M,Biden Will Make America Lead Again; We Need a President with Decency and a Sense of Respect,I voted for Joe Biden,"In their 1998 book, ""A World Transformed,"" George H.W. Bush and Brent Scowcroft recount the events that fundamentally changed the world during the Bush presidency. At the end of the last chapter Bush observes: ""The importance of American engagement has never been higher. If the United States does not lead, there will be no leadership . . . If we fail to live up to our responsibilities, if we shirk the role that only we can assume, if we retreat from our obligation to the world in indifference, we will one day pay the highest price once again for our neglect and shortsightedness.""

For all the challenges the past 20 years brought on this country -- for all the loss, the heartache, the hubris and the errant decisions -- in times of crisis, the world still looked to America to lead. They believed that in spite of our political differences, our domestic turmoil, the ugliness of our democratic process and some bad decisions, America in the end would do the right thing. That we would stand up to tyranny, lift up the downtrodden, free the oppressed, and fight for the righteous.

Now, the world no longer looks up to America. They have been witness to our dismissiveness, our lack of respect and our transactional approach to global issues. They have seen us tear up our treaties, leave our allies on the battlefield and cozy up to despots and dictators. They have seen our incompetence in handling the pandemic and the wildfires. They have seen us struggle with social injustice. They no longer think we can lead, because they have seen an ineptness and a disdain for civility that is beyond anything in their memory. But, without American leadership the world will indeed be transformed, just not in the way we hope.

This could all change in November.

We need a president who understands the importance of American leadership, at home and abroad. We need a leader of integrity whose decency and sense of respect reflects the values we expect from our president. We need a president for all Americans, not just half of America.

This week I went to the polls in Texas. Truth be told, I am a pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, small-government, strong-defense and a national-anthem-standing conservative. But, I also believe that black lives matter, that the Dreamers deserve a path to citizenship, that diversity and inclusion are essential to our national success, that education is the great equalizer, that climate change is real and that the First Amendment is the cornerstone of our democracy. Most important, I believe that America must lead in the world with courage, conviction and a sense of honor and humility.

If we remain indifferent to our role in the world, if we retreat from our obligation to our citizens and our allies and if we fail to choose the right leader, then we will pay the highest price for our neglect and shortsightedness.

"McMaster, H.R. ",2018,1,2020-11-11,,1,0,WSJ,Army,,,M,Ponder the Rewards of Military Service,"America's veterans have served on teams committed to excellence in which bigotry, racism and other forms of intolerance and prejudice have no place. Veterans want their fellow citizens to be bound through a sense of common purpose, mutual respect and willingness to sacrifice. Perhaps pondering the rewards of service could help Americans transcend political and social differences, regain confidence in our national character and restore pride in the republic that veterans fought to preserve.","Fewer and fewer Americans are connected to the country's all-volunteer professional military. The military's separation from society is consequential. In a democracy, if citizens don't understand the military, they won't support the policies and investments necessary to secure the nation.

Veterans Day is an opportunity to consider what compels servicemen and -women to act courageously, endure hardships, take risks and make sacrifices. For many Americans it is easy to imagine the hardships associated with military service, such as long separations from family or arduous conditions. It is more difficult to understand the less tangible rewards of service.

One reward of service is being part of a community that sustains itself through an ethos that binds warriors to one another. That covenant is based on honor, duty, courage, loyalty and self-sacrifice. An effective military unit takes on the qualities of a family, in which the man or woman next to you is willing to give everything, even his or her own life, for you. Many veterans miss that military family when they rejoin civilian life. As the psychiatrist and author Jonathan Shay has noted, ""what a returning soldier needs most when leaving war"" is ""a living community to whom his experience matters.""

Another reward of service is a veteran's pride in having exhibited courage and compassion. American veterans are both warriors and humanitarians because they engage against enemies that are a threat to all civilized peoples. Older veterans defeated Nazi fascism, Japanese imperialism and communist totalitarianism. Since the most devastating terrorist attack in history on Sept. 11, 2001, America's younger veterans have been engaged against enemies who use a perverted interpretation of religion to promote hatred and violence against innocents.

Veterans Day is a chance to express gratitude for the sacrifices American warriors make, but it is also an opportunity to welcome veterans into our communities and encourage them to join organizations such as nonprofits Spirit of America or Team Rubicon that bring them together with each other and their fellow citizens. A more complete view of the rewards of service might help attract young volunteers to the armed forces.

America's veterans have served on teams committed to excellence in which bigotry, racism and other forms of intolerance and prejudice have no place. Veterans want their fellow citizens to be bound through a sense of common purpose, mutual respect and willingness to sacrifice. Perhaps pondering the rewards of service could help Americans transcend political and social differences, regain confidence in our national character and restore pride in the republic that veterans fought to preserve.",9,Support,,,,,,,72,116,2019,0.872648552,0.840090177,47.84,52.51
"Allen, Thad ",2010,1,2020-11-12,,1,0,WaPO,Coast Guard,,,M,Trump is Failing to Provide For the Common Defense,"The president's refusal to cooperate with President-elect Joe Biden and make transition resources available to him fails the basic promise of the preamble to the Constitution to ""provide for the common defense"" and ""promote the general welfare.""","I belong to no political party. I abhor inefficiency and established my career in the Coast Guard by breaking through unnecessary bureaucratic barriers and challenging the status quo.

I have worked for two presidents from different parties who faced national crises. Outcomes that meet the expectations of the public require unity of effort, shared trust and, when required, the subordination of political and self-interest to the common good.

More is at stake today than at any time in my lifetime, including 9/11, when we had Coast Guard cutters with their guns uncovered in New York Harbor, a sight I thought I would never see.

Today, we have an invisible and ubiquitous adversary that demands a national unified response.

We need vaccine development and distribution. We need to create protocols to reopen the economy. At the same time, we must protect ourselves from foreign adversaries and defend cyberspace. That requires providing the president-elect and his team with intelligence briefings and access to the agencies across the government.

Protecting our national and health security interests requires the coordination and cooperation between the departing team of the 45th president and the incoming team of the 46th. For the sake and health of the American people, that work should start today.

The president's refusal to cooperate with President-elect Joe Biden and make transition resources available to him fails the basic promise of the preamble to the Constitution to ""provide for the common defense"" and ""promote the general welfare.""

This is a time for intense cooperation, not a stiff arm.

The president-elect and his team should not have to make plans in a vacuum. Biden's transition team should have access to key government agencies and to career federal employees critical to planning for a seamless response when they take office. The administration can provide the Biden team with intelligence briefings and access to government agencies even as the president pursues his legal challenges.

This failure to cooperate is unthinkable in the face of a growing, increasingly unattended, pandemic. While we still have a short time to avoid the worst, the clock is ticking.

As an example, the Trump administration launched Operation Warp Speed, an ambitious joint Pentagon and Department of Health and Human Services effort to develop and distribute coronavirus vaccines once these medicines receive approval for safety and effectiveness.

The success of this effort will be driven by our government's ability to get 300 million coronavirus shots into the arms of the American people. Americans would be better served if the Biden team were engaged today. Not tomorrow, today.

I've seen failure of this kind take a toll before. As I flew into New Orleans by helicopter on Sept. 6, 2005, the devastation from Hurricane Katrina defied description. It was as if the city had been hit by a weapon of mass destruction; New Orleans remained underwater and literally ungoverned a week after the storm made landfall.

Beyond the immediate need for rescue, food, water and shelter, there was a loss of continuity of government, including the inability to establish command and control over efforts to help alleviate immense suffering and needless death.

This gut-wrenching experience serves as a cautionary tale as we witness the unprecedented post-election disregard for the safety and security of the nation.",10,DomesticPolicy,,1,,,,"The auhor seems to be evaluating Trump's behavior from the standpoint of what might seem reasonable behavior, which by itself is fine.
